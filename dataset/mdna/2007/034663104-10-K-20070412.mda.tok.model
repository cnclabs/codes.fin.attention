overview angelica is a leading provider of outsourced linen management services to the healthcare industry in the united states 
we offer comprehensive linen management services to the us healthcare industry  including hospitals  long term care facilities  surgery centers  medical clinics  and other medical providers 
among the items that we clean and provide  on either a rental or customer owned basis  are bed linens  towels  gowns  scrubs  surgical linens and surgical packs  as well as mops  mats and other dust control products 
to a more limited extent  we also provide linen management services to customers in the hospitality business 
currently  we operate laundry service centers in sixteen states and serve customers in states 
since july our continuing operations have consisted exclusively of linen management services delivered primarily to the healthcare industry 
in fiscal  healthcare linen services represented approximately of our revenues  with of revenues from other linen service markets 
although our fiscal year has not changed  we changed the terminology describing our fiscal year in february we now  and retroactively  refer to the fiscal year by the calendar year in which the first months of the fiscal year fall 
fiscal year started on january  and ended on january   fiscal year started on january  and ended on january   and fiscal year started on february  and ended on january  revenues are recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer 
our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or over the four year period 
while a portion of our growth has been achieved organically by expanding relationships with existing customers and adding new customers  we began adding to this growth with acquisitions in fiscal going forward  we expect to accelerate our annual organic growth rate to through the customer focused programs described herein  and to potentially supplement this growth with additional acquisitions consistent with board approved debt guidelines 
our acquisition program is focused on healthcare laundry services currently owned either by hospitals or competitors 
since we seek to concentrate our service centers in clusters enabling us to better service our customers and providing us with economies of scale  we primarily look for opportunities within or around our existing markets  especially opportunities to consolidate volume into our existing facilities 
although we may expand geographically via acquisition  this will most likely be on the fringes of existing service areas 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we consider strategic value  projected earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  impact on earnings per share  return on net assets and internal rate of return 
cost of services are recognized and recorded as incurred 
over the last five years  our cost of services as a percent of revenues have ranged from a low of in fiscal to a high of of revenues in fiscal  primarily due to the volatility of energy costs 
the major components of our cost of services are linen depreciation  which represented of revenues in fiscal  versus in fiscal  direct and indirect production labor and fringe benefit costs  which represented of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal  utilities  which represented of revenues in fiscal and fiscal this includes natural gas  which was of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal  and delivery expenses  which represented of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal this includes delivery fuel expense which was of revenues in fiscal compared with in fiscal in fiscal we continued implementing our operations process improvement project that is expected to lower our cost of services through more efficient operations and best practices implementation 
in addition  we plan to reduce cost of services by continuing to improve linen and natural gas procurement  implementing new delivery planning and routing technology  and making capital investment in our facilities to increase labor productivity and reduce energy utilization 
after successful testing  in fiscal we began expanding a global positioning system and delivery software capabilities to all of our service centers 
we expect this to be fully functional in all service centers in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we have instituted a standardization process for purchasing linens and changed our energy hedging policy to an operational model from an economic model  allowing us to take advantage of longer term buying opportunities for natural gas in the f uture 
since october we have entered into futures contracts to reduce our exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
these contracts  combined with existing fixed price contracts for the physical delivery of natural gas  effectively fix the cost for approximately of our total natural gas requirements for fiscal  and and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we will continue to seek either customer contract pricing that is variable with energy costs or attractive natural gas purchasing opportunities with a goal of locking in natural gas prices and quantities for periods that roughly match up with customer contract expirations when contracts provide inadequate protection against rising prices 
over the past four years  our gross profit has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during this period  gross margin has ranged from in fiscal to in fiscal our goal of reaching a gross margin by fiscal will be impacted by a number of factors  including our ability to obtain price increases equal to the inflationary pressures we experience 
while the majority of our customer contracts have inflation pricing escalator clauses based on various consumer price indexes  or cpi  the aggregate annual price increases are sometimes capped and the costs listed above affect us to a greater degree than the cpi  as they comprise a much larger part of our cost structure 
in addition  mounting pressure on our healthcare customers to contain costs has somewhat curtailed our ability to negotiate price increases in line with inflation 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future energy availability or costs  but we believe our energy hedging policy will allow us to lessen our energy cost volatility and take advantage of pricing opportunities in the energy market in the future 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include all other operating expenses not included in cost of services  including those related to sales and marketing  human resources  accounting  information systems  and other administrative functions not allocable to individual customers 
in fiscal  sg a expenses were million  representing of revenues compared with million  or of revenues in fiscal of the fiscal sg a expense  million was attributable to our service centers and million was attributable to our atlanta and st 
louis corporate offices 
we expect sg a expense to continue to decline as a percent of revenues as we continue to grow our business organically and through acquisition and spread the fixed components of these costs over a larger revenue base 
our revenues experience modest seasonality in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to declines in hospital census counts and outpatient procedures around holiday weeks  as patients typically choose not to schedule elective procedures and physicians take vacations 
we estimate that this typically results in fourth quarter revenues from existing customers being approximately less than in the third quarter 
our business is also impacted by some seasonality associated with two major cost areas production labor and natural gas costs 
production labor costs typically rise in the fourth and first quarters as a percentage of revenues  as holiday pay and overtime associated with holidays increase fourth quarter labor costs and most of our labor contract wage increases take effect in the first quarter 
natural gas costs also increase in the winter months included in the fourth and first quarters  reflecting natural gas pricing and usage in the winter months 
these two costs typically are to of revenues higher in the fourth and first quarters than in the second or third quarters 
results of continuing operations fiscal year ended dollars in thousands january  january  january  revenues   cost of services   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expense   amortization of other acquired assets  other operating income  net   income from operations   interest expense   non operating income  net   income before income taxes  income taxes   income from continuing operations  analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to revenues of million in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal organic growth from net new business additions and price increases contributed million of the increase  representing an organic growth rate of 
fiscal acquisitions contributed million of the increase  which was more than offset by the loss of million of revenues due to the sale of non healthcare customer accounts in fiscal and healthcare revenues increased by in fiscal to million  while non healthcare revenues decreased from fiscal  due primarily to the sales of the non healthcare accounts in california and texas 
as part of our long term strategy to concentrate marketing efforts on customers in the healthcare industry  we anticipate a continued decline in non healthcare revenues as a percent of total revenues in future periods 
cost of services of million in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal as normal inflationary increases for labor and higher natural gas costs were more than offset by favorable experience in several other cost categories 
the change in the estimated useful life of linens  as discussed below in critical accounting policies and judgments linens in service  offset increased linen purchases and resulted in a decrease in linen depreciation as a percentage of revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal initiatives put into place in recent years to create a safer work environment led to favorable workers compensation experience over the prior year  as related expense decreased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal an increase in delivery fuel expense of million was more than offset by cost savings recognized from transferring several customer accounts among service centers to increase efficiency  resulting in a decrease in total delivery expenses as a percent of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal current year organic revenue growth and pricing improvements  along with cost of services which were essentially flat year over year  allowed gross margin to increase to in fiscal from in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal  while remaining fairly constant at of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses resulted primarily from an increase in professional fees of million related to our operations process improvement implementation and financial consulting projects  an increase in legal and shareholder relation expenses of million associated with the board of directors special committee  million in higher incentive compensation accruals  and million of higher life insurance expense net of dividends 
in fiscal sg a expenses included million related to the union corporate campaign  million associated with our evaluation of alternatives to our then existing debt structure  and million due to changes in our senior management 
amortization expense increased from fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the full year impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the royal acquisition in march and the bob white acquisition in august in fiscal we reported other operating income of million  reflecting gains from the sale of three parcels of real estate and a settlement received from the lawsuit that was initiated in connection with the vallejo eminent domain proceedings in fiscal in fiscal we reported other operating income of million which included the net gain of million on the sale of the san diego  stockton  and long beach  california non healthcare accounts 
interest expense in fiscal was million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase resulted from a combination of higher interest rates and higher average borrowings 
interest rates increased from an average per annum in fiscal to an average per annum in fiscal at january   we had million in total debt outstanding under a revolving loan agreement with a bank credit facility and million of life insurance policy loans outstanding 
a significant portion of our outstanding debt at january   bore interest at variable rates 
we expect interest expense to decrease over the next fiscal year as we pay down our credit facility 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating income of million  consisting primarily of a million gain on the sale of real estate  interest income of million  and a million gain from the death benefit of a company owned life insurance policy  partially offset by a million loss related to a natural gas derivative 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating income of million which included a million distribution from the liquidation of the parent company of the issuer of life insurance policies we own and million death benefits of company owned life insurance policies  along with interest on invested cash balances and notes receivable  and loss related to our natural gas hedge 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal and million in fiscal both years reflect the impact of deductions related to company owned life insurance policies and tax credits from employment programs 
in addition  during fiscal  we reversed a million tax contingency reserve due to the expiration of the related tax statute 
income from continuing operations increased million  or  in fiscal  due primarily to the increase in gross profit as explained above  partially offset by the decrease in other operating income and increase in interest expense 
analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to revenues of million in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal acquisitions during fiscal contributed million of the revenue increase  offset in part by the loss of million of revenues due to the sale of non healthcare customer accounts 
fiscal benefited from a full year of revenues from acquisitions completed in fiscal  which accounted for another million of the revenue increase in fiscal organic growth in revenues was million  or  due to an average price increase  plus a volume increase 
consistent with our strategic plan to concentrate marketing and acquisition efforts on customers in the healthcare industry  healthcare revenues increased by in fiscal to million 
non healthcare revenues decreased from fiscal  due primarily to the sales of the non healthcare accounts in san diego  long beach and stockton  california in fiscal  and daytona b each  florida in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by non healthcare accounts obtained in our january acquisition of two texas facilities from national service industries 
cost of services of million in fiscal increased million or from fiscal after adjusting for the increase in volume  utilities increased million in fiscal  due primarily to higher natural gas costs 
delivery fuel increased by million compared with fiscal  and direct labor expense increased million due to higher wage rates and benefits and increased temporary labor 
competitive pressures in the marketplace limited our ability to offset these cost increases through higher customer pricing 
in addition  annual cpi price increases on many existing contracts were not reflective of our underlying cost increases since the cpi indexes used in those contracts do not weight utilities costs and workers compensation and healthcare insurance expense in the same manner as these items are weighted in our actual cost of services 
due to the aforementioned factors  gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fisc al selling  general and administrative expenses of million decreased as a percent of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal bad debt expenses were approximately million in fiscal compared to less than million in fiscal  a result of a significant increase in accounts receivable and specific reserves for certain receivable balances whose collectibility is uncertain 
other factors causing these expenses to not decline further from prior year as a percent of revenues include million of legal expenses associated with a union campaign  initial organizational expenses and the board of directors special committee  million of management transition expense related to our senior management change and fourth quarter reorganization  million expended evaluating alternatives to our debt structure  and million incurred related to the best practices improvement project 
amortization expense increased million in fiscal  reflecting the impact of intangible assets acquired in fiscal and fiscal other operating income of million in fiscal benefited from the net gain of million on the sale of the san diego  stockton  and long beach  california non healthcare accounts 
we reported other operating income in fiscal of million which included the net gain of million on the sale of the daytona beach non healthcare accounts and a gain of million on the settlement of a property insurance claim 
interest expense in fiscal was million  an increase of million over the million of interest expense incurred in fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects the increase in indebtedness due to the acquisitions closed in fiscal and fiscal and higher interest rates 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating income of million which includes a million distribution from the liquidation of the parent company of the issuer of life insurance policies we own and million of death benefits of company owned life insurance policies  along with interest on invested cash balances and notes receivable  and loss related to our natural gas hedge 
we recorded non operating income of million in fiscal  resulting mainly from gains of million from the sale of real estate we owned in miami  florida from a facility that was closed in fiscal  million from death benefits on company owned life insurance policies  and million received in a bankruptcy settlement of a receivable related to a former business 
for fiscal we recorded a tax benefit of million versus an income tax expense of million in fiscal lower income tax expense in fiscal as compared with the prior year was primarily due to lower pretax income 
income from continuing operations declined million  or  in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from the combination of higher prices for natural gas  delivery fuel and labor that negatively impacted gross profit  increased intangible amortization related to our recent acquisitions  higher interest expense that reflected both acquisition borrowings and higher rates  and lower non operating income 
these items were partially offset by an increase in other operating income resulting from fiscal asset sales and the current year income tax benefit 
discontinued operations exit from st 
louis market and sale of columbia  illinois facility fiscal on september   we sold the customer contracts serviced by our columbia  illinois facility and certain other assets related to the servicing of those contracts for million in cash 
the columbia facility  which primarily served the st 
louis market area  had been unprofitable for several periods and in fiscal suffered the loss of a major customer 
due to the limited potential to improve the profitability of the facility  combined with its relative geographic isolation from our other facilities  the decision was made to exit the st 
louis market  sell its customer contracts and related assets  and pursue a sale of the idle facility 
in the third quarter of  we recorded both a goodwill writeoff of million associated with the business of the columbia facility and an asset impairment charge of million related to the facility s real estate and personal property 
in january  the real estate and personal property were sold for approximately million in cash  resulting in an additional asset impairment charge of under million 
in connection with the sale of the facility s assets  we recorded an after tax loss on disposal of million for the fiscal year 
from the beginning of the fiscal year until the sale of the customer contracts in september  the columbia facility reported a net loss from operations of million  as compared to a net loss from operations of million for the full fiscal year 
the loss from operations in fiscal includes million in employee termination expenses 
the net operating loss for each of the prior fiscal years has been included in net loss from discontinued operations 
sale of retail segment fiscal in february  our board of directors approved a plan to exit and discontinue our retail segment 
we completed the sale of our retail business at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and recorded a loss on disposal of the discontinued segment of million net of tax in fiscal as part of the consideration for the sale  we received an unsecured  long term note from the buyer with a face value of million  which we discounted to its then estimated fair value of approximately of face value 
although we believe that the discounted note is fairly valued  this note is not readily marketable and is subordinate to other outstanding debt of the buyer 
ultimately  the value of the note is dependent upon the success of the buyer in operating the purchased business 
there were retail stores that were not included in the sale of our retail segment  although the buyer did acquire the working capital related to those stores 
we immediately closed these stores and incurred million of costs in fiscal to terminate the leases 
during fiscal we recognized million in expense related to additional tax impact on the sale of the retail business segment and other discontinued operations 
this amount is included in net loss from disposal of discontinued operations 
from the beginning of the fiscal year until its ultimate sale in july  we operated the retail division as a discontinued operation and we reported a net loss from operations of our retail business of million during this partial period 
this net operating loss for the first half of has been included in net loss from discontinued operations 
we agreed pursuant to the terms of the retail transaction to retain our guaranty on those real estate leases for retail stores that were supported with our guaranty on the date of the closing of the sale 
under the terms of our agreement with the buyer of the retail segment  our guaranty on each of these leases will remain until the end of the current term of the particular lease at which time it must be released 
we do not believe that we will incur any additional losses from these guarantees or any other issue arising from these discontinued operations in future periods 
financial condition as of january   working capital totaled million as compared with million in working capital at the end of fiscal the current ratio ie  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at the end of fiscal and fiscal the increase in working capital is due primarily to a higher balance in linens in service as explained below 
accounts receivable decreased by million in fiscal due primarily to the collection of a prior year receivable related to the sale of our long beach facility 
linens in service increased by million as a result of a significant injection of linens into the system to increase our customer order fill rates 
the decrease in total property and equipment of million resulted primarily from the sale of our rio vista facility  depreciation expense  and lower capital expenditures 
cash surrender value of life insurance at january   is presented net of approximately million of life insurance policy loans outstanding 
in addition to the million of loans outstanding which are netted against the cash surrender value  we also had million in life insurance policy loans outstanding which are considered current liabilities 
other long term assets include the value of the note receivable in the principal amount of million from the sale of our retail business which we carried at a discounted value of million as of january  although we believe the discounted note is fairly valued  this note is not readily marketable and is subordinate to other outstanding debt of the buyer 
ultimately  the value of the note is dependent upon the success of the buyer in operating the purchased business 
accounts payable decreased million in fiscal due to the timing of invoices in prior year 
the increase in current liabilities related to our natural gas hedges was mostly offset by a decrease in insurance reserves 
long term debt of million as of january   was slightly higher than the million as of the previous year end 
other long term liabilities of million were an increase of million from the prior year and consist primarily of liabilities related to our natural gas hedges 
our ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of january  was  up slightly from as of january  book value per share decreased to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the current year decrease resulted primarily from a million increase in linen purchases to support our order fill strategy  increased interest payments of million reflecting both higher interest rates and higher borrowings due to a full year of borrowings related to the royal acquisition and the pay down of accounts payable to more normal levels that used million of cash 
in addition  lower income tax refunds and an increase in required minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plan contributed to the decline in cash flow from operating activities 
for fiscal year  we anticipate that increases in our required linen purchases will be consistent with growth in our business levels and that our interest payments will decline slightly from however  our required pension contributions are currently estimated to increase by million in fiscal cash flows from investing activities included million in capital expenditures  down from million in the prior year as we implement best practices systemwide before incurring discretionary capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from the sales of various real estate properties and million from the death benefits of two company owned life insurance policies 
the gain on one of these death benefit proceeds was recognized in fiscal for fiscal year  we expect capital expenditures to return to more normal levels  in the range of million to million 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal reflecting dividend payments of million offset partially by the net proceeds of million from life insurance policy loans and million proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash used by discontinued operations in fiscal related primarily to termination payments made to union sponsored multi employer defined benefit plans 
financing arrangements our long term bank borrowings are financed through a million revolving credit facility under a loan agreement that matures on november  amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to either i libor plus a margin  or ii a base rate  defined as the higher of either a the federal funds rate plus or b the prime rate 
the margin for the libor rate option is based on our ratio of funded indebtedness to ebitda  as each is defined in the loan agreement  and may range from to 
the libor interest rate option may be selected for periods of to months  months or months 
we have fixed the interest rate on million of the credit facility borrowings with an interest rate swap agreement that extends through may as of january   there was million of outstanding debt under our credit facility secured by a first lien on all equipment  inventory and accounts receivable  and certain real estate 
of this amount  million bore interest at a fixed rate of pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement plus the libor margin under the credit facility  which was as of january  of the remaining debt  million bore interest at under libor contracts  plus a margin as of january   and million bore interest at  the prime rate as of january  furthermore  we had million outstanding in irrevocable letters of credit as of january   which reduced the amount available to borrow under the line of credit to million 
these letters of credit are primarily issued to insurance carriers to secure our ability to pay our self insured workers compensation liabilities 
they automatically renew annually and may be amended from time to time based on collateral requirements of the carriers 
we pay a fee on the outstanding letters of credit and unused funds based on the ratio of funded indebtedness to ebitda as the terms are defined in the credit facility 
as of january   the fee on the outstanding letters of credit and unused funds was and  respectively 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under our loan agreement 
the covenants require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges as defined in the loan documents of no less than to  increasing to to effective october   and a ratio of funded indebtedness to ebitda of no more than to  decreasing to to effective january  we are also required to maintain a consolidated net worth of million plus an aggregate amount equal to of quarterly net income beginning with the fourth quarter fiscal with no reductions for net losses  and an asset coverage ratio of no less than to an amendment to the loan agreement was executed on july   that modified certain definitions related to the financial covenants 
as of january   we were in compliance with all loan covenants 
on april   an amendment to the loan agreement was executed to reduce the revolving credit facility from million to million and to change our loan covenant requirement for funded indebtedness to ebitda from a maximum ratio of no more than to to to in addition  the margin for the libor interest rate option under the loan agreement was modified by the amendment and now may range from to 
the provisions of the amendment were effective as of april  as of january   we had approximately million of loans outstanding against million cash value of company owned life insurance policies 
the loans bore interest at a fixed rate of or variable rates ranging from to 
of the total loan amount outstanding as of january   approximately million is considered a current liability and presented as such in our consolidated balance sheet as of that date 
these life insurance policies were purchased by us on the lives of a number of officers and directors  both past and present 
we pay the premium and own the policy and carry the policy on our consolidated balance sheet at the cash value of the policy  net of any loans outstanding which we do not expect to repay prior to the death of the covered individual 
upon the death of any of the covered individuals  we receive the designated death benefit on the policy and may realize a gain to the extent that the death benefit exceeds the cash va lue 
the proceeds upon surrender of the policy would be reduced by the amount of any loans outstanding  unless repaid by us prior to that time 
redeeming such policies prior to death would trigger an income tax liability  therefore  we choose to borrow against the cash value versus redeeming such policies 
management believes that our financial condition  operating cash flow and available sources of external funds are sufficient to satisfy our requirements for debt service  capital expenditures  dividends and working capital over the course of the next months 
however  if we pursue a large acquisition or are unable to achieve our forecasted operating results during the next twelve months  our forecasted cash flows could be negatively impacted requiring that we consider alternative funding sources in order to avoid violations of our loan covenants 
contractual obligations future payments due under contractual obligations  aggregated by type of obligation  as of january   are as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest   capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases    purchase obligations linen contracts   natural gas contracts   deferred compensation and pension liabilities  total    critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on a continuing basis  including those related to linens in service  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets  discontinued operations  bad debts  property and equipment  derivative financial instruments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we discuss below the more significant accounting policies  estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may dif fer from these estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the consolidated financial statements 
linens in service linens in service represent the unamortized cost of textile and linen products purchased for service to customers 
we review our policy for amortizing linens in service on an ongoing basis 
in order to satisfy our initiative to provide customers with order fill rates we purchased a significant amount of additional linens in fiscal  which results in linens being washed less often and therefore lasting longer 
as a result  we determined that the actual useful life of our linens was longer than the estimated useful life previously used for amortization purposes in our financial statements and  effective april   the first day of our second fiscal quarter  changed the estimate of the average useful life from weeks to weeks to reflect the estimated period during which these linens will remain in service 
specific physical identification and inventory of linens in service is impractical in our business due to the fact that the inventory is ci rculating between our facilities and our customers facilities  however  available industry data supports the reasonableness of a week useful life 
furthermore  our amortization policy has produced historical levels of linens in service that are comparable as a percent of textile service rental revenues 
the effect of the change in useful life was to reduce fiscal linen amortization expense by million  increase fiscal net income by million  increase fiscal basic income per share by  and increase fiscal diluted income per share by 
we believe our amortization policy is appropriate for the valuation of linens in service 
self insurance liabilities we self insure liabilities for non union employee medical coverage and liabilities for casualty insurance claims  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  up to certain levels 
we purchase insurance coverage for large claims over the self insured retention levels 
in fiscal  we sold all casualty claims occurring prior to february   to an insurance company 
we maintain the liability for casualty claims that have occurred since february   and these amounts are set forth on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  self insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial methods and historical data for payment patterns  cost trends and other relevant factors 
while we believe that the estimated liabilities of million and million recorded for casualty and employee medical claims  respectively  as of january   are adequate  and that appropriate judgment has been applied in determin ing the estimates  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from actual liabilities resulting from the ultimate disposition of the claims 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
balances in the deferred income tax accounts are regularly reviewed for adequacy and recoverability by analyzing the expected income necessary to realize the deferred assets  the anticipated tax rates applicable when the deferred items are expected to be recognized and the ability to utilize carryforward items 
we believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods presented  and net deferred tax assets will be fully recovered  except for million of valuation allowance 
at january   we reported an aggregate of million in federal net operating loss and credit carryforward and various state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we do not provide for deferred tax liabilities related to the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance policies under the assumption that these policies will be held by us until death of the insured 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we believe certain positions could be challenged by tax authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance or a partial adjustment 
significant judgment is required in the evaluation of our reserves 
our reserves are regularly reviewed for adequacy and adjusted based on changing circumstances and the progress of tax audits 
in fiscal we recognized a million adjustment in these reserves which resulted in a reduction in our tax expense 
in fiscal we recorded an increase in the reserve of million related to our discontinued operations 
in fiscal we recognized a million adjustment resulting in a reduction to tax expense 
tax issues of approximately million that have been reserved are expected to be resolved in fiscal share based payment we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected option life and expected stock price volatility 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited before vesting 
the original estimate of the grant date fair value is not subsequently revised unless the awards are modified  but the estimate of expected forfeitures is evaluated throughout the vesting period and revised accordingly  with any necessary adjustments being recognized to cumulative stock based c ompensation cost 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
more information about share based payment and our related estimates is included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item a of this form k 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we consider the possible impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indications of possible impairment include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
to determine the potential impairment of long lived assets  we are required to make estimates of the projected future cash flows associated with the use of the assets  as well as their fair values 
we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets as of january  are fully recoverable 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill recorded as of june  was no longer amortized effective in fiscal instead  goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value based analysis at least annually as of the end of the third quarter 
derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow fluctuations related to changes in both interest rates and the price of natural gas 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  we have elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting for our interest rate swap agreement and for a portion of our natural gas futures contracts  where contract terms match and a perfect hedge is determined to exist 
for these cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are measured quarterly and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the natural gas futures contracts that are not considered a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes  the quarterly change in fair value of the derivatives is reported as non operating income or expense 
we believe the use of hedge accounting for our derivative contracts  where matched terms exist  provides the best accounting alternative for determining our quarterly and annual financial results 
pension benefits defined benefit plan expense and related obligations are calculated using actuarial models and are dependent on assumptions such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and rate of compensation increase

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts a nd circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption
