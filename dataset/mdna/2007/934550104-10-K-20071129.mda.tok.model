table of contents use of oibda we evaluate our operating performance based on several factors  including our primary financial measure of operating income loss before non cash depreciation of tangible assets  non cash amortization of intangible assets and non cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets which we refer to as oibda 
we consider oibda to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses  including the ability to provide cash flows to service debt 
however  a limitation of the use of oibda as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
accordingly  oibda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  operating income loss  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us gaap 
overview we are one of the world s major music content companies 
we classify our business interests into two fundamental operations recorded music and music publishing 
a brief description of each of those operations is presented below 
recorded music operations our recorded music business consists of the discovery and development of artists and the related marketing  distribution and licensing of recorded music produced by such artists 
in addition to the more traditional methods of discovering and developing artists  we established ilg to discover artists earlier in their careers and at a lower cost by leveraging our independent distribution network 
in the us  our recorded music operations are conducted principally through our major record labels warner bros 
records and the atlantic records group 
our recorded music operations also include rhino  a division that specializes in marketing our music catalog through compilations and reissuances of previously released music and video titles  as well as in the licensing of recordings to and from third parties for various uses  including film and television soundtracks 
on may   the company completed the acquisition of ryko  a leading independent  integrated music and entertainment company 
in january   the company acquired a majority interest in roadrunner  which includes roadrunner records  one of the leading hard rock and heavy metal labels 
outside the us  our recorded music activities are conducted in more than countries through wmi and its various subsidiaries  affiliates and non affiliated licensees 
wmi engages in the same activities as our us labels discovering and signing artists and distributing  marketing and selling their recorded music 
in most cases  wmi also markets and distributes the records of those artists for whom our domestic record labels have international rights 
in certain smaller countries  wmi licenses to unaffiliated third party record labels the right to distribute its records 
our recorded music distribution operations include wea corp  which markets and sells music and dvd products to retailers and wholesale distributors in the us  ada  which distributes the products of independent labels to retail and wholesale distributors in the us  ryko distribution  which distributes music and dvd releases from rykodisc  ryko s record music label  and third party record and video labels  various distribution centers and ventures operated internationally  an interest in word entertainment  which specializes in the distribution of music products in the christian retail marketplace  and the ada uk  which provides ada s distribution services to independent labels in the uk 
table of contents our principal recorded music revenue sources are sales of cds  digital downloads  mobile phone ringtones and other recorded music products and license fees received for the ancillary uses of our recorded music catalog 
the principal costs associated with our recorded music operations are as follows royalty costs and artist and repertoire costs the costs associated with i paying royalties to artists  producers  songwriters  other copyright holders and trade unions  ii signing and developing artists  iii creating master recordings in the studio and iv creating artwork for album covers and liner notes  product costs the costs to manufacture  package and distribute product to wholesale and retail distribution outlets  selling and marketing costs the costs associated with the promotion and marketing of artists and recorded music products  including costs to produce music videos for promotional purposes and artist tour support  and general and administrative costs the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative costs 
music publishing operations where recorded music is focused on exploiting a particular recording of a song  music publishing is an intellectual property business focused on the exploitation of the song itself 
in return for promoting  placing  marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter  or engaging in those activities for other rights holders  our music publishing business garners a share of the revenues generated from use of the song 
our music publishing operations include warner chappell  our global music publishing company headquartered in los angeles with operations in over countries through various subsidiaries  affiliates and non affiliated licensees 
we own or control rights to more than one million musical compositions  including numerous pop hits  american standards  folk songs and motion picture and theatrical compositions 
assembled over decades  our award winning catalog includes over  songwriters and composers and a diverse range of genres including pop  rock  jazz  country  r b  hip hop  rap  reggae  latin  folk  blues  symphonic  soul  broadway  techno  alternative  gospel and other christian music 
warner chappell also administers the music and soundtracks of several third party television and film producers and studios  including lucasfilm  ltd 
and hallmark entertainment 
warner chappell also previously owned wbp  which printed and distributed a broad selection of sheet music  books and educational materials  orchestrations  folios  personality books and arrangements from the catalogs of warner chappell and other music publishers 
on may   we sold our printed sheet music business to alfred publishing 
publishing revenues are derived from four main sources mechanical the licensor receives royalties with respect to compositions embodied in recordings sold in any format or configuration  including physical recordings eg  cds  dvds  video cassettes  online and wireless downloads and mobile phone ringtones 
performance the licensor receives royalties if the composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television  radio  cable and satellite  live performance at a concert or other venue eg  arena concerts  nightclubs  online and wireless streaming and performance of music in staged theatrical productions 
synchronization the licensor receives royalties or fees for the right to use the composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs  television commercials and videogames 
other the licensor receives royalties from other uses such as in toys or novelty items and for use in sheet music 

table of contents the principal costs associated with our music publishing operations are as follows artist and repertoire costs the costs associated with i signing and developing songwriters and ii paying royalties to songwriters  co publishers and other copyright holders in connection with income generated from the exploitation of their copyrighted works  and administration costs the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative costs 
factors affecting results of operations and financial condition market factors since  the recorded music industry has been unstable  which has adversely affected our operating results 
the industry wide decline can be attributed primarily to digital piracy 
other drivers of this decline are the bankruptcies of record retailers and wholesalers  growing competition for consumer discretionary spending and retail shelf space  and the maturation of the cd format  which has slowed the historical growth pattern of recorded music sales 
while cd sales still generate most of the recorded music revenues  cd sales continue to decline industry wide and we expect that trend to continue 
while new formats for selling recorded music product have been created  including the legal downloading of digital music using the internet  dvd audio formats and the distribution of music on mobile devices  significant revenue streams from these new markets are just beginning to emerge 
the recorded music industry performance may continue to negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  a declining recorded music industry could continue to have an adverse impact on the music publishing business 
this is because our music publishing business generates a significant portion of its revenues from mechanical royalties received from the sale of music in recorded music formats such as the cd 
realignment plan for fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company announced plans to implement changes intended to better align the company s workforce with the changing nature of the music industry 
these changes are part of the company s continued evolution from a traditional record and songs based business to a music based content company and its ongoing management of its cost structure 
the changes include a continued redeployment of resources to focus on new business initiatives to help the company diversify its revenue streams  including digital opportunities 
the realignment plan was also designed to improve the operating effectiveness and efficiency of our current businesses and to realign our management structure to  among other things  effectively address the continued development of digital distribution channels along with the decline of industry wide cd sales 
the company intends to enhance its effectiveness  flexibility  structure  and performance by reducing and realigning long term costs 
the realignment plan primarily consisted of the reorganization of management structures to more adequately and carefully address regional needs and new business requirements  to reduce organizational complexity and to improve leadership channels 
the company also continued to shift resources from our physical sales channels to efforts focused on digital distribution and emerging technologies and other new revenue streams 
part of the plan also resulted in the outsourcing of some back office functions as a cost savings measure 
the changes described above were implemented by the end of the fiscal year the company incurred all of the costs associated with the realignment plan in fiscal year approximately million of restructuring costs and million of implementation costs have been incurred since the realignment plan was implemented  and primarily all of these costs were paid in cash 
to implement such changes  the company reduced headcount by approximately employees 
the company expects the majority of any cost savings to be offset by new business initiatives such as digital distribution and video 

table of contents payments relating to executive compensation concurrent with our initial public offering  we determined that certain shares of restricted stock issued in and early may have been sold at prices below fair market value on the applicable date of sale and certain options to purchase shares of our stock granted may have had exercise prices below fair market value on the applicable date of grant 
as a result  certain us employee holders of the restricted stock who made elections under section b of the internal revenue code would be subject to additional ordinary income tax to the extent of the fair market value of the restricted stock received over the purchase price they paid for such stock 
in other cases  certain employees who did not make such an election will be subject to higher taxes on their restricted shares at the time of vesting than would have been the case had they purchased the shares for fair market value 
in addition  under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of signed into law in october   us employee option holders whose options vest with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant are subject to significant penalties under new section a of the internal revenue code 
irs notice provided transitional guidance on the application of section a which  among other things  permits options with exercise prices below the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant to be amended or replaced with new options having an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value on the grant date 
non us employee holders of restricted stock or options may be subject to similar or other related issues 
in order for us to address these issues our board of directors  based on a re assessment of fair market values on the applicable dates  approved the actions discussed below 
restricted stock 
we were authorized to pay a cash bonus to each employee who purchased restricted stock at prices that may have been below fair market value on the date of purchase 
the bonus was calculated as either an amount equal to the tax liability incurred by the employee at the grant date or an estimate of the additional tax which would be incurred by the employee upon vesting of the shares  depending upon the employee s section b election 
additionally  we paid the employees an amount necessary to pay the related taxes on the bonus 
this resulted in total cash payments of approximately million  which we expensed in the twelve months ended september  options 
we revised the exercise prices of certain options to purchase our common stock to prices equal to the applicable re determined fair market values of the common stock on the dates of the respective grants 
we compensated the grantees with a cash bonus representing the loss of value created by this adjustment to the option exercise prices 
this resulted in total cash bonuses paid of approximately million 
the revision of the exercise prices was treated as a modification of these awards and million related to this modification was expensed in the twelve months ended september  further  in connection with the million cash dividend we declared and paid to holders of our common stock  consisting of the investor group and certain members of management who held shares of common stock prior to the initial public offering  we made an adjustment to all options to purchase common stock outstanding at the time of declaration of the dividend 
the adjustment consisted of a cash make whole payment to each option holder equal to the pro rata amount that would have been received per share had all outstanding options been exercised at the time of the declaration of the dividend 
the amounts were adjusted down to reflect a present value discount based on the earliest possible exercise dates 
we recorded approximately million of expense related to such payments in the twelve months ended september  holdings refinancing and redemption in december  holdings issued million principal amount of debt 
the million principal amount of holdings debt consisted of i million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due the holdings floating rate notes  ii million principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due  which had an initial issuance discount of million the holdings discount notes and iii million principal amount of floating rate senior pik notes due the holdings pik notes  and collectively  the holdings notes 

table of contents in connection with the initial public offering  we used million of proceeds from the offering along with million of available cash to redeem the holdings floating rate notes  the holdings pik notes and of the holdings discount notes on june  in connection with the redemption  we were required to pay redemption premiums of million and million  respectively  which were paid on june  and recorded as a loss on the repayment of the notes in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  we also wrote off the remaining balance of debt issuance costs of million related to the notes redeemed and the remaining unamortized original issue discount of million related to the holdings pik notes 
such amounts  million in the aggregate  were recorded as a loss on the repayment of the notes in the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended september  see financial condition and liquidity for more information 
termination of management monitoring agreement as described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein  we entered into a management monitoring agreement the management agreement with the investor group in connection with the acquisition 
under the management agreement  we were required to pay the investor group an aggregate annual fee of million per year the periodic fees in consideration for ongoing consulting and management advisory services 
the investor group terminated the management agreement on may  and on may   we paid the investor group a million termination fee which was reflected in our statement of operations for the twelve months ended september  as a result  certain fees paid in prior periods do not appear in subsequent periods 
we paid million of periodic fees under the management agreement during the twelve months ended september  we no longer pay any periodic fees following the termination of the agreement 
sale of warner bros 
publications in may  we sold wbp  which conducted our sheet music operations  to alfred publishing 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction  as the historical book basis of the net assets being sold was adjusted to fair value in connection with the accounting for the acquisition

lava records restructuring the co chairman of the atlantic records group left our employ in august and we acquired the remaining interest of the lava records joint venture

initial common stock offering in may  we completed an initial public offering the initial common stock offering 
prior to the consummation of the initial common stock offering  we  among other things  renamed all of our outstanding shares of class a common stock as common stock and authorized an approximately  for split of our common stock 
we contributed the net proceeds from the initial common stock offering of million to holdings as an equity capital contribution 
holdings used all of such funds and approximately million of cash received through dividends from acquisition corp

on december   march   june  and september  we declared dividends on our outstanding common stock at a rate of per share 
the dividends were paid on february   april   july  and october   respectively  except for the portion of the dividends with respect to unvested restricted stock  which will be paid at such time as such shares become vested 
during the year ended september    shares of restricted stock purchased by or awarded to certain employees of the company vested  and employees of the company exercised  stock options 
covenant compliance our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain certain covenants including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  as such terms are defined in the credit facility  and has a maximum annual capital expenditures limitation 
the credit facility also contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional debt 
the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility could result in all amounts outstanding under the facility to be immediately due and payable  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
as of september   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 

table of contents our borrowing arrangements  including the holdings notes and the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes contain certain financial covenants  which limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures governing the notes to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends  make certain investments  sell certain assets  and consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all  or some of  our assets 
in order for acquisition corp 
and holdings corp 
to incur additional debt or make certain restricted payments using certain exceptions provided for in the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes and the holdings notes  the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in such indentures  must exceed a to ratio 
fixed charges are defined in such indentures as consolidated interest expense excluding certain non cash interest expense 
the terms of the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes and holdings discount notes significantly restrict acquisition corp  holdings and other subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us 
for example  the ability of acquisition corp 
and holdings to make such payments is governed by a formula based on of each of their consolidated net income which  as defined in the indentures governing such notes  excludes goodwill impairment charges and any after tax extraordinary  unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses accruing from june  and july   respectively 
in addition  as a condition to making such payments to us based on such formula  acquisition corp 
and holdings must each have an adjusted ebitda to interest expense ratio of at least to after giving effect to any such payments 
acquisition corp 
may also make a restricted payment prior to april  if  immediately after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment and any indebtedness incurred to finance such restricted payment  its net indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio would not exceed to and its net senior indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio would not exceed to in addition  holdings may make a restricted payment if  immediately after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment and any indebtedness incurred to finance such restricted payment  its net indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio would not exceed to notwithstanding such restrictions  the indentures permit an aggregate of million and million of such payments to be made by acquisition corp 
and holdings  respectively  whether or not there is availability under the formula or the conditions to its use are met 
acquisition corp 
s senior secured credit facility permits acquisition corp 
to make additional restricted payments to holdings  the proceeds of which may be utilized by holdings to make additional restricted payments  in an aggregate amount not to exceed million such amount subject to increase to million if the leverage ratio as of the last day of the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters was less than to and to million if the leverage ratio as of the last day of the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters was less than to  and subject to further increase in an amount equal to of cumulative excess cash flow that is not otherwise applied pursuant to acquisition corp 
s senior secured credit facility  and  in addition  permits acquisition corp 
to make restricted payments to holdings  the proceeds of which may be utilized by holdings to make additional restricted payments not to exceed million in any fiscal year  provided that the proceeds of such restricted payments shall be applied solely to pay cash dividends on the company s common stock 
furthermore  holdings subsidiaries will be permitted under the terms of acquisition corp 
s existing senior secured credit facility  as it may be amended  and under other indebtedness  to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to holdings 
acquisition corp 
and holdings may make additional restricted payments using certain other exceptions provided for in the indentures governing the acquisition corp

summary management believes that future funds generated from our operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements and payment of regular dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
however  our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors  as well as other industry specific factors such as the ability to control music piracy 

table of contents contractual and other obligations firm commitments the following table summarizes the company s aggregate contractual obligations at september   and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we expect to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and availability under the million revolving credit portion of the senior secured credit facility

subordinated notes and the holdings notes 
these obligations have been presented based on the principal amounts due  current and long term as of september  amounts do not include any fair value adjustments  bond premiums  discounts or interest payments 
the interest expense obligations do not include interest expense related to our variable rate debt 
see note to the audited financial statements for a description of our financing arrangements 
holding notes payments include cash interest payments of million for the year ending september   million for each year ending september     and million for the year ending september  as well as principal payments of million in the year ending september  operating lease obligations primarily relate to the minimum lease rental obligations for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world 
these obligations have been presented with the benefit of million of sublease income expected to be received under non cancelable agreements 
the future minimum payments reflect the amounts owed under our lease arrangements and do not include any fair market value adjustments that may have been recorded as a result of the acquisition 
we enter into long term commitments with artists  songwriters and co publishers for the future delivery of music product 
aggregate firm commitments to such talent approximated million across hundreds of artists  songwriters  publishers  songs and albums at september  such commitments  which are unpaid advances across multiple albums and songs  are payable principally over a ten year period  generally upon delivery of albums from the artists or future musical compositions by songwriters and co publishers 
because the timing of payment  and even whether payment occurs  is dependent upon the timing of delivery of albums and musical compositions from talent  the timing and amount of payment of these commitments as presented in the above summary can vary significantly 
we have minimum funding commitments and other related obligations to support the operations of various investments 

table of contents market risk management we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in market rates and prices  including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have significant transactional exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar due to the global scope of our operations 
for the twelve months ended september   approximately billion  or  of our revenues were generated outside of the us the top five revenue producing international countries are the uk  japan  france  germany and italy  which use the british pound sterling  japanese yen and euro as currencies  respectively 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for information on our operations in different geographical areas 
historically  we have used and continue to use foreign exchange contracts  primarily to hedge the risk that unremitted or future royalties and license fees owed to our domestic companies for the sale  or anticipated sale  of us copyrighted products abroad may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge foreign currency risk associated with financing transactions such as third party and inter company debt 
we focus on managing the level of exposure to the risk of foreign current exchange rate fluctuations on our major currencies  which include the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  canadian dollar  mexican peso  swedish krona  and australian dollar 
additionally  prior to the closing of the acquisition  old wmg and time warner used foreign exchange contracts to manage this risk 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional information 
the company also is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its million principal amount of sterling denominated notes that were issued in april these sterling notes mature on april  as of september   these sterling notes had a carrying value of million 
based on the principal amount of sterling denominated notes outstanding as of september  and assuming that all other market variables are held constant including the level of interest rates  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling would not have an impact on the fair value of these sterling notes  since these notes are completely hedged as of september  interest rate risk we had billion of total debt outstanding as of september   of which billion was variable rate debt 
as such  we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
in order to manage this exposure  and consistent with the requirement under our senior secured credit facility to maintain a fixed to floating debt ratio of at least of our actual funded debt though at least april  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge notional debt amounts of million in and million in during the twelve months ended september   we did not enter into any additional interest rate swap or swap extension agreements 
during  we entered into million of interest rate swap agreements to extend the maturities of our existing interest rate swap portfolio 
the total notional amount of debt hedged at september  and was million 
under our interest rate swap agreements  we agreed to receive floating rate payments based on three month libor rates in exchange for fixed rate payments 
based on the amount of our floating rate debt and our interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of september   each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately million 
this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floating rate debt remains constant with an immediate across the board increase or decrease as of september  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the 
table of contents period 
this increase or decrease in rates would partially be mitigated by an increase or decrease in interest income earned on the company s cash balances  almost all of which are invested in short term variable interest rate earning assets 
in addition to our billion of variable rate debt  we had approximately million of fixed rate debt outstanding at september  based on the level of interest rates prevailing at september   the fair value of this fixed rate debt was approximately million 
further  based on the amount of our fixed rate debt and our related million of interest rate swap agreements noted above that were outstanding at september   a basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of fixed rate debt remains constant with an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no subsequent changes in rates for the remainder of the period 
we monitor our positions with  and the credit quality of  the financial institutions that are party to any of our financial transactions 
credit risk relating to the interest rate swaps is considered low because the swaps are entered into with strong  credit worthy counterparties  and the credit risk is confined to the net settlement of the interest over the remaining life of the swaps 
critical accounting policies the sec s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in our application 
we believe the following list represents the critical accounting policies of us as contemplated by frr for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein 
purchase accounting we account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
in addition  reserves have been established on our balance sheet related to acquired liabilities and qualifying restructuring costs based on assumptions made at the time of acquisition 
we evaluate these reserves on a regular basis to determine the adequacy or accuracy of the amounts estimated 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of accountings standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under fas the company no longer amortizes goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life 
fas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis and when events occur that may suggest that the fair value of such assets cannot support the carrying value 
goodwill impairment is tested using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of 
table of contents the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available and  if deemed necessary  we obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  if any 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and analysis of recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
we test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter each fiscal year 
we tested our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter of and noted that no impairment occurred 
as of september   warner music group has recorded goodwill in the amount of billion  primarily related to the acquisition 
see note to our audited financial statements included herein for a further discussion of warner music group s goodwill 
equity method and cost method investments for non publicly traded investments  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals  as appropriate 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and unstable markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the valuation methodologies discussed above and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we consider our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments  therefore  we generally complete our assessments with a long term viewpoint 
if the fair value of any of our equity method or cost method investments is less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
management s assessments of fair value in accordance with these valuation methodologies represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with our internal planning 
if different fair values were estimated  this could have a material impact on the financial statements 

table of contents revenue and cost recognition sales returns and uncollectible accounts in accordance with practice in the recorded music industry and as customary in many territories  certain products such as compact discs and cassettes are sold to customers with the right to return unsold items 
under statement of accounting standards no 
 revenue when right of return exists  revenues from such sales are recognized when the products are shipped based on gross sales less a provision for future estimated returns 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and commercial acceptance of our products 
based on this information  management reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales to provide for the estimated customer returns 
similarly  management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers  and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percent that has historically been uncollected by aged category 
based on this information  management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible 
based on management s analysis of sales returns and uncollectible accounts  reserves totaling million and million have been established at september  and september   respectively 
comparability of gross dollar value of reserves is affected by the inherent seasonality in the music business 
that is  the recorded music business historically has generated approximately of its sales in the last three months of the calendar year due to increased consumer demand associated with the holiday season 
as such  both gross receivables and related allowances would be at a naturally lower level at september  the end of our fiscal year  and at a naturally higher level at december  the end of our first fiscal quarter 
the ratios of our receivable allowances to gross accounts receivables were approximately at the end of september  and september  gross versus net revenue classification in the normal course of business  we act as an intermediary or agent with respect to certain payments received from third parties 
for example  we distribute music product on behalf of third party record labels 
the accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the ultimate customer or on the net amount received from the customer after participation and other royalties paid to third parties 
to the extent revenues are recorded gross in the full amount billed  any participations and royalties paid to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount gross revenues  less expenses flows through operating income 
accordingly  the impact on operating income is the same  whether we record the revenue on a gross basis or net basis less related participations and royalties 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal in a transaction or acting as an agent in the transaction 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received on a gross basis 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received less participations and royalties paid to third parties  ie  on a net basis 
the determination of whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and based on an evaluation of the terms of an arrangement 

table of contents in determining whether we serve as principal or agent in these arrangements  we follow the guidance in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
pursuant to such guidance  we serve as the principal in transactions where we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership 
the indicators that we have substantial risks and rewards of ownership are as follows we are the supplier of the products or services to the customer  we have general inventory risk for a product before it is sold  we have latitude in establishing prices  we have the contractual relationship with the ultimate customer  we modify and service the product purchased to meet the ultimate customer specifications  we have discretion in supplier selection  and we have credit risk 
conversely  pursuant to eitf  we serve as agent in arrangements where we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership 
the indicators that we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership are as follows the supplier not warner music group is responsible for providing the product or service to the customer  the supplier not warner music group has latitude in establishing prices  the amount we earn is fixed  and the supplier not warner music group has credit risk 
based on the above criteria and for the more significant transactions that we have evaluated  we record the distribution of product on behalf of third party record labels on a gross basis  subject to the terms of the contract 
however  recorded music compilations distributed by other record companies where we have a right to participate in the profits are recorded on a net basis 
accounting for royalty advances we regularly commit to and pay advance royalties to our artists and songwriters in respect of future sales 
we account for these advance royalty payments under the related guidance in statement of financial accounting standard no 
 financial reporting in the record and music industry fas 
under fas  we capitalize as assets certain advance royalty payments that management believes are recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the artist or songwriter 
management s decision to capitalize an advance to an artist or songwriter as an asset requires significant judgment as to the recoverability of these advances 
the recoverability of these assets is assessed upon initial commitment of the advance  based upon management s forecast of anticipated revenues from the sale of future and existing music and publishing related products 
in determining whether these amounts are recoverable  management evaluates the current and past popularity of the artist or songwriter  the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product  the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to  and other relevant factors 
based upon this information  management expenses the portion of such advances that it believes is not recoverable 
in many cases  royalty advance payments to artists or publishers without history of successful commercial acceptability of the product and evidence of current or past popularity will be expensed immediately 
all advances are assessed for recoverability continuously and at minimum on a quarterly basis 

table of contents we had million and million of advances on our balance sheet as of september  and  respectively 
we believe such advances are recoverable through future royalties to be earned by the related artists and songwriters 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation issued to employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas  which amends statement of financial accounting standard fasb statement no 
 share based payment  fas 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we adopted the expense recognition provision of fas as of march   the date of the acquisition  and record stock based compensation expense for grants on and after that date as provided by fas  and will continue to provide pro forma information for all previous periods in the notes to financial statements to provide results as if fas had been adopted in those years 
effective october   we adopted fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  fas r which revises fas  using the modified prospective method 
there was no impact to our results of operations or financial position as a result of the adoption of fas r 
under this provision  we estimate the fair value of our stock based awards on the grant date and expense the fair value over the service period 
as disclosed in the notes to financial statements  we previously estimated the fair value of options issued at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  which includes assumptions related to volatility  expected life  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
in january of we determined that a binomial method was a more accurate and appropriate method for determining fair value 
we have estimated the fair value of our grants made subsequent to january using the binomial method  which includes assumptions related to volatility  expected life  dividend yield and risk factors 
we also award or sell restricted shares to our employees 
for restricted shares awarded or sold below market value  the accounting charge is measured at the grant date and amortized ratably as non cash compensation over the vesting term 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence  establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered 
we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence to consider a valuation allowance under the provisions of fas as a result  we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance 
the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established 
the valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
an ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance if such valuation allowances were not established through goodwill at the time of the acquisition 
the establishment and reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings 

table of contents tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of probable outcomes 
cash flow presentation in our consolidated statement of cash flows  we report repayments of principal amounts borrowed under our debt instruments as cash used in financing activities 
this includes repayments of amounts due with respect to the redemption of our pik notes in  a portion of which was used to satisfy obligations for accrued interest that was deferred to be paid as additional principal 
pursuant to this policy  accrued interest of million in related to the repayment of our holdings pik notes and holdings discount notes is included in cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we classify interest paid as originally scheduled in our borrowing arrangements as operating cash outflows and interest deferred and subsequently paid as additional principal as financing cash outflows 
there is diversity in practice  as some other companies present all interest payments  whether deferred or not  as operating cash flows 
in this respect  our cumulative operating cash flows may not be comparable to other companies that differ from us only in respect to the repayment terms of their borrowings 
if the company were to alternatively present this amount as cash paid for operating activities rather than cash paid in financing activities  cash flows from operating activities would have decreased by million for the year ended september  new accounting principles in addition to the critical accounting policies discussed above  we adopted several new accounting policies during the past two years 
none of these new accounting principles had a material affect on our audited financial statements 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for a more complete summary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended september   the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in market rates and prices  including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
as of september   other than as described below  there have been no material changes to the company s exposure to market risk since september  we have transactional exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar due to the global scope of our operations 
we use foreign exchange contracts  primarily to hedge the risk that unremitted or future royalties and license fees owed to our domestic companies for the sale  or anticipated sale  of us copyrighted products abroad may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we focus on managing the level of exposure to the risk of foreign current exchange rate fluctuations on our major currencies  which include the british pound sterling  euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  mexican peso  swedish krona and australian dollar 
during the twelve months ended september   the company entered into foreign exchange hedge contracts and  as of september   the company has outstanding hedge contracts for the sale of million and the purchase of million of foreign currencies at fixed rates 
as of november   the company had not entered into any significant foreign exchange contracts subsequent to september  the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the purpose of assessing the specific risks  we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments 
for foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at september   assuming a hypothetical depreciation of the u 
s dollar against foreign currencies from prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and assuming no change in interest rates  the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would have decreased by million 
because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying transactions 

table of contents we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our million principal amount of sterling denominated notes that were issued in april these sterling notes mature on april  as of september   these sterling notes had a fair value and carrying value of approximately million 
based on the principal amount of sterling denominated notes outstanding as of september  and assuming that all other market variables are held constant including the level of interest rates  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling would not have an impact on the fair value of these sterling notes  since these notes are completely hedged as of september  we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our floating rate debt 
based on the amount of our floating rate debt and our interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of september   each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately million 
this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floating rate debt remains constant with an immediate across the board increase or decrease as of september  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 
this increase or decrease in rates would partially be mitigated by an increase or decrease in interest income earned on our cash balances  almost all of which are invested in short term variable interest rate earning assets 
during the twelve months ended september   the company did not enter into any interest rate addition swaps or swap extensions 
the total notional amount of debt hedged as of september  was million 
as of november   the company had not entered into any additional interest rate swap agreements subsequent to september  we monitor our positions with  and the credit quality of  the financial institutions that are party to any of our financial transactions 
credit risk relating to the interest rate swaps is considered low because the swaps are entered into with strong  credit worthy counterparties  and the credit risk is confined to the net settlement of the interest over the remaining life of the swaps
