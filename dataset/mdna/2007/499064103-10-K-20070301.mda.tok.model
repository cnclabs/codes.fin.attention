introduction business overview we are primarily a truckload carrier with headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for customers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on a short to medium length of haul 
we provide regional truckload carrier services from our regional dry van and temperature controlled service centers  as well as brokerage services from our regional brokerage service centers 
the results of our brokerage activities were relatively immaterial for and therefore a detailed discussion of the financial results of these operations will not be separately presented 
at december   we operated dry van service centers  three temperature controlled service centers  and four brokerage service centers 
in early  we added both a refrigerated and a brokerage service center in memphis  tennessee 
over the past five years we have achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
during this period  our revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in  and our net income grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable freight lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus almost exclusively on operating in distinct geographic and shipping markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas and higher equipment utilization in dense freight lanes 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating a modern equipment fleet  maintaining a high driver to non driver employee ratio  and regulating vehicle speed 
providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service  in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 
using technology to enhance our business 
our tractors are equipped with a satellite based tracking and communications system to permit us to stay in contact with our drivers  obtain load position updates  and provide our customers with freight visibility 
the majority of our trailers are equipped with tracking technology to allow us to more effectively manage our trailers  maintain a low trailer to tractor ratio  efficiently assess detention fees  and minimize cargo loss 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open and develop new regional service centers in selected geographic areas and operate them at or near our targeted margins within a relatively short period of time 
during  we opened seven new service centers four dry van  two brokerage  and one temperature controlled 
our revenue growth was also fueled by the purchase of most of the trucking assets of roads west transportation  inc roads west in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
the main factors that impact our profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and service centers and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition for the year ended december   our results of operations improved as follows versus the fiscal year revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  net income increased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share increased to from 
our average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge increased  to in from in  while our average miles per tractor decreased  to  from  the decrease in utilization led to a reduction in average revenue per tractor per week  to  in from  in the utilization decrease is attributed to a less robust freight environment  more stringent hours of service regulations  and a shortened length of haul 
we also experienced an increase in the percentage of non revenue miles  to in from in during  we grew our fleet by tractors  and we periodically experienced temporary challenges attracting a sufficient number of drivers to optimize utilization of our expanding tractor fleet 
in response to this challenge  we placed additional emphasis on our driver recruiting and retention efforts 
this emphasis on recruiting and retention  combined with increases in driver compensation in totaling two cents per mile  resulted in nearly all of our trucks being fully seated at year end at december   our balance sheet reflected million in cash and cash equivalents  no debt  and shareholders equity of million 
for the year  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for net capital expenditures 
our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
we had tractors under operating leases at december  future operating lease commitments as of december  was approximately million 
trends and outlook going forward  we intend to continue to grow our de centralized service center model 
during  we have already opened refrigerated and brokerage service centers in memphis  tennessee  and we expect to open several more service centers of various types 
we also plan to continue to evaluate the market for acquisition opportunities that make sense within our disciplined operating framework 
our base expectation for the medium to longer term is to grow our fleet between and annually  while continuing to grow our brokerage business 
we will evaluate this base expectation and may adjust it up or down periodically based on factors such as freight demand  driver availability  and acquisitions 
historically  excess capacity in the transportation industry had limited our ability to improve rates 
however  beginning in and continuing through  the united states economy experienced growth  which  together with tighter truckload capacity  contributed to higher freight rates throughout much of the industry  including a improvement in our average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge from to in the second half of  the demand and pricing environment softened 
although we believe the medium to longer term outlook for achieving pricing increases remains favorable  the timing and consistency of achieving pricing increases will be subject to economic and competitive forces over which we have little control 

table of contents over the past three years  we have experienced substantial cost increases  particularly those related to equipment prices and depreciation  driver and owner operator compensation  fuel  and insurance 
we expect our costs to continue to increase  but at a slower rate than over the past three years 
based on the foregoing  including our assumptions concerning freight tonnage  freight rates  and expenses  we believe the environment in will be more difficult for achieving the revenue and earnings growth rates we have achieved for the past three years 
nevertheless  we believe we remain well positioned to continue to execute our strategy for achieving industry leading growth and profitability 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
total revenue revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits fuel fuel operations and maintenance operations and maintenance insurance and claims insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses communications communications depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization lease expense revenue equipment lease expense revenue equipment purchased transportation purchased transportation miscellaneous operating expenses miscellaneous operating expenses total operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations income from operations net interest and other income expense net interest and other income expense income before income taxes income before income taxes income taxes income taxes net income net income gross fuel expense without fuel surcharge 
net fuel expense including fuel surcharge 
a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the relatively high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  up from million in this increase is due to a combination of fleet expansion associated with the opening of four dry van and one refrigerated regional service centers  and our purchase of most of the trucking assets of roads west  as well as increased revenue per mile and the growth of our brokerage operations 
revenue generated from roads west accounted for approximately million of the total million increase 
as a result of the expansion  including the roads west acquisition  our tractor fleet grew to  tractors including owned by independent contractors for  up from  tractors in the growth in the fleet  along with a increase in average revenue per total mile  resulted in a significant period over period improvement in freight revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor  a increase in our percentage of non revenue miles  and a decrease in average revenue per tractor per week in compared to 
table of contents salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in the increase is due to the combination of driver pay rate increases implemented in  and a non cash equity based compensation expense of approximately million for  which expense was not recorded for years prior to for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
due to fewer injury claims in fiscal year  our workers compensation expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in this was mainly due to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which offset higher fuel prices 
we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to in  compared to in  as a result of higher fuel prices 
we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely affect our operating expenses throughout and that continued unrest in the middle east and other areas  in addition to hurricanes and other weather related events  also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
operations and maintenance expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the average age of our equipment and the increase in routine service and maintenance completed at our regional service centers 
the average age of our company tractors and trailers at the end of was years and years  respectively  compared to years and years  respectively  in in addition  increased revenue per mile also contributed to a reduction in operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for the decrease is due to better claims experience and lower claims costs in increased revenue per mile also improved this primarily mileage based expense as a percentage of revenue 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to for from for the decrease is mainly due to improved revenue per mile 
communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for this slight increase is due to the implementation of new equipment tracking devices  for which we incur monthly service fees 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in this slight increase is due to the growth in the percentage of our fleet that is owned by us as opposed to owned by independent contractors 
effective october   we increased the estimated salvage value of our tractors and trailers from to 
this decision was made during our routine  period review when we determined that the salvage values of our tractors and trailers was higher than originally expected 
this determination was further based upon i favorable market conditions in equipment sales  ii a guaranteed re purchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii a decrease in the average miles driven on the equipment being sold 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million for the fiscal year excluding the impact of this change in accounting estimate  depreciation expense for would have been of revenue before fuel surcharge 
this increase is due to the growth in the percentage of our fleet that is company owned  compared to our fleet that is operated by independent contractors 
lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to essentially zero for prior to the acquisition of edwards bros  inc in the third quarter of  we owned all of our revenue equipment and therefore did not incur lease expense for most of at year end we had tractors under operating leases 

table of contents purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for the increase in this category is primarily due to payments to outside carriers for transportation services arranged by our brokerage division  which began operations in the third quarter of excluding purchased transportation expense from our brokerage division  this expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  would have decreased to in  compared to for this decrease is attributed to a lower percentage of owner operator tractors being operated during as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for gains from sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to additional expenditures related to technology improvements  consulting and professional fees  and higher allowance for doubtful accounts 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest income as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for the average rate of return on our cash and short term investments increased more than basis points from to we had no outstanding debt at december  or other expense for was comprised of a  impairment charge relating to our investment in transportation resource partners trp 
other income for was comprised of  gains resulting from the sale of our investment in concentrek  inc concentrek  along with a  impairment charge relating to our investment in trp 
income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to hurricane tax credits  investment tax credits  and job creation and retention credits recognized in the decrease in the effective income tax rate was offset by an increase in income before tax  resulting in income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  of for both and as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  up from million in this increase is due to the combination of fleet expansion  improved revenue per mile  the opening of three additional dry van regional service centers  opening of a brokerage service center in july  and the acquisition of edwards bros 
in august revenue generated from edwards bros 
accounted for approximately of the total increase 
as a result of the expansion  our tractor fleet grew to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors 
the growth in the fleet  coupled with improved freight demand  and a increase in average revenue per tractor per week in over  resulted in the significant period over period improvement in freight revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor and a increase in our percentage of non revenue miles 

table of contents salaries  wages and benefits expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in the increase is primarily due to increases in driver pay rates implemented in  along with an increase in the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
amounts paid to independent contractors for hauling freight are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   an average of of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to an average of for the year ended december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  remained constant as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  at for both and this was mainly due to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which offset higher fuel prices 
we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to in  compared to in  as a result of higher fuel prices 
operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase is mainly due to an increase in the percentage of company owned tractors  which led to higher operating expenses 
the percentage of company owned tractors increased to an average of for  from in the average age of our revenue equipment at year end remained at years for both and insurance and claims expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for the decrease is due to better claims experience and lower claims costs in operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for from for the slight increase is primarily due to growth of our company fleet  which was mostly offset by improvements in average revenue per tractor in communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for both and depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is offset by a corresponding decrease in lease expense for revenue equipment and purchased transportation 
during the year  most of our company fleet was purchased for cash 
at december   we had tractors held under operating leases that were acquired through the edwards bros 
acquisition 
lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to less than for  compared to for this decrease is a result of the reduction in the number of tractors we held under operating leases  as discussed above 
the combination of depreciation and lease expense remained constant at for both and purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for compared to for the decrease is due to the combination of improvements in revenue per mile  along with the decrease in the percentage of our total fleet comprised of independent contractors 
as of december   of our total fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for gains from sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment were million for the year ended december   compared to zero for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in  from in the slight increase is mostly due to the combination of higher bad debt reserves recorded and higher facility repair and maintenance expense incurred as a result of owning additional service centers 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for 
table of contents net interest income expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained at less than for both and we had no outstanding debt at december  or other expense for was comprised of gains resulting from the sale of our investment in concentrek  along with a reduction in the carrying value of our investment in trp 
other expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to zero for income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for  primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes that was offset by a slight decrease in the effective income tax rate in as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  and to a lesser extent lease financing arrangements  issuances of equity securities  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase for is due to the combination of increased revenue and net income  the addition of non cash stock compensation expense  and proceeds from sale of our short term investments 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of equipment sales and trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we also spent approximately million relating to the acquisition of the roads west equipment 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately million for we expect these capital expenditures will be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately million for the year ended cash used in financing for the year ended december  consisted primarily of i million cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders  ii million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and iii million in tax benefits from stock based compensation 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of i million of debt payments associated with the acquisition of edwards bros  ii million cash dividends paid to common stock shareholders  and iii million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the large increase in cash dividends paid in compared to was due to a three for two stock split in december  which effectively increased aggregate dividends paid by 
in addition  the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of was paid on february   resulting in one additional distribution in at december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit 
in october  we raised our line of credit from million to million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit agreement and  except as described below  were in compliance with these covenants at december  and at december   our quick ratio the sum of unrestricted cash  unrestricted marketable securities  and net accounts receivable divided by the sum of current liabilities  the outstanding aggregate principal borrowed  and letters of credit outstanding was  which is slightly below the minimum requirement of stipulated in our line of credit agreement 
on february   our lender issued a letter waiving its rights with respect to any default resulting from our non compliance with the quick ratio at december  as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
in october we used cash to acquire most of the trucking assets of roads west  which accounted for most of the cash decrease between december  and december  management believes we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next twelve months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash flows from operations and borrowing available under our existing line of credit 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 

table of contents off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we had tractors held under operating leases with varying termination dates ranging from july to august future operating lease commitments as of december  were million  with  due in the next months 
the effective annual interest rates under these operating leases range from to 
lease payments with respect to such vehicles are reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to operating leases was million in  compared to million in tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses and other commitments 
payments in millions due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase obligations revenue equipment investment in transportation resource partners operating leases revenue equipment operating leases terminal building potential pay out relating to the roads west acquisition total our purchase commitments for revenue equipment are currently under negotiation 
upon execution of the purchase commitments  we anticipate that purchase commitments under contract will have a net purchase price of approximately million and will be paid throughout on october   we acquired most of the trucking assets of roads west transportation  inc the purchase agreement describes potential earn outs due at certain dates over the six month period after the closing date 
the potential pay out is contingent upon the outcome of retaining existing drivers and independent contractors  and maintaining revenue levels with existing customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts  and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements  is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
table of contents depreciation 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from three to years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used revenue equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
effective october   we increased the estimated salvage value of our tractors and trailers from to 
this decision was made during our routine  periodic review when we determined that the salvage value of our tractors and trailers was higher than originally expected 
this determination was further based upon i favorable market conditions in equipment sales  ii a guaranteed re purchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii a decrease in the average miles driven on the equipment being sold 
future changes in our useful lives or salvage value estimates  or fluctuation in market value that is not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect in our results of operations 
claims accrual 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves are adjusted quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim  historical trends  advice from third party administrators and insurers  the specific facts of individual cases  the jurisdictions involved  estimates of future claims development  and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  our profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention layers  we also must make judgments concerning our aggregate coverage limits 
if any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount 
our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management judgment also is required regarding a variety of other factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on our future performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
share based payments 
we have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant 

table of contents prior to january   we accounted for stock option awards granted under our compensation plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
share based employee compensation expense was not recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to january   as our stock options had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock on the date of the grant and therefore  no intrinsic value 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  our compensation expense recorded in includes both charges related to the vesting of options and restricted stock granted since the adoption of sfas no 
r as well as compensation cost related to the unvested portions of options granted prior to january  for all compensation cost recorded  fair value of the options was determined using the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we also are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
based upon our experience  we believe that we generally pass through to customers approximately to of fuel price increases 
for the fiscal year ended december   fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  represented of our total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  compared to for the same period ending in
