item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes  on our strategy for permanent reinvestment and concluded that any such repatriation would not have been tax efficient nor compatible with the company s business practices and plans 
the jobs act also provided for reform related to foreign shipping income 
this legislation favorably impacted us beginning january   with the majority of our foreign shipping income no longer subject to tax in the united states 
in  we reviewed our global operating structure and executed a worldwide restructuring to maximize potential growth and cash flow  as well as create a more favorable tax efficient corporate structure for the expansion of our business 
commitments and contingencies at december   we had long term operating leases for office space  automobiles  temporary residences  and office equipment

the highland rover is subject to a purchase option on the part of the charterer  pursuant to terms of an amendment to the original charter which was executed in late the option is subject to a notification period and agreement between the parties as to the purchase price based on certain factors 
the charterer has notified us of their intent to exercise the purchase option 
until the charterer exercises the option and the parties agree on both timing and the purchase price calculation  the timing of the closing of the sale  if any  cannot be determined

the aggregate notional value of these instruments was million and million at december  and  respectively 
all of these instruments have an expiration date within the next year 
in the past  no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments 
management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur from these instruments 
we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims may involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have not been specifically quantified but we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts for the expected loss 
other claims or liabilities  including those related to taxes in foreign jurisdictions  may be estimated based on our experience in these matters and  where appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of the uncertainties surrounding our estimates of contingent liabilities and future claims  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference  if any  between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle the liabilities 
in addition to estimates related to litigation and tax liabilities  other examples of liabilities requiring estimates of future exposure include contingencies arising out of acquisitions and divestitures 
our contingent liabilities are based on the most recent information available to us regarding the nature of the exposure 
such exposures change from period to period based upon updated relevant facts and circumstances  which can cause the estimate to change 
in the recent past  our estimates for contingent liabilities have been sufficient to cover the actual amount of our exposure
