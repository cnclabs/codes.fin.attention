item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

table of contents 
index to financial statements overview our business segments are oil water technologies  gas technologies and automation controls 
the oil water technologies group is our largest segment and consists of two product lines 
the first is our standard and traditional product line consisting of oil and gas separation and dehydration equipment sales and related services and an extensive north american branch distribution network 
the second product line includes built to order process systems  which are focused primarily on oil and water production and processing systems designed and built to meet customer specifications 
the gas technologies group includes our co membrane business  the assets and operating relationship related to gas processing facilities in west texas and hs removal technologies  including shell paques 
the automation controls group focuses on sales of new control panels and systems that monitor and control oil and gas production  as well as field service activities  including repair  maintenance  testing and inspection services for existing systems 
we allocate corporate and other expenses to each of the segments  rather than segregating these costs on a standalone basis 
certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal amounts in order to present these results on a comparable basis with amounts for fiscal and forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended each a forward looking statement 
the words believe  expect  plan  intend  designed to  estimate  project  will  could  may and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this document include  but are not limited to  discussions of accounting policies and estimates  indicated trends in the level of oil and gas exploration and production and the effect of such conditions on our results of operations see industry and business environment  growth plans for and beyond  future uses of and requirements for financial resources see liquidity and capital resources  impact of bookings on future revenues and anticipated backlog levels 
our expectations about our business outlook  customer spending  potential acquisitions  oil and gas prices and our business environment and that of the industry in general are only our expectations regarding these matters 
actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this report for reasons including  but not limited to market factors such as pricing and demand for petroleum related products  the level of petroleum industry exploration and production expenditures  the effects of competition  the availability of a skilled labor force  world economic conditions  the level of drilling activity  the legislative environment in the united states and other countries  energy policies of opec  conflict involving the united states or in major petroleum producing or consuming regions  acts of war or terrorism  technological advances that could lower overall finding and development costs  weather patterns and the overall condition of capital markets for countries in which we operate

risk factors and the other factors and risks discussed in this annual report on form k and in subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that may affect us and the outcomes related to our forward looking statements 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the results reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on our future expectations we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenues and related costs when products are shipped and services are rendered for time and materials and service contracts  manufactured goods produced in standard manufacturing operations and sold in the ordinary course of business through regular marketing channels and certain customized manufactured goods that are smaller jobs with less customization  making them similar to such standard manufactured goods that is  contracts valued at  or less having contract durations of four months or less 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method on contracts greater than  and having contract durations in excess of four months that represent customized  engineered orders of our products and qualify for such treatment in accordance with the requirements of aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of certain production type contracts sop 
in addition  we use the percentage of completion method on all automation controls segment equipment fabrication and sales projects that qualify for such treatment in accordance with the requirements of sop the automation controls segment sells customized products fabricated to order pursuant to a large number of smaller contracts with durations of two to three months  with occasional large systems projects of longer duration 
the segment does not produce standard units or maintain an inventory of products for sale 
due to the nature of the segment s equipment fabrication and sales operations  and the potential for wide variations in our results of operations that could occur from applying the as shipped methodology to smaller contracts for these customized  fabricated goods  this segment recognizes revenues  regardless of contract value or duration  applying the percentage of completion method 
in  approximately of total company revenues were recorded on an as shipped or as performed basis  and approximately were recorded using the percentage of completion method 
with respect to contract revenues recorded utilizing the percentage of completion method  earned revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date relate to total estimated costs of the project  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
total estimated contract cost is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect revenue and net income and it requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
total costs expected to be incurred  and therefore recognition of revenue  could be affected by various internal or external factors including  but not limited to changes in project scope change orders  changes in productivity  scheduling  the cost and availability of labor  the cost and availability of raw materials  the weather  client delays in providing approvals at benchmark stages of the project and the timing of deliveries from third party providers of key components 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known 
earned revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed claims and change order revenues  if applicable 
losses expected to be incurred on the jobs in progress  after consideration of estimated probable minimum recoveries from claims and change orders  are charged to income as soon as such losses are known 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
we generally recognize revenue and earnings to which the percentage of completion method applies over a period of two to six quarters 
in the event a project is terminated by our customer before completion  our customer is liable for costs incurred under the contract 
we believe our operating results should be evaluated over a term of one to three years to consider our performance under long term contracts  after all change orders  scope changes and cost recoveries have been negotiated and realized 
estimates are subjective in nature and it is possible that we could have used different estimates of total contract costs in our calculation of revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method 
as of december   the company had million in revenues attributable to open percentage completion projects having an aggregate gross margin of 
if we had used a different estimate of total contract costs for each contract in progress at december   a increase or decrease in the estimated margin earned on each contract would have increased or decreased total revenue and pre tax income for the year ended

index to financial statements december   by approximately million 
as of december   the company had two contracts in a loss position  with an estimated aggregate loss of million 
we reported our revenue net of any tax assessed by a government authority and imposed concurrent with or subsequent to a revenue producing transaction between us and our customers 
goodwill evaluation 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of operating assets to the carrying value of those assets  including any related goodwill 
as required by sfas no 
 we identified separate reporting units for purposes of this evaluation 
we used our segments as the reporting units  and tested the segments as of december  in determining carrying value  we segregated assets and liabilities that  to the extent possible  are clearly identifiable by specific reporting unit 
certain corporate and other assets and liabilities  that are not clearly identifiable by specific reporting unit  are allocated as permitted by the standard 
fair value is determined by discounting projected future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital  as calculated 
in determining projected future cash flows for each segment  we make assumptions regarding the following key indicators future market and sales growth rates domestic and international  cost inflation  margin expectations  working capital  capital expenditure levels and tax levels 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine whether or not impairment has occurred at the reporting unit level 
in the event an impairment is indicated  an additional test is performed whereby an implied fair value of goodwill is determined through an allocation of the fair value to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  whether recognized or unrecognized  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
any residual fair value after this purchase price allocation would be assumed to relate to goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the residual fair value  we would record an impairment charge for that amount 
net goodwill was million at december  we tested goodwill for impairment as required by sfas no 
at december   and we did not record an impairment charge as a result of this testing 
if the estimated fair values discounted cash flow for the three segments  oil water technologies  gas technologies and automation controls  were reduced by  and respectively  we would have been required to perform the second step of goodwill impairment as prescribed by sfas no 
deferred income tax assets valuation allowance 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projected future taxable income over the periods to which our deferred tax assets are deductible in the applicable tax jurisdictions  we believe it is more likely than not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences and carryforwards  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  however  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  and thus the amount of these valuation allowances  could change if future taxable income differs from our projections in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
in certain foreign tax jurisdictions we are not able to rely on projections of future taxable income to determine the realizability of our deductible differences and carryforwards 
at december   the deferred tax assets of our uk operations were completely offset by a valuation allowance 
this was a result of cumulative pre tax losses of our uk operations for the prior three year period 
at december   our uk operations no longer had a cumulative pre tax loss for the prior three year period 
we are now projecting earnings and the valuation allowance related to our uk operations has been reduced to zero 
a valuation allowance of  is still recorded to offset net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions where we are not able to rely on projections of future taxable income 
share based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this method  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 

table of contents 
index to financial statements management is required to make subjective assumptions about the volatility of the company s common stock  the expected term of outstanding stock options  the risk free interest rate and expected dividend payments during the contractual life of the options in order to calculate the fair value of the award 
see note  share based compensation 
industry and business environment our revenue and results of operations are closely tied to demand for oil and gas products and spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
these companies generally invest more in exploration and development efforts during periods of favorable oil and gas commodity prices  and invest less during periods of unfavorable oil and gas prices 
as supply and demand change  commodity prices fluctuate  producing cyclical trends in the industry 
during periods of lower demand  revenue for service providers such as natco generally decline  as existing projects are completed  new projects are postponed and pricing decreases due to competitive pressures 
during periods of recovery  revenue for process equipment providers can lag behind the industry due to the timing of new project awards 
changes in commodity prices have impacted our business over the past several years 
the following table summarizes the price of domestic crude oil per barrel and the wellhead price of natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf  as published by the us department of energy  and the number of rotary drilling rigs in operation  as published by baker hughes incorporated  for the most recent five years year ended december  average price of crude oil per barrel in the us average price of brent crude oil per barrel average wellhead price of natural gas per mcf in the us average us rig count average international rig count excludes north america the iran and sudan rig counts were discontinued from the baker hughes publication beginning january for comparative purposes  the   and rig count numbers presented above exclude iran and sudan 
historically  we have viewed operating rig counts as a benchmark of spending in the us oil and gas industry for exploration and development efforts 
our standard and traditional equipment sales  parts and services business generally relates to changes in rig activity 
from a longer term perspective  the us department of energy projects that worldwide petroleum and natural gas consumption is projected to increase at an average annual growth rate of from through  with higher consumption rates expected in the emerging economies  particularly in asia including china and india  where of the total increase in world oil use is projected 
as worldwide demand grows  producers in the oil and gas industry will increasingly rely on non traditional sources of energy supply and expansion into new markets 
as a result  additional and more complex equipment may be required from equipment and service suppliers to produce oil and gas from these fields  especially since many new oil and gas fields produce lower quality or contaminated hydrocarbon streams  requiring more complex production equipment 
in general  these trends should increase the demand for our products and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are conducted around the world in a number of different countries 
accordingly  our earnings and cash flow are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions relate to operations in canada  uk and japan 
in canada  most contracts are denominated in canadian dollars  and most of the costs incurred are in canadian dollars  which mitigates risks associated with currency fluctuations 
in the uk  many of our sales contracts and material purchases are denominated in a currency other than british pounds sterling  primarily us dollars and euros  whereas our engineering and overhead costs are principally denominated in british pounds sterling 
in japan  most contracts are denominated in us dollars and most costs incurred are in japanese yen 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk by requiring settlement in our functional currencies  when possible 
we do not currently enter into forward contracts or other currency related derivative hedge arrangements 
our financial instruments are subject to changes in interest rates  including our revolving credit and term loan facilities  and our working capital facility for export sales
