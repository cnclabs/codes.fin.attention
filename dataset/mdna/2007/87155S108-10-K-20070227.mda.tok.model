item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation all percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
operating results for the year ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future fiscal years 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
overview our revenue and cash flows from operations have come from research collaborations  sale and support of laboratory systems  and licensing of software  discovered materials  and intellectual property 
we develop and apply high throughput experimentation to the discovery of innovative materials for chemical  energy  electronics  life science  and other industries 
we expect that our future cash flows and revenue will be comprised in large part of payments to be made and revenue to be earned under research and development collaborations together with product sales and license fees and royalties 
since our inception  we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  laboratory systems  and software necessary to transform traditional research and development and pursue high throughput discovery of materials 
through collaborations and our own internal research  we continue to develop and apply high throughput technologies for discovery of new materials 
our list of discovered materials continues to advance over time  including catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  polymers and phosphors for life science and industrial applications  and materials for electronics applications 
we apply our expertise in high throughput research technologies to offer a growing line of symyx tools to enable improved research and development execution in our customers laboratories 
we continue to expand symyx software  offering customers an integrated research and development execution and decision support system 
we believe we are now well positioned to capitalize on these investments 
recent developments our major recent developments and their impact on our business are highlighted below completion of million repurchase of million shares of symyx common stock creation and venture funding of visyx in november  providing a focused company for the commercial development of symyx sensor technology strategic investment in intermolecular inc  a venture backed company advancing technologies for semiconductor manufacturing commercialization of a symyx discovered polymer for an undisclosed electronic application by jsr corporation  bringing the total number of commercialized symyx discovered materials to five announcement by the dow chemical company of the introduction of a revolutionary olefin based elastomer  infuse olefin block copolymers  discovered by dow using symyx tools and manufactured using dow technologies and a symyx discovered catalyst 
sales of infuse are expected to generate royalty payments to symyx growth within symyx s historic base of life science customers  plus expansion through new industrial and academic customers acquisition of autodose in geneva  switzerland in july  providing an operating base in europe  advanced powder handling capabilities and a springboard for new benchtop tools products introduction of symyx benchtop system at the american laboratory association ala meeting in january  adding a significant new modular entry point for symyx tools and winning the ala new product award designation expanding adoption of symyx software by pharmaceutical companies plus increasing biotechnology company customer base and active evaluation by chemical companies introduction of three major new software product releases symyx eln software  discovery notebook and release of upgrades to the symyx lab execution and analysis applications in the year ended december   we generated total revenue of million  with operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
included in the operating income and net income were purchase accounting adjustments and other special charges arising from the acquisitions  including approximately million of an in process research and development charge  million of amortization of intangible assets  and other merger related expenses 
during  we generated a positive cash flow from operations 
after paying million to repurchase a portion of our common stock  making a million long term investment in intermolecular  inc  providing  of funding to visyx technologies inc and using a net million to acquire autodose  we ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of and to employees at the end of primarily as the result of acquisitions  the expansion of our software group  additional research personnel to meet our contractual obligations under our alliance agreements with exxonmobil and dow and additional sales and marketing resources 
we anticipate that our headcount will continue to increase to meet the mix and level of staffing required by our collaborative  tools and software agreements 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
we analyzed our stock based compensation strategies prior to the adoption of sfas r and made the decision to grant restricted stock units rather than stock options to our employees and non employee directors in to reduce stock based compensation expenses under sfas r  on two separate occasions during the three month period ended september   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved amendments to the terms of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock 
on each occasion  the terms of options with exercise prices above a designated threshold were amended to become fully vested and exercisable on december   provided that the holder of such option remained an employee or consultant of symyx on such date 
the first occasion was on september   when we amended the terms of outstanding options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock with exercise prices above per share 
the second occasion was on september   when we amended the terms of outstanding options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock with exercise prices equal or greater than per share 
all such options were issued pursuant to the terms of our various stock plans 
no options held by our executive officers or members of our board of directors were accelerated pursuant to this authorization 
no compensation expense was recorded in connection with the acceleration of the vesting schedule of the above options because the fair market value of the common stock was less than the exercise price of the accelerated options on each of the respective measurement dates 
these accelerations reduced compensation expenses that would have been recorded in accordance with sfas r in the consolidated income statement for the year ended december  we recognized stock based compensation expenses of million during the year ended december  stock based compensation expenses recognized in our results of operations for the year ended december  were as follows in thousands cost of products sold research and development sales  general and administrative total included in the above amounts are expenses related to restricted stock units of million  which would have been included in our consolidated income statement for the year ended december  under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

the expenses related to restricted stock units are therefore not considered as part of the impact of the adoption of sfas r for the year ended december  in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts 
as reported effect of adopting sfas r included income from continuing operations income before income tax expense and equity loss net income cash flow from operations cash flow from financing activities basic net income per share diluted net income per share in accordance with sfas r  stock based compensation expenses recognized in the consolidated income statement for the year ended december  were based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
the forfeiture rate was estimated to be between and based on historical turnover rates of different groups of employees 
the forfeiture rate is subject to revision  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in the pro forma information required under sfas for periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
as of december   we have the following unrecognized compensation costs a  related to unvested stock options granted and outstanding expected to be amortized on a graded vesting basis through  b  related to unvested restricted stock units granted expected to be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of to months  and c  related to our employee stock purchase plan espp expected to be amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average remaining period of months 
business acquisitions acquisition of autodose sa on july   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of privately held autodose sa autodose  a geneva  switzerland based maker of precision powder dispensing equipment 
by acquiring autodose  we will be able to offer customers tools that combine autodose s powder handling technology with our existing liquid handling robotics technology 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination 
autodose has since been renamed symyx technologies europe sa and its results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
the preliminary purchase price for this acquisition was  consisting of approximately  in cash including  to be paid to autodose s stockholders within months of the date of the acquisition and  in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
the above purchase price is preliminary because additional purchase price consideration of up to  may be payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in  and by autodose 
we will evaluate the possibility of achieving these targets from time to time and record the fair value of any additional consideration as an additional cost of the acquisition 
no additional consideration was recorded as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the preliminary purchase price to the tangible assets  liabilities  and intangible assets acquired  as well as ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess preliminary purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to our symyx tools segment 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the allocation of the preliminary purchase price 
in performing this allocation of the preliminary purchase price  we considered  among other factors  our intention for future use of the acquired assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of autodose s products 
the fair value of intangible assets was primarily based on the income approach 
the relief from royalty approach was also utilized when appropriate 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values ranged from to 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return and the weighted average return on assets 
risks we identified and considered in this analysis included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful completion of development efforts  market growth rates  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
identifiable intangible assets purchased in the autodose acquisition consisted of the following in thousands  except for useful life with a weighted average useful life of years no significant residual value is estimated for these assets amount useful life customer backlog year trade name years developed technology years customer relationships years total years as of july   autodose had been working on four development projects 
these projects have not yet been proven to be technologically feasible  but have been developed to a point where they had value associated with potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value of  was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the value of in process research and development ipr d was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
a discount rate of was used for ipr d  which is higher than the discount rate used to value certain other autodose assets due to inherent risk surrounding the successful development of the ipr d and the increase in projected financial results compared with historical results 
acquisition of synthematix  inc on april   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of privately held synthematix  inc  based in durham  north carolina 
synthematix was a provider of organic synthesis reaction planning software systems for scientific knowledge management in chemistry research  with customers primarily in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and fine chemical industries 
the results of synthematix s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
on august   synthematix was merged into one of our subsidiaries  symyx intellichem  inc  whose name was subsequently changed to symyx software  inc the purchase price for this acquisition was  consisting of approximately  in cash   in fair value of assumed stock options to purchase  shares of symyx common stock  and  in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the preliminary purchase price to the tangible assets  deferred compensation  liabilities  and intangible assets acquired  as well as ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to our software segment 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the purchase price allocation 
in performing this purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  its intention for future use of the acquired assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of synthematix s products 
the fair value of intangible assets was primarily based on the income approach 
the relief from royalty approach was also utilized when appropriate 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values ranged from to 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return and the weighted average return on assets 
risks we identified and considered in this analysis included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful completion of development efforts  market growth rates  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
identifiable intangible assets purchased in the synthematix acquisition consisted of the following in thousands  except for useful life with a weighted average useful life of years 
no significant residual value is estimated for these assets 
amount useful life trade name year developed technology years customer relationships years total years the ipr d project that synthematix was working on was the development of next generation of synthematix software 
at the date of acquisition  that software had not yet been proven to be technologically feasible but had been developed to a point where it had value associated with potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the value of ipr d was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
a discount rate of was used for ipr d which is higher than the discount rate used to value other synthematix assets due to inherent risk surrounding the successful development of the ipr d and the increase in projected financial results compared with historical results 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates include the forfeiture rate for stock based awards  future warranty expenditures and product life cycles  and assumptions such as the elements comprising a revenue arrangement  including the distinction between software upgrades enhancements and new products  when technological feasibility is achieved for the company s products  the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns  and determining when investment impairments are other than temporary 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  the emerging issues task force consensus on issue or eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and other authoritative accounting literature 
we generate revenue from services provided under research collaborations  the sale of products  license of software  provision of support and maintenance services  and the license of intellectual property 
it is possible for our customers to work with us in multiple areas of our business and contracts may include multiple elements of service revenue  product revenue  and license and royalty revenue 
in determining the basis for non software product revenue recognition  we first determine the fair value of any extended warranty services and defer this revenue to be recognized over the service period 
for those non software product sale contracts that involve multiple element deliverables  we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue among the units of accounting in accordance with eitf in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we recognize revenue from the software and software related elements  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality  in accordance with sop service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as support and maintenance or extended warranty agreements 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for symyx tools  comprising hardware  associated software and intellectual property licenses and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our software  intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory systems and software sold under license by third parties 
service revenue we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements  software consulting agreements  and support and maintenance agreements as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized as earned upon performance of the services over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk until the milestones are completed  is recognized upon completion of these milestone events 
milestone payments to date have been immaterial 
revenue allocable to support and maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the support and maintenance is provided 
our software licenses may provide for technical support  bug fixes  and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis for periods defined within the contract 
revenue related to this post contract customer support is deferred and recognized over the term of the contracted support 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of symyx tools hardware and the license of associated software  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance has been achieved 
a determination is made for each system delivered as to whether software is incidental to the system as a whole 
if software is not incidental to the symyx tools as a whole  revenue from these arrangements is recognized in accordance with sop  as amended 
if software is incidental to the symyx tools  revenue from the sale of the symyx tools is earned and recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual method to allocate revenue to delivered elements once we have established fair value for all undelivered elements 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of delivery 
software license fees for software licensed on an annual right to use basis  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the license 
for revenue allocable to the software portion of a multiple element arrangement or licensed on a perpetual basis  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software product to the end user and commencement of the license  unless we have ongoing obligations for which fair value cannot be established or the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not probable  in which case we recognize revenue only when each of these criteria have been met 
by way of example  for the eln software products that we acquired from intellichem  inc and synthematix  inc  we have not yet established the fair value of certain ongoing obligations and accordingly  any perpetual license fees are recognized ratably over the period of the ongoing obligations typically a bundled support and maintenance commitment of one year 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value for any remaining undelivered elements can be established 
intellectual property license fees and royalties we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed or determinable 
we recognize royalty revenue based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
if there are extended payment terms  royalty revenue is recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
stock based compensation prior to january   we elected to follow apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements prior to january  in connection with stock based awards granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value on the grant date 
deferred compensation for options assumed in connection with business combinations was determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of our common stock on the date options were assumed 
deferred compensation was amortized on a graded vesting method through december  we adopted sfas r  effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  includes a espp awards with offering periods commencing  and stock options granted or assumed  prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  b espp awards with offering periods commencing subsequent to december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and c restricted stock units awarded subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods are not restated 
see note and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
warranty expense accrual a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a symyx tools system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each symyx tools system delivered and establishes the accrual based  in part  on reference to actual warranty costs incurred on similar systems 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material impact on our financial statements 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our original estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
in years  and  we have recorded favorable adjustments of approximately   and  respectively 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for research and development costs sfas  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material  and accordingly  we have expensed our software development costs when incurred 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
intangible assets we amortize intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill which is not subject to amortization  over their estimated economic lives 
determining the estimated economic life of intangible assets requires judgment on the part of management 
for example  if we determined that the estimated economic lives of these assets were one year less than those reported in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the amortization expense of intangibles would have been increased by million 
we conduct impairment reviews of intangible assets annually or when circumstances indicate the potential impairment of intangible assets 
we also review the amortization periods for intangible assets when circumstances indicate there may be a change in economic lives of intangible assets 
valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists 
no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
results of operations revenue amount in s change over previous year amount in s change over previous year amount in s service revenue product sales license fees and royalties total revenue our total revenue increased from to and from to these increases were primarily due to the expansion of revenue under our alliances with exxonmobil and the dow chemical company  particularly in regard to sale of tools  as well as an increase in software license fees and royalties from new and existing customers 
in  we commenced bifurcating symyx tools sales transactions into product sales revenue reported under the symyx tools segment and software license fees revenue the majority of which was reported under the symyx software segment 
prior to  symyx tools sales transactions were reported solely in the product sales revenue line in the consolidated income statements 
it was not practical to bifurcate the symyx tools sales transactions recorded prior to into product sales and software license fees revenue 
revenue is attributed to the following geographic locations based on the physical location of symyx s customers as a percentage of total revenue in the respective periods north america japan belgium europe excluding belgium total the following table lists our major customers for the years ended december   and and revenue generated from these customers as a percentage of our total revenue in the respective periods 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be generated from a few key customers 
exxonmobil the dow chemical company total we segregate revenue by the following segments amount in s change over previous year amount in s change over previous year amount in s collaborations symyx tools symyx software materials and ip licensing symyx sensors total the reconciliation of segment revenue above to the revenue disclosed in the consolidated income statements is provided in note segment disclosure of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
collaborations revenue the collaborations group generates revenue primarily from the research services it provides to our collaboration partners 
the increase in collaborations revenue from to was primarily attributable to the funding received under the alliance agreement we entered into with the dow chemical company effective january  partially offset by a decrease in the level of funding received from an undisclosed partner 
in  revenue from collaborations decreased due to the expiration of the collaboration with bp  partially offset by a new collaboration we started with d systems 
we expect to receive over million in revenue from exxonmobil and over million in revenue from dow during the five year term of each of the alliances  through our research collaborations  product sales  and license of software and intellectual property 
through december   we had recognized million and million of revenue from the exxonmobil and dow alliances  respectively  including a total of approximately million in collaborations revenue from these two alliances 
we believe these two alliances will continue to be the major contributors to our collaborations revenue in symyx tools revenue the symyx tools group generates revenue primarily from the sale of symyx tools and associated services 
symyx tools revenue increased from million in to million in and million in for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue and  of license revenue 
the increase in symyx tools revenue in and was primarily due to increased shipments of symyx tools 
during the years ended december  and  we shipped and tools  respectively  including our core x modules and extended core modules and autodose s benchtop products  to chemical  life science  academic institutions  and several other customers 
we adopted our modular strategy in to facilitate timely customer purchases because purchase decisions on a complete symyx tools system may take a long time 
this modular approach allows our customers to build up full combinatorial high throughput experimentation capability over time by acquiring stand alone portions of a symyx tools system that integrate together to make an entire workflow 
under the exxonmobil and dow alliances  we are contracted to deliver multiple symyx tools in the next few years 
we also negotiate with other chemical and life science companies for the sale of symyx tools 
we believe our expanding customer base will contribute to our expected growth of symyx tools revenue 
symyx software revenue the symyx software group generates revenue primarily from the licensing of software  including laboratory execution and analysis lea and electronic laboratory notebook eln software  and provision of associated support  maintenance and consulting services 
symyx software revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in symyx software revenue in was primarily due to increased revenue from software licenses  and associated maintenance and support from the dow chemical company as well as a number of customers accessed through our acquisition of intellichem and our acquisition of synthematix 
the increase in symyx software revenue in was due primarily to increased revenue from software licenses and services provided particularly to large life science companies where our eln software has established itself as the industry leader 
we expect symyx software revenue will continue to grow as we recognize the revenue for licenses and services under these as well as new agreements 
materials licensing and ip revenue the materials and ip licensing group generates revenue primarily from the licensing fees received from licensing our intellectual property and from royalties paid by third party licensees for sale of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
materials and ip licensing revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in licensing revenue in over was primarily due to payments received from the dow chemical company 
the increase in licensing revenue in over was primarily due to royalty payments received on products at the early stage of commercialization by our customers 
we believe that the demonstrated acceptance of our high throughput experimentation technology by our customers will lead to the expected growth in our license fee revenue in future years 
we currently have five materials commercialized by celanese  dow  jsr corporation and agfa gevaert nv we anticipate that our customers may commercialize an additional three materials during we believe that these commercialized materials will contribute to our growth in intellectual property and materials licensing revenue in the future 
symyx sensors revenue the symyx sensors group  prior to its spin out into visyx technologies inc  provided development services and licenses for specific applications of our sensor technology 
symyx sensors revenue in both and consisted primarily of payments received from hella kg 
symyx sensors revenue increased significantly in over due primarily to payments received from univation for sensor development services  partially offset by a decrease in payments received from hella kg 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue in  compared to million  or of product sales revenue in and million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the increase in the total cost of products sold in and was primarily due to the increase of products sold 
the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales revenue in compared to was due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years  and the development costs related to prototypes sold being previously expensed as development costs  as discussed below 
the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales revenue in compared to was due to a change in the product mix shipped in the respective years  the change in of bifurcation of symyx tools sales transactions into product sales revenue and software license fees revenue discussed under revenue above  as well as an unfavorable inventory obsolescence charge of approximately  in the cost of products sold will continue to be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volume in each period 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales is expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period because the majority of symyx tools are built to order or to particular specifications 
for systems that include a significant development component prior to their commercial build  or systems sold to customers as a prototype  the development costs incurred prior to the commercial build are expensed as development costs  included in research and development expenses  which results in a lower cost of products sold and higher margin in the quarter in which such a system is sold to the customer 
the cost of products sold may also be affected by adjustments to the warranty expense accrual for pre existing sales 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
other operating expenses amount in s as a percentage of total revenue change over previous year amount in s as a percentage of total revenue change over previous year amount in s as a percentage of total revenue research and development sales  general and administrative acquired in process research and development amortization of intangible assets arising from business combinations total operating expenses less than research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expenses totaling million in  facility costs  supplies  and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom we conducted research and development  together with the date upon which the current contract ends and the primary focus of the collaborations 
partner current research contract ends primary focus of current collaborative efforts the dow chemical company polyolefin catalysts for certain commodity chemicals exxonmobil catalysts for certain commodity chemicals including olefins we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  based on hours spent on each project  we estimate the research and development efforts undertaken for various projects were as follows projects funded by collaboration partners projects funded internally software development research tools development total due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and  therefore  whether we will achieve future milestones or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
research and development expenses in included million of direct costs of research services provided to ilypsa  a related party 
the increase of research and development expenses in and was driven primarily by the increases in salary related expenses due to the hiring of additional scientific and technical staff to work on research and development projects for exxonmobil and dow and increased headcount to develop our software platform 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in compared to primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense

our core business areas are research to discover new materials  the sale of instruments and licensing of related software and licensing of intellectual property and materials discovered in our collaborative and internal research programs

the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to an increase of personnel costs  mainly as a result of adding a number of business development and sales staff to manage and support our growth  and an increase in auditing and tax related service fees  largely as a result of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  offset partially by the decrease in legal fees for intellectual property litigation 
we expect that our sales  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we increase headcount to support the growth in our business  add to and improve our existing facilities  and incur escalating costs related to being a public company  such as increasing professional fees  including costs associated with continued compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and tax fees particularly in relation to the adoption of fin in sales  general and administrative expenses represented  and of total revenue for years ended december   and  respectively

the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach 
at the date of the autodose acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed at the acquisition date in in april  we acquired synthematix in a transaction accounted for as a business combination

provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in  million in and million in our effective income tax rate was for  for and for the effective income tax rate for is higher than our statutory rate principally due to the non deductibility of both the in process research and development charge from the autodose acquisition and certain stock based compensation expenses 
the effective income tax rate was significantly lower than our statutory rate in due to the recognition of approximately million of income tax benefits from certain of our deferred tax assets in  which had previously been offset by a valuation allowance 
we expect our income tax rate to be close to as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily relate to state research and development credits and the temporary difference between book and tax depreciation expenses and stock based compensation  partially offset by deferred tax liabilities recognized for intangible assets in the intellichem  synthematix  and autodose acquisitions 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating losses from the acquisitions of synthematix may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions

fin will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects

early application of the guidance in sab is encouraged in any report for an interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had positive cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  and finished the year with cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million 
this compared to cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million at december  during  we used million to repurchase our common stock  million for capital expenditure  million for a long term investment in intermolecular  inc   for our investment in visyx technologies inc  and a net of million for the acquisition of autodose sa 
as of december   we had  of noncurrent deferred tax liabilities arising from the autodose acquisition 
our operating activities provided million  million and million of cash in   and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners and revenue from product sales and licensing  partially offset by operating expenses 
we expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from our operating activities on an annual basis  although this may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
depending on the timing of tools deliveries and customer payments  we may experience negative cash flows from operating activities 
as a result of adopting sfas r  million of excess tax benefits for the year ended december  have been classified as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  in   and included in the cash used in investing activities were million for long term investments in intermolecular and visyx and a net of million for the acquisition of autodose 
during the same period of time  the majority of proceeds from the maturities of available for sale securities were re invested in available for sale securities 
included in the cash used in investing activities was the million net cash paid for the acquisition of synthematix 
included in the cash used in investing activities was the million net cash paid for the acquisition of intellichem 
the other fluctuations from period to period were due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales  and maturity of our available for sale securities 
cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment was million  million and million  respectively  in   and the increase of cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment in was primarily associated with the build out of an additional leased facility 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchases of property and equipment to support our expanding operations 
financing activities used million of cash in and provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the cash inflows were primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee share purchase plan in each of the three years and for  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash outflows from financing activities in consisted of million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
our accounts receivable balance at december  increased significantly compared to december  due to the large number of symyx tools delivered late in the last quarter of current liabilities increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  all current liabilities  except for deferred rent  have increased in due to the expansion of our operations in backlog as of december   our customers have contractually committed to fund of approximately million and million  respectively  for year and beyond  for the purchase of symyx tools  licenses to our intellectual property and software  and research work to be undertaken 
principal commitments our principal commitments consist of our obligations under operating leases  our commitments to purchase inventory and fixed assets  and our commitments made for leasehold improvements 
as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
subsequently in january  we extended our lease for one of our facilities in sunnyvale  california  until november  which resulted in an incremental commitment of million 
we expect to satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next nine years 
future principal commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years facility commitments purchase commitments total we believe that our current cash  available for sale securities balances and the cash flows expected to be generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the coming year 
nonetheless  we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
other commitments as discussed in the off balance sheet financing and related party transactions below  our commitment for future investments pursuant to the collaborative development and license agreement and the alliance agreement with intermolecular  inc as of december  were  we expect to meet this commitment during the next two years with additional research efforts and capital expenditures

such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the indemnification is typically limited to no more than the amount paid by the customer 
as of december   we were not subject to any pending intellectual property related litigation 
contingencies as discussed in the note of notes to consolidated financial statements  additional purchase price consideration of up to  may be payable upon the achievement of certain  and revenue targets by autodose 
we will evaluate the possibility of achieving these targets from time to time and record the fair value of any additional consideration as an additional cost of the acquisition 
no additional consideration was recorded as of december  insurance we carry insurance with coverage and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  our management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations

each party is bearing its own expenses
