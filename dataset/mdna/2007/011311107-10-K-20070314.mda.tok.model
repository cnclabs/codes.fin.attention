the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  it records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected 
for all other customers  it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions 
the company evaluates all aged receivables that are over days old and will reserve specifically on a day basis 
the company has a secured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases 
this allows the company  in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy usually chapter  to repossess the customer s inventory 
this also allows alamo group to maintain only a reserve over its cost which usually represents the margin on the original sales price 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  at december   and  at december  sales discounts at december  the company had  in reserves for sales discounts compared to  at december  on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs 
the decrease was due primarily to lower agricultural sales that resulted in a reduction of discounts available on the company s rhino and m w products ordered during the pre season program  which ran from july to december of and are shipped through the second quarter of the company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time 
the company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program 
historically between and of the company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available 
inventories obsolete and slow moving the company had a reserve of  at december  and  at december  to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the increase was mainly due to the acquisition of gradall and to exchange rate fluctuations 
the obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows no inventory usage over a three year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at percent  and slow moving inventory with little usage requires a percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three year supply 
there may be exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the company  based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification 
the reserve is reviewed and  if necessary  adjustments are made on a quarterly basis 
the company relies on historical information to support its reserve 
the company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
warranty the company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and days for parts 
warranty reserve  as a percent of sales  is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety day to six month lag period 
the company s historical experience is that an end user takes approximately days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim 
a warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group 
reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required 
the current liability warranty reserve balance was  at december  and  at december  a long term warranty liability of  relating to gradall excavators and schwarze sweepers existed at december  with a life range of to years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various financial market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk international sales a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk  france  canada and australia 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financials  specifically the value of its foreign assets  could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the company distribute their products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company s uk subsidiaries regularly hedge by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had  outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable  additionally  there was an exchange contract of  relating to a short term inter company cash transfer from the uk to the uk a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
at january   the foreign currency hedge agreements were in an unfavorable position by approximately  in accordance with the provisions of fas  the net of tax on january   was a loss of  in accumulated other comprehensive income with a deferred income tax of  at december   the fair value of the hedge agreements was in an favorable position  therefore  the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a gain of  accumulated other comprehensive income was adjusted to an accumulated gain of  and the deferred income tax was adjusted to an  tax liability 
as the hedge agreements are deemed to be effective cash flow hedges  there was no income statement impact related to hedge ineffectiveness 
the company has reclassified approximately  of existing losses in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  during the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries  canada and australia  as a result of the sale of its products in international markets 
foreign currency forward contracts in the uk are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ended december  comparatively  at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately  for the year ended december  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a gain of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to the us dollar  and the euro closed at 
relative to the us dollar 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to the us dollar  and euro closed at 
relative to the us dollar 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such actions 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
