any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties associated with economic conditions in the commercial interiors industry as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed immediately below 
we compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive commercial floorcovering products market  and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
the commercial floorcovering industry is highly competitive 
globally  we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering 
although the industry has experienced significant consolidation  a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry 
some of our competitors  including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business  have greater financial resources than we do 
sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings 
sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings 
this activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country s or region s general economy  prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space 
the effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment 
historically  we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market 
the effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment 
the adverse cycle during the years through significantly lessened the overall demand for commercial interiors products  which adversely affected our business during those years 
these effects may recur and could be more pronounced if the global economy does not improve or is further weakened 
our success depends significantly upon the efforts  abilities and continued service of our senior management executives and our principal design consultant  and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely 
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives 
in addition  we rely significantly on the leadership that david oakey of david oakey designs provides to our internal design staff 
specifically  david oakey designs provides product design production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non competition covenants 
our current agreement with david oakey designs extends to april the loss of any of these key persons could have an adverse impact on our business 
our substantial international operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results  including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have substantial international operations 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia pacific 
our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis 
as a result  our operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of restrictive taxation policies  changing political conditions and governmental regulations 
we also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than us dollars approximately of net sales  which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations 
the scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results 
large increases in the cost of petroleum based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers 
petroleum based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases  continued large increases in the cost of petroleum based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers 
unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber could have a material adverse effect on us 
invista inc  a subsidiary of koch industries  inc  currently supplies approximately of our requirements for synthetic fiber nylon  which is the principal raw material that we use in our carpet products 
in addition  other of our businesses have a high degree of dependence on their third party suppliers of synthetic fiber for certain products or markets 
the unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us because of the cost and delay associated with shifting more business to another supplier 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with invista 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could have important negative consequences to us 
our substantial indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth initiatives  and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth initiatives  and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline 
the market price of our class a common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward 
such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq global market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value 
as a general matter  market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
we thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward 
our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non cash adjustments to goodwill  if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets 
as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements 
our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year  unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment 
in the past  we have had non cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings million in  million in and million in 
a future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non cash adjustment  which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period 
our chairman  together with other insiders  currently has sufficient voting power to elect a majority of our board of directors 
our chairman  ray c 
anderson  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding class b common stock 
the holders of the class b common stock are entitled  as a class  to elect a majority of our board of directors 
therefore  mr 
anderson  together with other insiders  has sufficient voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors 
on all other matters submitted to the shareholders for a vote  the holders of the class b common stock generally vote together as a single class with the holders of the class a common stock 
mr 
anderson s beneficial ownership of the outstanding class a and class b common stock combined is approximately 
our rights agreement could discourage tender offers or other transactions for our stock that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our stock 
our board of directors adopted a rights agreement in pursuant to which holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase from us a fraction of a share of our series b participating cumulative preferred stock if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock without our consent 
in addition  the holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase the stock of an acquiring person as defined in the rights agreement at a discount upon the occurrence of triggering events 
these provisions of the rights agreement could have the effect of discouraging tender offers or other transactions that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products primarily modular and broadloom carpet  interior fabrics and other specialty products 
our commercial interiors business  as well as the commercial interiors industry in general  is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space 
the commercial interiors industry is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces 
in significant part  the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations 
as a result  macroeconomic factors such as employment rates  office vacancy rates  capital spending  productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general  also affect our businesses 
during the past several years  we have successfully focused more of our marketing and sales efforts on non corporate office segments to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely  as well as to capture additional market share 
our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office modular carpet sales in the americas has shifted over the past several years to and  respectively  for compared with and  respectively  in we expect a further shift in the future as we continue to implement our segmentation strategy 
during the years through except for a modest rebound during the latter portion of  the commercial interiors industry as a whole  and the broadloom carpet market in particular  experienced decreased demand levels 
the general downturn in the domestic and international economy that characterized most of  and further adversely affected the commercial interiors industry  especially in the us corporate office market segment 
these conditions significantly impaired our growth and operating profitability during those years 
during  and particularly in the second half of the year  the commercial interiors industry began recovering from the downturn  which led to improved sales and operating profitability for us 
that recovery continued at a gradual pace throughout and common stock offering on november   we sold  shares of our class a common stock which amount includes the underwriters exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional  shares to cover over allotments at a public offering price of per share pursuant to a common stock offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we plan to use the net proceeds to repay some of our outstanding debt and may use a portion of such proceeds for general corporate purposes 
repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  the company repatriated an aggregate of million of earnings from foreign subsidiaries during this action took advantage of an opportunity to repatriate the funds at a substantially reduced tax rate  provided the transaction occurred before the end of consequently  the company recorded aggregate tax charges of million  or per diluted share  during related to the repatriation 
discontinued operations of re source dealer businesses during the years leading up to  our owned re source dealer businesses  which were part of a broader network comprised of both owned and aligned dealers that sell and install floorcovering products  experienced decreased sales volumes and intense pricing pressure  primarily as a result of the economic downturn in the commercial interiors industry 
as a result  in  we decided to exit our owned re source dealer businesses and began to dispose of several of our dealer subsidiaries 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we have reported the results of operations for the owned re source dealer businesses as well as the results of operations of a small australian dealer business and a small residential fabrics business that we also decided to exit  for all periods reflected herein  as discontinued operations 
consequently  our discussion of revenues or sales and other results of operations except for net income or loss amounts  including percentages derived from or based on such amounts  excludes these discontinued operations unless we indicate otherwise 
in the third quarter of  we completed the last in a series of transactions by which we sold nine of our owned re source dealer businesses 
the nine dealer businesses sold were part of the fifteen re source dealer businesses that we owned at the time our plan to exit the owned dealer businesses was announced in eight of the nine businesses were sold to either the general managers of the respective businesses or an entity in which the general manager participated  and the other business was sold to our aligned  but not owned  dealer in the relevant geographic region 
the aggregate net consideration we received in connection with the sales was million plus the purchasers assumption of various liabilities and obligations 
of that dollar amount  an aggregate of million was paid in cash at the closings  with the remainder of million payable pursuant to promissory notes at interest rates ranging from prime to and with maturities ranging from one to three years 
we have terminated all ongoing operations of the other six owned dealer businesses  and in some cases we are completing their wind down through subcontracting arrangements 
in the first quarter of  we sold certain assets relating to our aligned dealer network  and we are discontinuing its operations as well 
these discontinued operations represented revenues of million  million and million in years  and  respectively these results are included in our statements of operations as part of the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
loss from operations of these businesses  net of tax  was million  million and million in years  and  respectively 
we recorded write downs  net of taxes  for the impairment of assets of million in and for the impairment of assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively  in to adjust the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their net realizable value 
during and  we recorded losses of million and million  respectively  in connection with the disposal of certain of these businesses 
impact of strategic restructuring initiatives we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of the charge reflected the closure of our fabrics manufacturing facility in east douglas  massachusetts  and consolidation of those operations into our facility in elkin  north carolina  workforce reduction at the east douglas  massachusetts facility  and a reduction in carrying value of another fabrics facility and other assets 
the restructuring charge was comprised of million of cash expenditures for severance benefits and other similar costs  and million of non cash charges  primarily for the write down of carrying value and disposal of assets 
these restructuring activities are expected to reduce excess capacity in our fabrics dyeing and finishing operations and improve overall manufacturing efficiency 
no restructuring charges were incurred in or goodwill impairment write down in april  subsequent to the end of the first quarter of  we sold our european fabrics business camborne holdings limited for approximately million to an entity formed by the business management team 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a pre tax non cash charge of million for the impairment of goodwill in the first quarter of  and we recorded a million loss on disposal of the business in the second quarter of for the first quarter of  the european fabrics business generated revenue of million and operating loss after the million goodwill impairment charge of million 
during the fourth quarters of each of the years to  we performed the annual goodwill impairment tests required by sfas no 
in effecting the impairment testing  we used an outside consultant to help prepare valuations of reporting units in accordance with the applicable standards  and those valuations were compared with the respective book values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment existed 
in preparing the valuations  past  present and future expectations of performance were considered 
no impairment was indicated in our continuing operations during these years 
however  an after tax impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal year related to our discontinued re source dealer businesses 
results of operations the following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections 
in addition  we believe our performance during reflects the unprecedented downturn experienced by the commercial interiors industry in general during that time  which we discuss elsewhere 
our net sales that were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar were approximately in  approximately in  and approximately in because we have such substantial international operations  we are impacted  from time to time  by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions 
for example  the performance of the euro against the us dollar  for purposes of the translation of european revenues into us dollars  favorably affected our reported results in and  when the euro was strengthening relative to the us dollar 
in  however  when the euro weakened relative to the us dollar  the translation of european revenues into us dollars adversely affected our reported results 
the following table presents the amount in us dollars by which the exchange rates for converting euros into us dollars have affected our net sales and operating income during the past three years in millions net sales operating income all amounts above for all periods exclude our discontinued operations  primarily comprised of our us raised access flooring business which we sold in september and our owned re source dealer businesses which we exited during 
the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december  fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit on sales selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill loss on disposal european fabrics restructuring charges operating income interest other expense income loss from continuing operations before tax income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax loss on disposal net income loss below we provide information regarding net sales for each of our four operating segments  and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years 
fiscal year was a week period  while fiscal years and were week periods 
the weeks in versus the weeks in and are a factor in certain of the comparisons reflected below 
net sales by business segment we currently classify our businesses into the following four operating segments for reporting purposes modular carpet segment  which includes our interfaceflor  heuga and flor modular carpet businesses  and also includes our intersept antimicrobial chemical sales and licensing program  bentley prince street segment  which includes our bentley prince street broadloom  modular carpet and area rug businesses  fabrics group segment  which includes all of our fabrics businesses worldwide  and specialty products segment  which includes our subsidiary pandel  inc  a producer of vinyl carpet tile backing and specialty mat and foam products 
on march   we sold pandel to an entity formed by the general manager of that business 
net sales by operating segment and for our company as a whole were as follows for the three years ended december  fiscal year ended percentage change net sales by segment compared with compared with in thousands modular carpet bentley prince street fabrics group specialty products total modular carpet segment 
for  net sales for the modular carpet segment increased million versus the comparable period in the weighted average selling price per square yard in was up compared with  which was partially due to our passing through to customers increases in our cost of petroleum based raw materials 
on a geographic basis  we experienced significant increases in net sales in the americas increase  europe increase and the asia pacific region increase 
our increase in the americas was primarily due to the continued strength of the corporate office market increase and the success of our segmentation strategy  which saw significant increases in the hospitality increase  residential increase and healthcare increase segments 
the increase in europe was driven by the strong corporate office market increase as well as success in non corporate segments such as institutional which includes education and governmental entities increase and hospitality increase 
our success in asia pacific was primarily due to the continued strength of the corporate office market increase and was offset somewhat by declines in the hospitality and retail segments 
for  net sales for the worldwide modular carpet segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard in was up compared with  primarily due to our passing through to customers increases in our cost of petroleum based raw materials 
on a geographic basis  we experienced increases in net sales in the americas  europe and asia pacific  which were up  and  respectively 
in the americas  we saw significant increases in our sales into the hospitality increase  retail increase  and corporate office increase market segments 
sales growth in europe was attributable primarily to our gaining market share from competitors in an otherwise down geographic market 
sales growth in asia pacific was attributable in large part to a relatively good economic climate in that region 
bentley prince street segment 
for  net sales in the bentley prince street segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard was up approximately compared with  which was partially due to our passing through to our customers increases in our cost of petroleum based raw materials 
the increase in sales is attributable primarily due to the success of our segmentation strategy  which led to increases in the hospitality increase  healthcare increase and residential increase segments during the year 
for  net sales in the bentley prince street segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard in was up compared with  primarily due to our passing through to customers increases in our cost of petroleum based raw materials 
the increase in sales occurred primarily in the improving corporate office market segment  which was up 
growth in our non corporate office market segments was driven by institutional increase  retail increase and residential increase purchases 
fabrics group segment 
for  net sales for our fabrics group segment decreased million versus this decline was the result of the sale of our european fabrics business in april the european fabrics business accounted for million in net sales during during  the weighted average selling price per linear yard was up approximately compared with  which was partially due to the passing through to customers increases in our cost of petroleum based products 
for  net sales for our fabrics group segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per linear yard in was up compared with  primarily due to our passing through to customers increases in our cost of petroleum based raw materials

specialty products segment 
for  net sales for our specialty products segment decreased by million compared with the prior year 
this decrease was primarily the result of the loss of one major customer and the inconsistent order pattern of another major customer that adversely affected results 
for  net sales for our specialty products segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard in was up compared with  primarily due to our passing through to customers increases in the cost of petroleum based raw materials 
the increase in sales occurred primarily in the corporate office market 
cost and expenses company consolidated 
the following table presents  on a consolidated basis for our operations  our overall cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december fiscal year ended percentage change cost and expenses compared with compared with in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses total for  our costs of sales increased million versus  primarily due to increased raw materials costs million and labor costs million associated with increased production levels during our raw materials costs in were up an estimated versus  primarily due to increased prices for petroleum based products 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to versus during the percentage decrease is primarily due to the increased absorption of fixed manufacturing costs associated with increased production levels 
for  our cost of sales increased million versus  primarily due to increased raw material costs million and labor costs million associated with increased production levels during our raw materials costs in were up an estimated versus  primarily due to increased prices for petroleum based products 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to for  versus for the percentage decrease was primarily due to increased absorption of fixed manufacturing costs associated with increased production levels 
for  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million versus the primary components of this increase were million in increased selling costs due to the increased level of sales in  as well as planned investments in our segmentation strategy and in the expansion of our sales force  and million of increased administrative expenses  primarily due to increased information technology costs  investments in our administration infrastructure related to our residential business  and increased legal expenses 
for  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million versus the primary components of this increase were million due to increased investments in global marketing campaigns across our businesses  million of performance bonuses  and million in commission payments due to the increased level of sales in these increases were partially offset by reductions in administrative costs of million 
cost and expenses by segment 
the following table presents the combined cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses for each of our operating segments for the three years ended december  fiscal year ended percentage change cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses combined compared with compared with in thousands modular carpet bentley prince street fabrics group specialty products corporate expenses total interest and other expense for  interest expense decreased by million versus the decrease was due primarily to repurchases of approximately million of our bonds during the year 
this decrease in interest was partially offset by increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement for the first three quarters of for  interest expense decreased million versus the decrease was due primarily to the lower levels of debt outstanding on a daily basis during versus  and was somewhat offset by an overall increase in interest rates when compared with tax our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective tax rate of in this increase in rate is primarily attributable to million of non deductible losses in connection with the disposal of our european fabrics business  and the repatriation of earnings related to the disposal of this business 
our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective tax rate of in the increase in rate is primarily attributable to taxes associated with our repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings  which is discussed above  a reduced state tax benefit attributable to us operations as a result of lower pre tax losses in the us in  and our provision of a valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to utilize 
these factors were somewhat offset by decreases in the tax rate components associated with foreign operations and non deductible business expenses 
liquidity and capital resources general in our business  we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs  in addition to funding normal course selling  general and administrative expenses  anticipated capital expenditures  and potential special projects 
we generate our cash and other liquidity requirements from our operations and from borrowings or letters of credit under our revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate 
we believe that our liquidity position will provide sufficient funds to meet our current commitments and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we also believe that we will be able to continue to enhance the generation of free cash flow particularly in the short term because we have no significant debt maturity until april through the following initiatives improve our inventory turns by continuing to implement a make to order model throughout our organization  reduce our average days sales outstanding through improved credit and collection practices  and limit the amount of our capital expenditures generally to those projects that have a short term payback period 
historically  we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year  as we fund insurance premiums  tax payments  incentive compensation  and inventory build up in preparation for the holiday vacation season of our international operations 
however  we believe that our liquidity position and cash provided by operations will provide sufficient funds to meet our current commitments and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future  primarily because we had over million of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility as of december   and we have no maturities of long term debt until april in addition  we have a high contribution margin business with low capital expenditure requirements 
contribution margin represents variable gross profit margin less the variable component of selling  general and administrative expenses  and for us is an indicator of profit on incremental sales after the fixed components of cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses have been recovered 
while contribution margin should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin  which is determined in accordance with gaap  it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our potential for profitability 
in addition  we believe that investors find contribution margin to be a useful tool for measuring our profitability on an operating basis 
furthermore  on november   we sold  shares of our class a common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we plan to use the net proceeds to repay some of our outstanding debt and may use a portion of such proceeds for general corporate purposes 
nevertheless  our ability to generate cash from operating activities is uncertain because we are subject to  and recently have experienced  fluctuations in our level of net sales 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the interest and principal on our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
at december   we had million in cash 
as of december   no borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and we could have incurred an additional million of borrowings thereunder 
we have approximately million in contractual cash obligations due by the end of fiscal year  which includes  among other things  capital expenditure purchase commitments and interest payments on our debt 
we currently estimate aggregate capital expenditures will be between million and million for based on current interest rate and debt levels  we expect our aggregate interest expense for to be between million and million 
in february  we issued million in senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to redeem in full our previously outstanding senior subordinated notes due  with the remainder of million after fees and expenses used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
it is important for you to consider that our revolving credit facility matures in june  and our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes mature at times ranging from to we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing  we would have to consider other options  such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs  or using cash  if available  that would have been used for other business purposes 
revolving credit facility we amended and restated our primary senior revolving credit facility on june  it provides for a maximum aggregate amount of loans and letters of credit of up to million at any one time  subject to the borrowing base described below 
the key features of the revolving credit facility are as follows the revolving credit facility currently matures on june   the revolving credit facility includes a domestic us dollar syndicated loan and letter of credit facility made available to interface  inc up to the lesser of million  or a borrowing base equal to the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and at our option real estate in the united states the percentages and eligibility requirements for the borrowing base are specified in the credit facility  less certain reserves  advances under the loan facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of interface  inc s assets and the assets of each of its material domestic subsidiaries  which have guaranteed the revolving credit facility  and the revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant a fixed charge coverage ratio test that becomes effective in the event that our excess borrowing availability falls below million 
in such event  we must comply with the financial covenant for a period commencing on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding such event unless such event occurs on the last day of a fiscal quarter  in which case the compliance period commences on such date and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fiscal quarter in which such event occurred  the revolving credit facility also includes various reporting  affirmative and negative covenants  and other provisions that restrict our ability to take certain actions  including provisions that restrict our ability to repay our long term indebtedness unless we meet a specified minimum excess availability test 
interest rates and fees 
interest on borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from to  in the case of advances at a prime interest rate  and to  in the case of advances at libor over a baseline rate such as the prime interest rate or libor  depending on the type of borrowing and our average excess borrowing availability during the most recently completed fiscal quarter 
in addition  we pay an unused line fee on the facility ranging from to depending on our average excess borrowing availability during the most recently completed fiscal quarter 
prepayments 
our revolving credit facility requires prepayment from the proceeds of certain asset sales 
covenants 
the revolving credit facility also limits our ability  among other things  to incur indebtedness or contingent obligations  make acquisitions of or investments in businesses in excess of certain specified amounts  sell or dispose of assets in excess of certain specified amounts  create or incur liens on assets  and enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
we are presently in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility and anticipate that we will remain in compliance with the covenants for the foreseeable future 
events of default 
if interface  inc and certain of its subsidiaries fails to perform or breaches any of the affirmative or negative covenants under the revolving credit facility  or if other specified events occur such as a bankruptcy or similar event or a change of control of interface  inc or certain subsidiaries  or if we breach or fail to perform any covenant or agreement contained in any instrument relating to any of our other indebtedness exceeding million  after giving effect to any applicable notice and right to cure provisions  an event of default will exist 
if an event of default exists and is continuing  the lenders co agents may  and upon the written request of a specified percentage of the lender group  shall declare all commitments of the lenders under the facility terminated  declare all amounts outstanding or accrued thereunder immediately due and payable  and exercise other rights and remedies available to them under the agreement and applicable law 
collateral 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of interface  inc and its domestic subsidiaries subject to exceptions for certain immaterial subsidiaries  including all of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and up to of the stock of our first tier material foreign subsidiaries 
if an event of default occurs under the revolving credit facility  the lenders collateral agent may  upon the request of a specified percentage of lenders  exercise remedies with respect to the collateral  including  in some instances  foreclosing mortgages on real estate assets  taking possession of or selling personal property assets  collecting accounts receivables  or exercising proxies to take control of the pledged stock of domestic and first tier material foreign subsidiaries 
senior and senior subordinated notes the indentures governing our senior notes due  senior notes due  and senior subordinated notes due  on a collective basis  contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make dividend payments or other restricted payments  create liens on our assets  sell our assets  sell securities of our subsidiaries  enter into transactions with shareholders and affiliates  and enter into mergers  consolidations  or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  each of the indentures governing our senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due contains a covenant that requires us to make an offer to purchase the outstanding notes under such indenture in the event of a change of control of interface as defined in each respective indenture 
each series of notes is guaranteed  fully  unconditionally  and jointly and severally  on an unsecured basis by each of our material us subsidiaries 
if we breach or fail to perform any of the affirmative or negative covenants under one of these indentures  or if other specified events occur such as a bankruptcy or similar event  after giving effect to any applicable notice and right to cure provisions  an event of default will exist 
an event of default also will exist under each indenture if we breach or fail to perform any covenant or agreement contained in any other instrument including without limitation any other indenture relating to any of our indebtedness exceeding million or million in the case of the indenture governing our senior notes due and such default or failure results in the indebtedness becoming due and payable 
if an event of default exists and is continuing  the trustee of the series of notes at issue or the holders of at least of the principal amount of such notes may declare the principal amount of the notes and accrued interest thereon immediately due and payable except in the case of bankruptcy  in which case such amounts are immediately due and payable even in the absence of such a declaration 
in  we repurchased million of our senior notes due in  we repurchased an additional million of the senior notes 
analysis of cash flows our primary sources of cash during were million from our sale of  shares of common stock  million received from the sale of our european fabrics business  million from continuing operations  and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
the primary uses of cash during were million for repurchases of the company s senior notes  million for bond interest payments  and million for additions to property and equipment in our manufacturing locations 
our primary sources of cash during were million from continuing operations  million from discontinued operations  and million from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
the primary uses of cash during were million for additions to property and equipment at our manufacturing facilities  million for purchases of intellectual property  million for deposits on manufacturing equipment  and million for repurchases of senior notes 
our primary sources of cash during were million from continuing operations  million of net proceeds after payment of fees  expenses and the redemption amount  including accrued interest  of our senior subordinated notes due from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due  million from the sale of a building  and million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
the primary uses of cash during were million in conjunction with discontinued operations net of million cash received  million for additions to property and equipment in our manufacturing facilities  million of costs associated with the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due  million primarily for deposits on manufacturing equipment  and million related to an increase in notes receivable 
management believes that cash provided by operations and long term loan commitments will provide adequate funds for current commitments and other requirements in the foreseeable future 
cash flows from discontinued operations are included in operating cash flows for all years presented  as there were no material investing or financing activities related to these discontinued operations 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to have any significant impact on future liquidity and capital resources 
funding obligations we have various contractual obligations that we must fund as part of our normal operations 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations including the contractual obligations of our discontinued operations and the periods in which payments are due 
the amounts and time periods are measured from december  payments due by period total payments due less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations expected interest payments unconditional purchase obligations pension cash obligations total contractual cash obligations our capital lease obligations are insignificant 
expected interest payments to be made in future periods reflect anticipated interest payments related to our million of senior notes  our million of senior notes  and our million of senior subordinated notes 
we have also assumed in the presentation above that we will hold the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes until maturity 
we have excluded from the presentation interest payments and fees related to our revolving credit facility discussed above  because of the variability and timing of advances and repayments thereunder 
does not include unconditional purchase obligations that are included as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have capital expenditure commitments of million  all of which are due in less than year 
we have two foreign defined benefit plans and a domestic salary continuation plan 
we have presented above the estimated cash obligations that will be paid under these plans over the next ten years 
such amounts are based on several estimates and assumptions and could differ materially should the underlying estimates and assumptions change 
our domestic salary continuation plan is an unfunded plan  and we do not currently have any commitments to make contributions to this plan 
however  we do use insurance instruments to hedge our exposure under the salary continuation plan 
contributions to our other employee benefit plans are at our discretion 
critical accounting policies high quality financial statements require rigorous application of high quality accounting policies 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events may not develop as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
a portion of our revenues is derived from long term contracts that are accounted for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
long term fixed price contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment is indicated 
a loss is then recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the asset as estimated by management using its best judgment and the carrying value of the asset 
if actual market value is less favorable than that estimated by management  additional write downs may be required 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of sfas no 
the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretation of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
goodwill 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we use an outside consultant to help prepare valuations of reporting units  and those valuations are compared with the respective book values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists 
in preparing the valuations  past  present and expected future performance is considered 
if impairment is indicated  a loss is recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit and the book value of that goodwill 
if the actual fair value of the goodwill is determined to be less than that estimated  an additional write down may be required 
inventories 
we determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
we estimate our reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining our inventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values 
experience has shown that significant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write downs are the age of the inventory  the length of its product life cycles  anticipated demand for our products  and current economic conditions 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
our inventory reserve on december   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent that actual obsolescence of our inventory differs from our estimate by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis 
pension benefits 
net pension expense recorded is based on  among other things  assumptions about the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and salary increases 
while management believes these assumptions are reasonable  changes in these and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of our plans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year 
the actuarial assumptions used in our salary continuation plan and our foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class 
expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets  and include input from actuaries  investment service firms and investment managers 
a increase in the actuarial assumption for discount rate would decrease our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
environmental remediation 
we provide for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
we regularly monitor the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strengths of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective  and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
our allowance for doubtful accounts on december   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent the actual collectibility of our accounts receivable differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual collectibility was better or worse  respectively  than the estimated allowance 
product warranties 
we typically provide limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of our carpet products for example  warranties regarding excessive surface wear  edge ravel and static electricity for periods ranging from ten to twenty years  depending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which the product is to be installed 
we typically warrant that any services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion 
for our fabrics products  we typically provide a five year limited warranty against manufacturing defects and nonconformity to specifications 
in the event of a breach of warranty  the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product 
we record a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and periodically adjust these provisions to reflect changes in actual experience 
our warranty reserve on december   and january   was million and million  respectively 
actual warranty expense incurred could vary significantly from amounts that we estimate 
to the extent the actual warranty expense differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual expense is lower or higher  respectively  than the estimated provision 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no 
also revises provisions of sfas no 
that apply to available for sale and trading securities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is current evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements

sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize a plan s funded status in its statement of financial position  measure a plan s assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize the changes in a defined benefit post retirement plan s funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas no 
s requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and new disclosure requirements became effective for companies with fiscal years ending after december   on a prospective basis 
as a result of the requirement to recognize the unfunded status of the plan as a liability  the company recorded a charge to other comprehensive income of million in the th quarter of the impact of this statement on the company s consolidated financial statements is discussed in item of this report in the note entitled employee benefit plans 
in september  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
provides additional guidance on determining the materiality of cumulative unadjusted misstatements in both current and future financial statements 
sab no 
also provides guidance on the proper accounting and reporting for the correction of immaterial unadjusted misstatements which may become material in subsequent accounting periods 
sab no 
generally requires prior period financial statements to be revised if prior misstatements are subsequently discovered  however  for immaterial prior year revisions  reports filed under the securities exchange act of are not required to be amended 
sab no 
became effective as of december  the company applied the guidance provided in sab no 
in the fourth quarter of  and identified three matters in prior reporting periods which were deemed immaterial to those periods using a consistent evaluation methodology the rollover method 
they were as follows in  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction in which a gain was recognized at the time of sale as opposed to over the lease period 
in addition  the company did not use straight line rental accounting for the expected lease payments related to this transaction 
to correct these entries  the company recorded an entry to increase liabilities by approximately million and decrease retained earnings by approximately million  net of tax  the company s previous methodology for recording legal expenses ensured that the company incurred twelve months of expense in each year 
however  the actual timing and amount of the legal bills received led to an understated liability on the balance sheet 
the company has recorded a liability of approximately million and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately million  net of taxes as the remaining portion of these costs were capitalizable  to properly record incurred legal expenses  and the company previously under recorded the liability related to restricted stock by approximately million 
there was no impact to consolidated shareholders equity as a result of this correction  as the liability for restricted stock is recorded in equity

in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in summary  fin requires that all tax positions subject to sfas no

in the second step  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis  that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin is effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after december   with any adjustment in a company s tax provision being accounted for as a cumulative effect of accounting change in beginning equity

in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf concludes that a the scope of this issue includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  and b that the presentation of taxes within the scope on either a gross or a net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed under opinion furthermore  for taxes reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of the scope of our global operations  we are exposed to an element of market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted by this risk 
we manage our exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financial activities and  to the extent appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we employ derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
we monitor the use of derivative financial instruments through objective measurable systems  well defined market and credit risk limits  and timely reports to senior management according to prescribed guidelines 
we have established strict counter party credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions with a rating of investment grade or better 
as a result  we consider the risk of counter party default to be minimal 
interest rate market risk exposure changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on certain of our debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  our management has developed and implemented a policy to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable rate debt within certain parameters 
from time to time  we maintain a fixed variable rate mix within these parameters either by borrowing on a fixed rate basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
in the interest rate swaps  we agree to exchange  at specified levels  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal linked to libor 
foreign currency exchange market risk exposure a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  canada  england  northern ireland  the netherlands  australia and thailand  and sell our products in more than countries 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and many other currencies  including the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  thai baht and japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of anticipated sales in those currencies decreases  and vice versa 
additionally  to the extent our foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar transact business in countries other than the united states  exchange rate changes between two foreign currencies could ultimately impact us 
finally  because we report in us dollars on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position 
at december   we recognized a million increase in our foreign currency translation adjustment account compared to january   because of the strengthening of certain currencies against the us dollar 
the increase was associated primarily with certain foreign subsidiaries located within the united kingdom and continental europe 
sensitivity analysis for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the fair values of our market sensitive instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values associated with the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
the market value of instruments affected by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk is computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
the discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at december  the values that result from these computations are then compared with the market values of the financial instruments 
the differences are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
interest rate risk based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of december   a decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of million or an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of million  respectively 
as the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net foreign investments is not included in the sensitivity model  these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
