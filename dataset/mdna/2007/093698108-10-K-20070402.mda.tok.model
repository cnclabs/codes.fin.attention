part i item business introduction overview since it s founding in  blonder tongue has been an innovative designer and manufacturer of products for the cable television industry  primarily focused on the development of technology for niche cable television applications 
this focus has given the company a dominant position in the private cable market 
during the past several years the differentiation between the franchised and private cable markets has blurred due to the consumer s increased expectations for cutting edge services such as high speed data  telephony  and digital video offerings 
in response  the company has expanded its strategic thrust to accommodate both the franchised and private cable markets and is a provider of integrated network solutions to all of the cable markets that the company serves  including the multi dwelling unit mdu market  the lodging hospitality market and the institutional market which includes hospitals  prisons and schools 
the cable market has reacted quickly to consumer demands for additional services by integrating multiple technologies into their existing networks to provide consumers high speed data and telephony in addition to video offerings 
telephone companies have also entered this competitive arena by upgrading their existing distribution networks  enabling them to be able to provide video and high speed data in addition to telephony offerings 
as a result of these market forces  the lodging and institutional markets are now playing catch up in order to meet consumers expectations that these services be available  and are installing new infrastructure and upgrading existing networks 
this is a significant area of opportunity for the company to market and sell it s core product line 
most of the changes in the market segments that the company serves have recently been focused on the transition to digital technologies 
one of the most promising areas is internet protocol television iptv  an emerging technology which allows viewers to access broadcast network channels  subscriber services and movies on demand 
this technology is already experiencing full scale commercialization in international markets such as hong kong  italy and france 
the worldwide market projections are impressive with an estimated million subscribers subscribing to iptv services by the company has negotiated license agreements that will provide entry into this promising market  and is currently developing products to meet the needs of customers in the markets that it serves 
recent developments during the company has continued to advance the implementation of its current strategic plan in an effort to maximize shareholder value 
the company s strategic plan consists of the following o divesting its interests in non core business activities  o focusing on the efficient operation of its core business  o realigning its leadership structure  and o implementation of an initiative to have high volume products manufactured in the people s republic of china prc in order to substantially reduc e the company s manufacturing costs  obtain competitive advantage in the markets served and allow a more aggressive marketing program 
the company s manufacturing initiative in the prc will entail a combination of contract manufacturing agreements and purchasing agreements with key chinese manufacturers that can most fully meet the company s needs 
the company has entered into a manufacturing agreement with a major contract manufacturer in the prc that would govern the terms of its manufacture of certain of the company s high volume and complex products upon a purchase order being submitted by the company 
the company is also negotiating with other prc based contract manufacturers with respect to other products 
it is anticipated this transition will relate to products representing a significant portion of the company s net sales and will be done in phases over the next several years  with the first products transitioning within the next to months 
on december   the company completed the divesture of its wholly owned subsidiary  bdr broadband  llc bdr through the sale of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of bdr to direcpath  a joint venture between hicks holdings llc and the directv group  inc the aggregate sale price was approximately million resulting in a gain of approximately  on the sale  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
this divestiture is expected to result in annualized savings of approximately  per year 
the transaction included a long term equipment purchase commitment from direcpath 
it is also anticipated that blonder tongue will provide direcpath with certain systems engineering and technical services 
bdr commenced operations in june  when it acquired certain rights of entry for mdu cable television and high speed data systems the systems from verizon media ventures  inc and gte southwest incorporated 
as a result of bdr acquiring additional rights of entry  at the time of the divesture  bdr owned systems for approximately mdu properties in the state of texas  representing approximately  mdu cable television subscribers and  passings 
the systems were upgraded with approximately   and  of interdiction and other products of the company during  and  respectively 
during  two systems located outside of texas were sold 
while the company continued to invest in and expand bdr s business  in august the company determined to seek a buyer for bdr and exit the business of operating systems in texas to allow the company to pursue alternative strategic opportunities 
in october  several months prior to the divestiture of bdr  the company acquired the minority interest that has been owned by priority systems  llc  for nominal consideration 
on december   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  blonder tongue investment company  completed the sale of selected patents  patent applications  provisional patent applications and related foreign patents and applications patents to moonbeam llc for net proceeds of  in connection with the sale  the company has retained a non exclusive  royalty free  non sublicenseable  worldwide right and license to use the patents to continue to develop  manufacture  use  sell  distribute and otherwise exploit all of the company s products currently protected under the patents 
these products include some of the interdiction lines in the addressable subscriber category of equipment 
on june   the company completed the divesture of its ownership interest in blonder tongue telephone  llc btt 
under the terms of a share exchange and settlement agreement share exchange agreement with btt and certain related parties of btt  the company transferred to btt its membership shares of btt in exchange for btt transferring back to the company the  shares of the company s common stock that were previously contributed by the company to the capital of btt 
pursuant to the share exchange agreement  the company granted btt a non transferable equipment purchase credit in the aggregate amount of  subject to certain off sets  which was exercised in full by september  btt agreed to change its corporate name within days after closing and cease using any intellectual property of the company  including  the names blonder  blonder tongue or bt 
as part of the transaction  certain other non material agreements among btt and the company were also terminated 
the company acquired its ownership interest in btt as part of a series of agreements entered into in march and september through its ownership interest in btt  the company was involved in providing a proprietary telephone system suited to mdu development and was entitled to receive incremental revenues associated with direct sales of telephony products  however  revenues derived from sales of such telephony products and services were not material 
in addition to the company s interest in btt  the company also acquired a economic interest in netlinc communications  llc netlinc as part of the same series of agreements 
the company continues to hold its interest in netlinc  which owns patents  proprietary technology and know how for certain telephony products that allow competitive local exchange carriers clecs to competitively provide voice service to mdus 
while netlinc s intellectual property could be further developed and used in the future to manufacture and sell telephony products  the company has no present intention to do so 
on february  the effective date  the company entered into a series of agreements related to its megaport tm line of high speed data communications products 
as a result of these agreements  the company has expanded its distribution territory  favorably amended certain pricing and volume provisions and extended by years the term of the distribution agreement for its megaport tm product line 
these agreements also require the company to guaranty payment due by shenzhen junao technology company ltd 
shenzhen  an affiliate of master gain  to octalica  ltd 
octalica in connection with shenzhen s purchase of tmt third millennium technology limited tmt from octalica 
in exchange for this guaranty  megaport technology  llc megaport  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company obtained an assignable option the option to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of tmt on substantially the same terms as the acquisition of tmt by shenzhen from octalica 
the purchase price for tmt and  therefore  the amount and payment terms guaranteed by the company is the sum of  plus an earn out 
the earn out will not exceed of the net revenues derived from the sale of certain products during a period of months commencing after the sale of certain specified quantities of tmt inventory following the effective date 
the cash portion of the purchase price is payable i  on the th day following the effective date  ii  on the last day of the twenty fourth month following the effective date  and iii  commencing upon the later of a the second anniversary of the effective date and b the date after which certain volume sales targets for each of the megaport tm products have been met  and then only as and to the extent that revenues are derived from sales of such products 
in february megaport sent notice to tmt and shenzhen of its election to exercise the option to acquire substantially all of the assets of tmt 
upon consummation of the acquisition  megaport  or its assignee  will pay shenzhen  in the same manner and at the same times  cash payments equal to the purchase price payments due from shenzhen to octalica and will assume certain liabilities of tmt 
on november   the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  blonder tongue far east  llc  a delaware limited liability company  entered into a joint venture agreement jv agreement with master gain international industrial limited  a hong kong corporation master gain  intending to manufacture products in the prc 
this joint venture was formed to compete with far east manufactured products and to expand market coverage outside north america 
on june   the company terminated the jv agreement due to the joint venture s failure to meet certain quarterly financial milestones as set forth in the jv agreement 
the inability to meet such financial milestones was caused  by the failure of master gain to contribute the  of capital to the joint venture as required by the jv agreement and the joint venture s failure to obtain certain governmental approvals and licenses necessary for the operation of the joint venture 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in november and completed its initial public offering in december strategy it is a constant challenge for the company to stay at the forefront of the technological requirements of the cable markets that the company serves  including the mdu  lodging  and institutional markets 
changes and developments in the manner in which information whether video  voice or data is transmitted as well as the use of alternative compression technologies all require the company to continue to develop innovative new products 
the company has added and intends to continue to add new and innovative products to respond to the migration from analog to digital signal transmission 
in order to provide products and services that allow integrators and operators to deploy triple play services of voice  high speed data and video both analog and digital  the company has added new products to the digital video headend  high speed data and fiber optic product lines 
these key product lines are more thoroughly discussed under business products beginning on page below 
this evolution of the company s product lines will focus on the increased needs created in the digital space by iptv  digital video  and hdtv signals and integrating these signals in to the optical networks of the future 
in response to the market pressure to compete with far east manufactured products and to expand its market coverage outside north america  the company is seeking strategic contract manufacturing relationships in the prc  and has already entered into a manufacturing agreement with a major contract manufacturer in the prc for certain of its high volume and complex products 
the company believes that this initiative will reduce the manufacturing costs of its products  with resultant improvement in gross profit margins 
the company expects to commence production of products in the prc during the company s principal customers are o cable system operators both franchise and private  as well as cable contractors that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build  o lodging hospitality video and high speed data system operators that specialize in the lodging hospitality markets  and o institutional system operators that operate  upgrade and maintain the systems that are in their facilities  or contractors that install  upgrade and maintain these systems a key component of the company s strategy is to leverage its reputation across a broad product line  offering one stop shop convenience to the cable market customers it serves and delivering products having a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has historically enjoyed  and continues to enjoy  a dominant market position in the private cable industry  while progressively making inroads into the franchise cable market 
the company provides integrated network solutions for the mdu market  the lodging hospitality market and the institutional market 
as the company has expanded its market coverage  however  the distinctions between private cable and franchise cable have become blurred 
for example  the most efficient  highest revenue producing private cable systems and small franchise cable systems are built with the same electronic building blocks 
most of the electronics required for these systems are available from blonder tongue 
the company s product lines headend and distribution must continue to evolve to maintain the ability to provide all of the electronic equipment necessary to build small cable systems and much of the equipment needed in larger systems for the most efficient operation and highest profitability in high density applications 
markets overview the broadband signal distribution industry involving the high speed transmission of television  telephony and internet signals has been dominated by franchise cable television and multiple system cable operators msos 
the penetration of wireless  direct broadcast satellite dbs  such as directv tm and dish network tm  in the tv market continues to grow with a combined subscriber count in excess of million 
the regional bell operating companies ie verizon and at t  rboc s also compete with the mso s for high speed data services and are building fiber optic networks  on a national level  capable of delivering triple play services direct to the home or to the curb utilizing packet based  internet protocol technology ip 
the mso s are deploying ip for their video on demand vod services and continue to expand the reach of fiber optic networks in order to maintain their dominant position 
the long term result of these activities will be increased competition for the provision of all three services and a trend toward delivery of these services through fiber using ip technology 
this major market transition has resulted in increased consumer expectations  so that the lodging and institutional markets are under pressure to install new infrastructure and upgrade existing networks 
it is not known how long this transition will take but to remain competitive  the company must continue to increase its product offerings for fiber transmission  digital television  ip encoding and decoding and digital applications 
cable television most cable television operators  both large and small  have built fiber optic networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coaxial cable to deliver television signal programming  data  and phone services on one drop cable 
cable television deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in most existing systems 
the system architecture being employed to accomplish the provision of analog video  digital video  hdtv  high speed data  vod  and telephone service is a hybrid fiber coaxial hfc network 
in an hfc network  fiber optic trunk lines connect to nodes which typically feed to subscribers  using coaxial cable 
the company believes that most major metropolitan areas will eventually have complex networks of two or more independent operators interconnecting homes  and multi dwelling complexes 
all of these networks are potential users of blonder tongue s analog video headend  digital video headend  fiber optic  and addressable products 
lodging competition among cable operators serving the lodging market to provide more channels  vod  and enhanced interactivity  has resulted in increased demand for analog  digital and high definition television system electronics 
these systems have been and continue to be well received in the market  as property owners have sought additional revenue streams and guests have demanded increased in room technology services 
the leading system integrators in this market rely upon outside suppliers for their system electronics and most are blonder tongue customers 
these companies and others offer lodging establishments systems that provide vod movies with a large selection of titles 
the typical lodging system headend will include as many as to receivers and as many as to modulators  and will be capable of providing guests with more free channels  vod for a broad selection of movie titles  and interactive services 
most of the systems with vod service were initially in large hotels  where the economics of high channel capacity systems are more easily justified 
the conversion of hotel pay per view systems into video on demand is increasing 
smaller hotels and motels are being provided with video on demand as enhanced technology results in reduced headend costs  keeping the market growth reasonably steady 
a current trend in lodging is to provide plug and play high speed data service to customers and blonder tongue s megaport tm high speed data product is an ideal solution for hotel motel high speed data deployment 
institutional the company identifies the institutional market as education campus environments  correctional facilities and short or long term health service environments 
what all of these seemingly unrelated facilities have in common is that they all contain private networks that are dependant on either locally generated or externally sourced video and or data content 
as the advanced technologies of vod  hdtv  and iptv permeate the market  these facilities are embracing these technologies to achieve site specific goals 
the company has traditionally benefited from a very strong share of this market with its analog video headend and distribution products 
we anticipate that this trend will continue and evolve into firm adoption of our digital video headend products  which include hdtv and digital video solutions and our upcoming iptv platforms 
international cable television service for much of the world is expanding as technological advancement reduces the cost to consumers 
in addition  economic development in latin america  asia and eastern europe has allowed construction of integrated delivery systems that utilize a variety of electronics and broadband hardware 
the pace of growth is difficult to predict  but as more alternatives become available and television service becomes increasingly affordable  it is anticipated that more equipment will be placed in the field 
the company utilizes several distributors in florida and within latin america to serve the latin american market  although during the last several years international sales have not materially contributed to the company s revenue base 
the company s initiative to manufacture products in the prc will expand the company s capability to manufacture core products at a more competitive cost and also could lead to the development of new markets for product sales in the far east 
in connection with any expansion  however  there are inherent risks of international operations in general  and operating in the prc in particular 
these risks are described in more detail under risk factors below 
additional considerations the technological revolution with respect to video  data and voice services continues at a rapid pace 
cable tv s qam video is competing with directv tm and echostar s dbs service and cable modems compete with dsl offered by the rboc s 
rboc s are building national fiber networks and are now delivering video  data and voice services directly to the home over fiber optic cable  and voice over ip voip is being offered by cable companies and others in competition with traditional phone companies 
the company is also beginning to see the convergence of data and video communications  wherein computer and television systems merge 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty which technology will be dominant at any particular point in time  the company believes that delivery of services using ip technology will eventually dominate the delivery systems of the future and the tremendous bandwidth available through the use of fiber optic cable will eventually be the dominant carrier of video  voice and data communications signals 
since the installed base of united states television sets are for the most part analog not digital  direct satellite television  digitally compressed programming and ip delivery requires headend products or set top decoding receivers or converters to convert the transmitted signals back to analog 
the replacement of all television sets with digital sets will be costly and take many years to complete 
the company believes that for many years to come  program providers will deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set 
products blonder tongue s products can be separated  according to function  into the several categories described below o analog video headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation for further transmission 
among the products offered by the company in this category are satellite receivers  integrated receiver decoders  demodulators  modulators  antennas and antenna mounts  amplifiers  equalizers  and processors 
the headend is the brain of a television signal distribution system 
it is the central location where the multi channel signal is initially received  converted and allocated to specific channels for analog distribution 
in some cases  where the signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed  a receiver will also be required to decode the signal 
blonder tongue is a licensee of motorola  inc s motorola videocipher r and digicipher r encryption technologies and integrates their decoders into integrated receiver decoder products  where required 
the company estimates that analog video headend products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in o digital video headend products used by a system operator for acquisition  processing and manipulation of digital video signals 
blonder tongue is constantly expanding its digital products offering  which currently includes the qtm line of transcoders  digital qam up converters for data over cable applications  digital high definition television processors for delivery of hdtv programming and qam modulators 
the qtm line is used for economically deploying or adding a satellite based digital programming tier of standard digital or hdtv digital programming 
the unit transcodes a satellite signal s modulation from quadrature phase shift key qpsk to quadrature amplitude modulation qam or from psk hdtv format to qam for signals received from a satellite transponder 
since qpsk and psk are optimum for satellite transmission and qam is optimum for fiber coaxial distribution  precious system bandwidth is saved while the signal maintains its digital form 
building upon the innovative design work that brought about the qtm transcoders  qam up converters  and hdtv processors  the company launched the aqd series of agile qam demodulators 
the aqd series allows for the reception and demodulation of qam digital  off air standard digital or off air hdtv signals 
this enables system operators in all of the company s primary markets to benefit from digital transmission  while preserving their analog distribution networks and viewing sites long after the fcc mandatory transition in digital video headend products continue to expand in all of the company s primary markets  bringing more advanced technology to consumers and operators  and it is expected that this area will evolve in to a major element of the company s business in the future 
the company estimates that digital video headend products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in o fiber products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using fiber optic cable 
among the products offered are optical transmitters  receivers  couplers and splitters 
these products convert rf frequencies to light or infrared frequencies and launch them on optical fiber 
at each receiver site  an optical receiver is used to convert the signals back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers 
while sales of products in this category have not historically contributed significantly to the company s revenues  they are expected to increase due to recent new product innovations that the company will be bringing to market 
o distribution products used to permit signals to travel from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home  apartment unit  hotel room  office or other terminal location along a distribution network of fiber optic or coaxial cable 
among the products offered by the company in this category are line extenders  broadband amplifiers  directional taps  splitters and wall taps 
in cable television systems  the distribution products are either mounted on exterior telephone poles or encased in pedestals  vaults or other security devices 
in private cable systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building if a single structure or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coaxial cable and devices 
the non passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio video images 
the company estimates that distribution products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in o addressable products used to control access to programming at the subscriber s location 
the products offered in this category are interdiction and addressable multi tap amt products 
interdiction products limit the availability of programs to subscribers through jamming of particular channels 
recently  the company introduced a consumer version of this product  the tv channel blocker parental control  which provides local at the consumer level control of the full analog block of channels 
amt products remotely control all access to programming for a particular subscriber 
sales of these products have not contributed significantly to the company s revenues 
o high speed data products used to provide internet access and transfer data over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable system 
products in this category include standard docsis cable modems  docsis euro docsis cable modem termination system cmts  and the megaport tm solution for providing broadband internet access to hospitality environments mdus 
the megaport tm solution consists of two main components  the gateway and the intelligent outlets 
the gateway is a broadband ethernet router or bridge that establishes a network within a building or community over the existing coaxial cable system 
the intelligent outlet serves as the modem  but is permanently installed in the location to eliminate loss of equipment associated with churn 
each gateway can accommodate enabled outlets and with a software upgrade  up to outlets 
on february   the company entered in to a non exclusive distribution agreement with motorola  inc for the sales and distribution of motorola s connected home solutions voice and data products to the private cable  lodging and institutional markets in the united states 
products feature the industry leading motorola surfboard r cable modem and the bsr broadband services router compact cmts featuring docsis r qualification 
the bsr is a compact  high performance cmts with downstream and upstream channels that is ideal for small or medium sized distribution systems 
the unit offers advanced functionality  allowing smaller cable operators to efficiently migrate to docsis or eurodocsis while simultaneously increasing the performance of their existing base of docsis and cable modems 
this is a relatively new category of products for the company and has not as yet contributed significantly to the company s revenues 
o telephony products used to provide expanded telephone service to mdu subscribers 
these products are designed to offer carrier class telephone service to residences using existing twisted pair wires 
service will be fully transparent to subscribers with advanced calling features such as  caller id  call waiting plus  and three way calling available and bundled at a flat rate to subscribers 
the existing twisted pair telephone wiring infrastructure is utilized to provide dial tone at a resident s premises using any standard telephone 
the company does not have a significant history of sales of telephony products  having only acquired the distribution rights in in connection with its past venture efforts in btt 
sales volume has been lower than originally anticipated and the recent divesture by the company of its interest in btt is likely to further diminish the company s sales prospects for these products 
it is not presently anticipated that sales of telephony products will become a significant source of revenue for the company 
o microwave products used to transmit voice  analog video  digital video  and data signals to multiple locations using point to point communication links in the ghz range of frequencies 
the company offers the full line of products required to construct and maintain these point to point  ghz communication links 
while microwave products will continue to be sold to maintain existing systems  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
o test products used for measuring signals in the headend and distribution 
among the products offered by the company in this category are analog and digital qpsk analyzers  palm tops analog and digital analyzers and signal level meters 
while the company expects to continue selling test products to meet the needs of customers  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
the company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements 
typically  these modifications are minor and do not materially alter the functionality of the products 
thus  the inability of the customer to accept such products does not generally result in the company being otherwise unable to sell such products to other customers 
research and product development the markets served by blonder tongue are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete effectively in this environment  the company must engage in ongoing research and development in order to i create new products  ii expand the frequency range of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater channel capacity  iii license new technology  and iv acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources 
research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the company s customers and customer prospects with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders from such customers or customer prospects 
in the new product development process  the vast experience of the company s technical services group is leveraged to ensure the highest level of suitability and widest acceptance to the marketplace 
products tend to be developed in a functional building block approach that allows for different combinations of blocks to generate new relevant products if the market demands 
additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and engineering lower production costs 
for the acquisition of new technologies  the company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties 
the company will also license technology if it can obtain technology quicker  or more cost effectively from third parties than it could otherwise develop on its own  or if the desired technology is proprietary to a third party 
there were employees in the research and development department of the company at december  the company spent   and  on research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
marketing and sales blonder tongue markets and sells its products worldwide primarily to the following markets the mdu market  the lodging market and the institutional market 
sales are made directly to customers by the company s internal sales force  as well as through a few domestic stocking distributors which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal 
these distributors serve multiple markets 
direct sales to cable operators and system integrators accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal the company s sales and marketing function is predominantly performed by its internal sales force 
should it be deemed necessary  the company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects or target market opportunities 
the company s internal sales force consists of employees  which currently includes salespersons in old bridge  new jersey  one salesperson in each of north myrtle beach  south carolina  cudahy  wisconsin  austin  tx and santa margarita  ca and sales support personnel at the company headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s standard customer payment terms are  net days 
from time to time  when circumstances warrant  such as a commitment to a large blanket purchase order  the company will extend payment terms beyond its standard payment terms 
the company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products 
blonder tongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences 
the company also publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals  distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of blonder tongue s products and technology by editors of trade journals 
the company provides system design engineering for its customers  maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one on one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers 
blonder tongue supplies sales and applications support  product literature and training to its sales representatives and distributors 
the management of the company travels extensively  identifying customer needs and meeting potential customers 
the company had approximately  in purchase orders as of december  and approximately  in purchase orders as of december  all outstanding purchase orders as of december  are expected to be shipped prior to december  these purchase orders are for the future delivery of products and are subject to cancellation by the customers 
customers blonder tongue has a broad customer base  which in consisted of approximately active accounts 
approximately   and of the company s revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in  and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately  and respectively of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these entities  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  the company anticipates that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
the company believes that many integrators will grow rapidly  and as such the company s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on the company s ability to maintain its position in the overall marketplace by shifting its emphasis to those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental united states  however  the company also derives revenues from customers outside the continental united states  primarily in canada and to a more limited extent  in underdeveloped countries 
television service is less developed in many international markets  particularly latin america  eastern europe  and asia  creating opportunity for those participants who offer quality products at a competitive price 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and respectively 
all of the company s transactions with customers located outside of the continental united states are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has no material foreign currency transactions 
in connection with the company s anticipated initiatives in the prc  the company may have foreign currency transactions and may be subject to various currency exchange control programs related to its prc operations 
see risk factors below for more detail on the risk of foreign operations 
manufacturing and suppliers blonder tongue s manufacturing operations are presently located at the company s headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the assembly and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies 
management continues to implement a significant number of changes to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost  including logistics modifications on the factory floor  an increased use of surface mount  axial lead and radial lead robotics to place electronic components on printed circuit boards  a continuing program of circuit board redesign to make more products compatible with robotic insertion equipment and an increased integration in machining and fabrication 
all of these efforts are consistent with and part of the company s strategy to provide its customers with high performance to cost ratio products 
the company has also entered into a manufacturing agreement with a major contract manufacturer in the prc that would govern the terms of its manufacture of certain of the company s high volume and complex products upon a purchase order being submitted by the company 
the company is also negotiating with other prc based contract manufacturers with respect to other products 
the company expects to commence production of certain products in the prc during if successful  the company may shift a material portion of its manufacturing operations to the prc in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiencies 
outside contractors supply standard components  etch printed circuit boards and electronic subassemblies to the company s specifications 
while the company generally purchases electronic parts which do not have a unique source  certain electronic component parts used within the company s products are available from a limited number of suppliers and can be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts 
if the company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part  the company believes that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented 
however  in such situations the company may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the component shortage 
on an as needed basis  the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as the digicipher r encryption systems manufactured by motorola  which are standard encryption methodologies employed on us c band and ku band transponders  echostar digital receivers for delivery of dish network tm programming  and hughes digital satellite receivers for delivery of directv tm programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of certain of these components would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company does not have an agreement with any sole source supplier requiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the company 
blonder tongue maintains a quality assurance program which tests samples of component parts purchased  as well as its finished products  on an ongoing basis 
the company also tests component and sub assembly boards throughout the manufacturing process using commercially available and in house built testing systems that incorporate proprietary procedures 
the highest level of quality assurance is maintained through out all aspects of the design and manufacturing process because of the in house calibration program 
this program ensures that all test and measurement equipment that is used in the manufacturing process is calibrated to the same in house reference standard on a consistent basis 
when all test and measurement devices are calibrated in this manner  discrepancies are eliminated between the engineering  manufacturing  and quality control departments  thus increasing operational efficiency and ensuring a high level of product quality 
blonder tongue performs final product tests prior to shipment to customers 
competition all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than blonder tongue which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than blonder tongue 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could result in price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders 
the principal methods of competition are product differentiation  performance  quality  price  terms  service  technical support and administrative support 
the company believes it differentiates itself from competitors by continuously offering innovative products  providing excellent technical service support and delivering a high performance to cost ratio 
intellectual property the company currently holds united states patents and foreign patents none of which are considered material to the company s present operations because they do not relate to high volume applications 
in december  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  blonder tongue investment company  completed the sale to moonbeam llc of a portfolio of selected patents  patent applications  provisional patent applications and related foreign patents and applications patents originally acquired in the company s acquisition of scientific atlanta  inc s interdiction business in blonder tongue retained a non exclusive  royalty free  non sublicenseable  worldwide right and license to use the patents to continue to develop  manufacture  use  sell  distribute and otherwise exploit all of the company s products currently protected under the patents 
because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cable television industry  the company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous stream of new products which are designed to meet its customers needs and which have a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has a registered trademark on blonder tongue r and also on a bt r logo 
in connection with the transactions pursuant to which the company acquired an ownership interest in netlinc and btt  the company granted btt a non exclusive  revocable and royalty free license to use these trademarks and certain variations of such names 
this license was terminated as part of the transaction in which the company divested its interest in btt 
the company is a licensee of philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate  philips broadband networks  inc  motorola  hughes and several smaller software development companies 
under the philips license agreements  the company is granted a non exclusive license for a term which expires in  concurrently with the last to expire of the relevant patents 
the philips license agreements provide for the payment by the company of a one time license fee and for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
the company is a licensee of motorola relating to motorola s videocipher r encryption technology and is also a party to a private label agreement with motorola relating to its digicipher r technology 
under the videocipher r license agreement  the company is granted a non exclusive license under certain proprietary know how  to design and manufacture certain licensed products to be compatible with the videocipher r commercial descrambler module 
the videocipher r license agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
the videocipher r license agreement also provides for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
under the digicipher r private label agreement  the company is granted the non exclusive right to sell digicipher r ii integrated receiver decoders bearing the blonder tongue name for use in the commercial market 
the digicipher r private label agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
during  the company entered into several software development and license agreements for specifically designed controller and interface software necessary for the operation of the company s video central tm remote interdiction control system  which is used for remote operation of videomask tm signal jammers installed at subscriber locations 
these licenses are perpetual and require the payment of a one time license fee and in one case additional payments  the aggregate of which are not material 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technologies and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know how independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the company s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share 
the company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position 
regulation private cable  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
franchise cable operators had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
in june   the fcc adopted and issued a final rule and order relating to the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services 
the final rules regarding this issue provided for the grandfathering  for a period of ten years  of certain pre existing installed terrestrial fixed service operators tfsos and tfsos that had made application for a license prior to a certain date 
in november  the fcc issued a second order on reconsideration the second order  which redefined the use of the ghz microwave band 
as a result of the second order  the company s existing microwave inventory would have to be modified to function within the new frequency band 
in addition  on april   the fcc international bureau released a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm  docket  which among other things  proposes channelization changes for the ghz band to further reduce the usable band 
the uncertainty associated with these regulatory issues  coupled with the expanding use of fiber optic cable due to its inherently superior bandwidth  have resulted in a significant shift away from microwave products 
these products are not anticipated to be a material portion of the company s future sales 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
the company did not incur in and does not anticipate incurring in material capital expenditures for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company presently holds a permit from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep  division of environmental quality  air pollution control program relating to its operation of certain process equipment  which permit expires in may  the company has held such a permit for this equipment on a substantially continuous basis since approximately april  the company also has authorization under the new jersey pollution discharge elimination system discharge to surface waters general industrial stormwater permit  permit no 
nj this permit will expire may  employees as of march   the company employed approximately people  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in a general and administrative capacity 
of the company s employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local  which has a three year labor agreement with the company expiring in february  the company considers its relations with its employees to be good 
item a risk factors the company s business operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following risk factors highlights some of these risks 
additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company now deems immaterial may also affect the company and the value of its common stock 
the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this report  should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
solely for purposes of the risk factors in this item a  the terms we  our and us refer to blonder tongue laboratories  inc and its subsidiaries 
any substantial decrease in sales to our largest customer may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in  and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to this customer will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  we anticipate that this customer will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods  although it is not obligated to purchase any specified amount of products beyond outstanding purchase orders or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
we believe that many integrators will grow rapidly  and  as such  our success will depend in part on o the viability of those customers  o our ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects  and o our ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such customers 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or our inability to develop solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to reduce expenses or increase of revenues may cause continued net losses 
we have had net losses from continuing operations each year since while management believes its plans to reduce expenses and increase revenues will return us to profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
failure to reduce expenses or increase revenues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant increase to inventory reserves due to inadequate reserves in a prior period or to an increase in excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we continually analyze our slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices  we establish reserves 
if we do not meet our sales expectations  these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
we recorded an increase to our reserve of   and  during  and  respectively 
although we believe reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value  there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future 
significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to develop  or acquire the rights to  technology  products or applications in response to changes in industry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability 
both the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to be successful  we must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs  through the timely development and introduction of new products  enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties 
although we depend primarily on our own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products  we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when we believe that we can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own  or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party 
there can  however  be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that o we will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the communications industry generally  o we will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs  o technologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed  or o successfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
anticipated increases in direct and indirect competition with us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than us  which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we have 
we expect that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition through o price reductions  o loss of market share  o delays in the timing of customer orders  and o an inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market 
our sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by the cable infrastructure operators that we serve in the mdu  lodging and institutional cable markets 
the vast majority of our revenues in fiscal years  and came from sales of our products for use by cable infrastructure operators 
demand for our products depends to a large extent upon capital spending on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
capital spending by private cable operators and  therefore  our sales and profitability  are dependent on a variety of factors  including o access by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures  o demand for their cable services  o availability of alternative video delivery technologies  and o general economic conditions 
in addition  our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over build existing cable system infrastructures  or constructing  rebuilding  maintaining and upgrading their systems 
there can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining  or upgrading their systems 
any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any significant casualty to our facility in old bridge  new jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our business operations 
we operate out of one manufacturing facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility 
while we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance  a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of the ability to manufacture at  or otherwise use  that facility would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not otherwise available or to do so only at increased prices 
we purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as certain components of echostar s digital satellite receiver decoders  which are specifically designed to work with the dish network tm  and certain components of hughes network systems digital satellite receivers which are specifically designed to work with directv r programming 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by o an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components  o our receipt of a significant number of defective components  o an increase in component prices  or o our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of our products 
our existing and proposed international sales and operations subject us to the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in foreign telecommunications standards  and unfavorable political  regulatory  labor and tax conditions in other countries 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
such sales are subject to certain risks such as o changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  o export license requirements  o tariffs and taxes  o other trade barriers  o capital and exchange control programs  o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and o political and economic instability 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
there can be no assurance that sales to customers outside the united states will reach or exceed historical levels in the future  or that international markets will continue to develop or that we will receive additional contracts to supply our products for use in systems and equipment in international markets 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if international markets do not continue to develop  we do not continue to receive additional contracts to supply our products for use in systems and equipment in international markets or our international sales are affected by the other risks of international operations 
our anticipated contract manufacturing in the prc may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political  regulatory  legal and labor conditions in the prc 
during the second half of  we expect to begin manufacturing and assembling some of our products in the people s republic of china  or prc  under contract manufacturing arrangements with certain key chinese manufacturers 
in addition  we may increase the amount of revenues we derive from sales to customers outside the united states  including sales in the prc 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to  or any other problems arising from  having our products manufactured in the prc  including those risks described in the preceding risk factor 
although the prc has a large and growing economy  its potential economic  political  legal and labor developments entail uncertainties and risks 
in the event of any changes that adversely affect our ability to manufacture in the prc after products have been successfully transitioned out of the united states  our business will suffer 
shifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense 
over time we may shift a material portion of our manufacturing operations to the prc in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiency 
this could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future  which in turn could entail significant one time earnings charges to account for severance  equipment write offs or write downs and moving expenses 
competitors may develop products that are similar to  and compete with  our products due to our limited proprietary protection 
we possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to our technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know how 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with our products 
such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
patent infringement claims against us or our customers  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant costs 
while we do not believe that our products including products and technologies licensed from others infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted against us or our customers 
damages for violation of third party proprietary rights could be substantial  in some instances damages are trebled  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims  we would incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances  a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to obtain a license to a third party s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental regulation of the cable markets that we serve  including the mdu  lodging and institutional markets  may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the mdu  lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry  which represents the vast majority of our business  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on these cable markets resulting in  among other things  barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures 
any such regulations  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
operators in the franchise cable market  which represents a relatively small percentage of our business  had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of has deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and has opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted which would re impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in  among other things  the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas 
in addition  certain rules adopted by the fcc in june  as further revised in and provide for the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services  which rules have shifted demand away from our microwave products 
any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental environmental regulations or our inability or failure to comply with existing environmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
we do not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us 
further  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations 
any failure by us to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
losing the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees  or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees  could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key executives and technical and management personnel  including james a 
luksch  chief executive officer  and robert j 
palle  president and chief operating officer 
we maintain and are the beneficiary of  of key man life insurance on each of mr 
luksch and mr 
palle 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  manufacturing  marketing and managerial personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our organizational documents and delaware state law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation o eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting  o does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors  o does not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings  o provides for a classified board of directors  and o imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to affect certain corporate actions 
these provisions and the board s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire our company  preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock  or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company 
we are also afforded the protection of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could o delay or prevent a change in control of our company  o impede a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving us  or o discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
any of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
it is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our loan agreement with national city business credit prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our common stock 
potential fluctuations in the stock price for our common stock may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
factors such as o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  o quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  o failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community s expectations  and o market conditions for cable industry stocks in general  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
delays or difficulties in negotiating a labor agreement may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations 
all of our direct labor employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local  under a collective bargaining agreement  which expires in february delays or difficulties in negotiating and executing a new agreement  which may result in work stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
item properties the company s principal manufacturing  engineering  sales and administrative facilities consist of one building totaling approximately  square feet located on approximately acres of land in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility which is owned by the company 
the old bridge facility is encumbered by a mortgage held by national city business credit  inc in the principal amount of  as of december  management believes that the old bridge facility is adequate to support the company s anticipated needs in item legal proceedings the company is a party to certain proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business  none of which  in the current opinion of management  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

the aggregate purchase price consisted of i the cash portion of  plus ii  shares of the company s common stock 
btt had an obligation to redeem the  cash component of the purchase price to the company via preferential distributions of cash flow under btt s limited liability company operating agreement 
in addition  of the  shares of common stock issued to btt as the non cash component of the purchase price fair valued at  one half  shares were pledged to the company as collateral 
through its ownership interest in btt  the company was involved in providing a proprietary telephone system suited to mdu development and was entitled to receive incremental revenues associated with direct sales of telephony products  however  revenues derived from sales of such telephony products and services were not material 
netlinc owns patents  proprietary technology and know how for certain telephony products that allow competitive local exchange carriers clecs to competitively provide voice service to mdus

inventories that are not anticipated to be sold in the next twelve months  have been classified as non current

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from customers to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances 
management s estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowances and net earnings 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management assumptions  these allowances may need to be adjusted in the future 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value may be impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
if impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the long lived asset 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each long lived asset are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties

new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at a fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
the fasb has indicated it believes that sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
management is in the process of evaluating this pronouncement

fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists
