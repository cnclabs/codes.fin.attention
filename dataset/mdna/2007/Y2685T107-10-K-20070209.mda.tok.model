item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a marshall islands company incorporated in september to transport iron ore  coal  grain  steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels 
as of december   excluding the genco glory  our fleet consisted of seven panamax  seven handymax and five handysize drybulk carriers  with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt  and the average age of our fleet was approximately years as of december   as compared to the average age for the world fleet of approximately years for the drybulk shipping segments in which we compete 
all of the vessels in our fleet are on time charters to reputable charterers  including lauritzen bulkers  cargill  hmmc  bhp  ds norden  a s klaveness  cosco bulk carrier co  ltd  and nyk europe 
all of the vessels in our fleet are presently engaged under time charter contracts that expire assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised between march and december each vessel in our fleet was delivered to us on the date specified in the following chart vessel acquired date delivered class year built genco reliance handysize genco glory handymax genco vigour panamax genco explorer handysize genco carrier handymax genco sugar handysize genco pioneer handysize genco progress handysize genco wisdom handymax genco success handymax genco beauty panamax genco knight panamax genco leader panamax genco marine handymax genco prosperity handymax genco trader panamax genco muse handymax genco commander handymax genco acheron panamax genco surprise panamax we reached an agreement to sell the vessel to cloud maritime sa the delivery of the vessel to the new owner is expected to occur during february we intend to grow our fleet through timely and selective acquisitions of vessels in a manner that is accretive to our cash flow 
in connection with this growth strategy  we negotiated the new credit facility  which has been used to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under our previous credit facility the original credit facility remaining after application of a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering on july  our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet 
commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels  managing the mix of various types of charters  such as time charters and voyage charters  and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters 
strategic management includes locating  purchasing  financing and selling vessels 
we currently contract with three independent technical managers  to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in house 
technical management involves the day to day management of vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
members of our new york city based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers 
factors affecting our results of operations we believe that the following table reflects important measures for analyzing trends in our results of operations 
the table reflects our ownership days  available days  operating days  fleet utilization  tce rates and daily vessel operating expenses for the years ended december  and and the period from inception september  to december  because predominately all of our vessels have operated on time charters  our tce rates equal our time charter rates less voyage expenses consisting primarily of brokerage commissions paid by us to third parties 
for the years ended december  for the period from september  to december  fleet data ownership days panamax handymax handysize total available days panamax handymax handysize total operating days panamax handymax handysize total fleet utilization panamax handymax handysize fleet average for the years ended december  for the period from september  to december  us dollars average daily results time charter equivalent panamax handymax handysize fleet average daily vessel operating expenses panamax handymax handysize fleet average we define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us 
ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
we define tce rates as net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts 
for the years ended december  for the period from september  to december  income statement data us dollars in thousands voyage revenues voyage expenses net voyage revenue we define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance excluding drydocking  the costs of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses 
daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period 
operating data the following discusses our operating income and net income for the years ended december  and and the period from inception september  to december  for the years ended december  for the period from september  to december  income statement data us dollars in thousands except for per share amounts revenues operating expenses voyage expenses vessel operating expenses general and administrative expenses management fees depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other expense net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted dividends declared and paid per share weighted average common shares outstanding basic weighted average common shares outstanding diluted balance sheet data us dollars in thousands  at end of period cash total assets total debt current and long term total shareholders equity cash flow data us dollars in thousands net cash flow provided by operating activities net cash flow used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities ebitda ebitda represents net income plus net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization  plus amortization of nonvested stock compensation  and amortization of the value of time charters acquired which is included as a component of other long term assets 
ebitda is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance 
ebitda is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers 
our management uses ebitda as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings 
ebitda is also used by our lenders in certain loan covenants 
for these reasons  we believe that ebitda is a useful measure to present to our investors 
ebitda is not an item recognized by us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other indicator of a company s operating performance required by us gaap 
ebitda is not a source of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
the definition of ebitda used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies 
the following table demonstrates our calculation of ebitda and provides a reconciliation of ebitda to net income for each of the periods presented above for the years ended december  for the period from september  to december  us dollars in thousands except for per share amounts net income net interest expense amortization of value of time charter acquired amortization of nonvested stock compensation depreciation and amortization ebitda amortization of value of time charter acquired is a reduction of revenue and the unamortized portion is included in other long term assets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet  the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of daily charterhire that our vessels earn  that  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  including the duration of our charters  our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals  the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels  the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs  maintenance and upgrade work  the age  condition and specifications of our vessels  levels of supply and demand in the drybulk shipping industry  and other factors affecting spot market charter rates for drybulk carriers 
we were incorporated on september  and took delivery of our first six vessels in december the next ten vessels of our fleet were delivered in the first six months of  another vessel was delivered in october  and the last three vessels in the fleet were delivered in the fourth quarter of during february  we expect to complete the pending sale of the genco glory to cloud maritime sa for million 
the increase in the size of our fleet has enabled us to grow our revenues significantly and to increase our ownership  available and operating days 
for the year ended december   revenues grew to million versus million for the year ended december  revenues in both periods consisted of charterhire payments for our vessels 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to the operation of a larger fleet 
the average tce rate of our fleet declined by to  a day for the year ended december  from  a day for the year ended december  mostly due to lower charter rates achieved on the five handysize vessels on time charter to lauritzen bulkers 
the five vessels were renewed under a time charter with lauritzen bulkers in the third quarter of at a lower charter rate than the previous time charter 
furthermore  lower charter rates were realized on the genco leader  which was subject to lower overall spot market in versus for the years ended december  and  we had ownership days of  days and  days  respectively 
fleet utilization remained static at in versus in  respectively

in a time charter  the charterer is responsible for voyage expenses such as bunkers  port expenses  agents fees and canal dues 
the charter expiration dates presented represent the earliest dates that our charters may be terminated in the ordinary course 
under the terms of each contract  the charterer is entitled to extend time charters from two to four months in order to complete the vessel s final voyage plus any time the vessel has been off hire 
the genco leader and the genco trader were delivered to the charterer for the commencement of the time charter on january  and december   respectively 
for each of these vessels  the time charter rate presented is the net daily charterhire rate 
there are no payments of brokerage commissions associated with these time charters 
we have reached an agreement to commence a time charter for to months at a rate of  per day  less a third party brokerage commission 
the estimated charter expiration is based on the time charter beginning in march  the earliest possible termination of the previous charter 
the estimated charter expiration is based on the time charter beginning in march  the earliest possible termination of the previous charter 
the time charter rate was  until march and  thereafter until march for purposes of revenue recognition  the time charter contract through march is reflected on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or us gaap 
additionally  we have reached an agreement with the current charterer for an additional to months at a rate of  per day  less a third party brokerage commission 
since this vessel was acquired with an existing time charter at an above market rate  we allocated the purchase price between the vessel and an intangible asset for the value assigned to the above market charterhire 
this intangible asset is amortized as a reduction to voyage revenues over the remaining term of the charter  resulting in a daily rate of approximately  recognized as revenues 
for cash flow purposes  we will continue to receive  per day until the charter expires 
voyage expenses voyage expenses include port and canal charges  fuel bunker expenses and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated parties 
port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner 
for the years ended and  we did not incur port and canal charges or any significant expenses related to the consumption of bunkers as part of our vessels overall expenses  because all of our vessels were employed under time charters that require the charterer to bear all of those expenses 
as is common in the shipping industry  we pay brokerage commissions ranging from to of the total daily charterhire rate of each charter to brokers involved with arranging the charter 
we believe that the amounts and the structures of our commissions are consistent with industry practices 
for the years ended december  and  voyage expenses were million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of brokerage commissions paid to third parties 
vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance  the cost of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses 
for the years ended december  and  vessel operating expenses were million and million  respectively 
the increase in vessel operating expenses year over year was due mostly to the fact that our operations had not fully ramped up in and our fleet expanded to an average of vessels for the year ended december  as compared to an average of vessels for the year ended december  the average daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet were  and  per day for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as was our initial period of operations for the majority of our fleet  we believe the year ended december  is more reflective of our daily vessel operating expenses 
we believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation 
based on management s estimates and budgets provided by our technical managers  we expect our vessels to have daily vessel operating expenses during of vessel type average daily budgeted amount panamax handymax handysize our vessel operating expenses  which generally represent fixed costs  will increase as a result of the expansion of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for crewing  lubricants and insurance  may also cause these expenses to increase 
general and administrative expenses we incur general and administrative expenses  including our onshore vessel related expenses such as legal and professional expenses 
our general and administrative expenses also include our payroll expenses  including those relating to our executive officers  and rent 
for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the expansion of our fleet and the costs associated with running a public company for a full twelve month period  including the preparation of disclosure documents  legal and accounting costs  incremental director and officer liability insurance costs  incremental director and employee compensation  and costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of additionally  management expects general and administrative expenses to increase  mainly due to increases associated with broad based cash and non cash compensation and costs associated with the planned offering of shares owned by fleet acquisition llc 
see note in item of this report describing the offering 
management fees we incur management fees to third party technical management companies that include such services as the day to day management of our vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
for the years ended december  and  management fees were million and million  respectively 
technical management fees are paid to our independent ship managers 
income from derivative instruments for the year ended december   income from derivative instruments was million and is due solely to the gain in value during the time the and swaps had not been designated against our debt 
for the year ended december   we had no derivative instruments in place that resulted in income from derivative instruments 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value 
we estimate the useful life of our vessels to be years  which we believe is common in the drybulk shipping industry 
furthermore  we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon per lightweight ton  which we believe is standard in the drybulk shipping industry 
for the years ended december  and  depreciation and amortization charges were million and million  respectively 
the increase primarily was due to the growth in our fleet to an average of vessels for the year ended december  as compared to an average of vessels for the year ended december  net interest expense for the years ended december  and  net interest expense was million and million  respectively 
net interest expense consisted mostly of interest payments made under our new credit facility for the period 
for the period  net interest expense consisted mostly of interest payments made under our original credit facility and the new credit facility 
additionally  interest income as well as amortization of deferred financing costs related to our credit facilities is included in both periods 
the decrease in net interest expense for versus was mostly a result of a charge of million in which is associated with the write down of unamortized deferred bank charges related to our original credit facility  lower interest margin and a lower debt outstanding under our new credit facility 
year ended december  as compared to the period september  date of inception through december  for the purpose of discussing the results of our operations  we present results for the year ended december  and the period ended december   but do not compare the two periods due to the short period of operations of the fleet in in presenting the results for  we refer to the period september through december revenues we were incorporated on september  and took delivery of our first six vessels in december the next ten vessels of our fleet were delivered in the first six months of and the genco muse was delivered in october the increase in the size of our fleet has enabled us to grow our revenues significantly and to increase our ownership  available and operating days 
for the year ended december  and the period ended december  revenues were million and million  respectively  and consisted of charter payments for our vessels 
the average tce rate of our fleet for the year ended december  and the period ended december  were  a day and  a day  respectively

net interest expense consisted of interest payments made under our original credit facility  our new credit facility  interest income  as well as a charge of million associated with the write down of unamortized deferred financing costs related to our original credit facility which occurred during the third quarter liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our capital requirements with cash flow from operations  equity contributions and bank debt 
we have used our funds primarily to fund vessel acquisitions  regulatory compliance expenditures  the repayment of bank debt and the associated interest expense and the payment of dividends 
we will require capital to fund ongoing operations  acquisitions and debt service 
we expect to rely on operating cash flows as well as long term borrowings to implement our growth plan and continue our dividend policy 
we anticipate that internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our new credit facility will be sufficient to fund the operations of our fleet  including our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
dividend policy our dividend policy is to declare quarterly distributions to shareholders by each february  may  august and november  which commenced in november  substantially equal to our available cash from operations during the previous quarter  less cash expenses for that quarter principally vessel operating expenses and debt service and any reserves our board of directors determines we should maintain 
these reserves may cover  among other things  drydocking  repairs  claims  liabilities and other obligations  interest expense and debt amortization  acquisitions of additional assets and working capital

the dividends were paid on november   august   may   march   and november   to shareholders of record as of november   august   may   february   and november   respectively 
the aggregate amount of the dividend paid in the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  which we funded from cash on hand 
however  in the future  we may incur other expenses or liabilities that would reduce or eliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends 
additionally  on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share  to be paid on or about march  to shareholders of record as of february  our target rate for quarterly dividends for is  although actual dividends  if declared  may be more or less 
the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
the timing and amount of dividend payments will depend on our earnings  financial condition  cash requirements and availability  fleet renewal and expansion  restrictions in our loan agreements  the provisions of marshall islands law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders and other factors 
our board of directors may review and amend our dividend policy from time to time in light of our plans for future growth and other factors 
we believe that  under current law  our dividend payments from earnings and profits will constitute qualified dividend income and  as such  will generally be subject to a us federal income tax rate with respect to non corporate us shareholders that meet certain holding period and other requirements through 
distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be treated first as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of a us shareholder s tax basis in its common stock on a dollar for dollar basis and  thereafter  as capital gain 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to million from million 
the increase primarily was due to higher net income and depreciation and amortization in the year ended december  due to the operation of a larger fleet 
net cash from operating activities for year ended december  was primarily a result of recorded net income of million  and depreciation and amortization charges of million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided from operating activities was primarily a result of recorded net income of million  and depreciation and amortization charges of million  and amortization of deferred financing costs of million in the majority of our fleet was acquired in and as a result net cash used in investing activities declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the cash used in investing activities related primarily to the purchase of three additional vessels for million 
for the year ended december   the cash used in investing activities relating to the acquisition of ten vessels was million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash used by financing activities consisted mostly of the payment of cash dividends of million offset by million of proceeds from our new credit facility used to acquire three vessels 
for the year ended december   the primary sources of net cash provided by financing activities were net proceeds from our initial public equity offering of million and million in net borrowings under our new credit facility 
in addition  we retired the million outstanding under our original credit facility and paid cash dividends of million 
new credit facility subsequent to our initial public offering  we entered into a new credit facility as of july  the new credit facility is with a syndicate of commercial lenders including nordea bank finland plc  new york branch  dnb nor bank asa  new york branch and citibank  na the new credit facility has been used to refinance our indebtedness under our original credit facility  and may be used in the future to acquire additional vessels and for working capital requirements 
under the terms of our new credit facility  borrowings in the amount of million were used to repay indebtedness under our original credit facility and additional net borrowings of million were obtained to fund the acquisition of the genco muse 
in july  we increased the line of credit by million and during the second and third quarters borrowed million for acquisition of three vessels 
at december   million remains available to fund future vessel acquisitions 
we may borrow up to million of the million for working capital purposes 
additionally  on february   we reached an agreement with our lenders to allow us to increase the amount of the new credit facility by million  for a total maximum availability of million 
we have the option to increase the facility amount by million increments up to the additional million so long as at least one bank within the syndicate agrees to fund such increase 
any increase associated with this agreement is generally governed by the existing terms of the new credit facility  although we and any banks providing the increase may agree to vary the upfront fees  unutilized commitment fees  or other fees payable by us in connection with the increase 
the new credit facility has a term of ten years and matures on july  the facility permits borrowings up to of the value of the vessels that secure our obligations under the new credit facility up to the facility limit  provided that conditions to drawdown are satisfied 
the facility limit is million for a period of six years beginning july  thereafter  the facility limit is reduced by an amount equal to of the total million commitment  semi annually over a period of four years and is reduced to on the tenth anniversary 
our obligations under the new credit facility are secured by a first priority mortgage on each of the vessels in our fleet  as well as any future vessel acquisitions pledged as collateral and funded by the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is also secured by a first priority security interest in our earnings and insurance proceeds related to the collateral vessels 
we may grant additional security interest in vessels acquired that are not mortgaged 
our ability to borrow amounts under the new credit facility is subject to customary documentation relating to the facility  including security documents  satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent and compliance with terms and conditions included in the loan documents 
before each drawdown  we are required  among other things  to provide to the lenders acceptable valuations of the vessels in our fleet confirming that the aggregate amount outstanding under the facility determined on a pro forma basis giving effect to the amount proposed to be drawn down will not exceed of the value of the vessels pledged as collateral 
to the extent the vessels in our fleet that secure our obligations under the new credit facility are insufficient to satisfy minimum security requirements at the time of a drawdown or any time thereafter  we will be required to grant additional security or obtain a waiver or consent from the lenders 
we will also not be permitted to borrow amounts under the facility  and will be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the facility  if we experience a change in control 
all of our vessel owning subsidiaries are full and unconditional joint and several guarantors of our new credit facility 
each of these subsidiaries is wholly owned by genco shipping trading limited 
genco shipping trading limited has no independent assets or operations 
interest on the amounts drawn is payable at the rate of per annum over libor until the fifth anniversary of the closing of the new credit facility and per annum over libor thereafter 
we are also obligated to pay a commitment fee equal to per annum on any undrawn amounts available under the facility 
on july   the we paid an arrangement fee to the lenders of million on the original commitment of million and an additional million for the million commitment increase which equates to of the total commitment of million as of july  these arrangement fees along with other costs have been capitalized as deferred financing costs 
in the year ended december   we incurred an expense of million to write off deferred financing fees associated with our original credit facility which was entirely repaid on july  under the terms of our new credit facility  we are permitted to pay or declare dividends in accordance with our dividend policy so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from such declaration or payment 
the new credit facility has certain financial covenants that require us  among other things  to ensure that the fair market value of the collateral vessels maintains a certain multiple as compared to the outstanding indebtedness  maintain a specified ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization  maintain a specified ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense  maintain a net worth of approximately million  and maintain working capital liquidity in an amount of not less than million per vessel securing the borrowings 
additionally there are certain non financial covenants that require us  among other things  to provide the lenders with certain legal documentation such as the mortgage on a newly acquired vessel using funds from the new credit facility  and other periodic communications with the lenders that include certain compliance certificates at the time of borrowing and on a quarterly basis 
for the period since facility inception through december   we were in compliance with these covenants  except for an age covenant in conjunction with the acquisition of the genco commander  a vessel  for which we obtained a waiver for the term of the agreement 
original credit facility on december   we entered into the original credit facility with a limit of million with a group of lender banks 
the loan had a five year maturity at a rate of libor plus per year until million had been repaid and thereafter at libor plus 
in the event of late principal payments  additional interest charges would have been incurred 
this facility was retired with proceeds from the initial public offering and proceeds from our new credit facility 
interest rate swap agreements and forward freight agreements effective september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with dnb nor bank to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
the notional principal amount of the swap is million and has a fixed interest rate on the notional amount of through july  the swap 
the swap s expiration date coincides with the scheduled expiration of the new credit facility on july  the differential to be paid or received for this swap agreement was recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
the change in value on this swap was reflected as a component of other comprehensive income oci 
we determined that this interest rate swap agreement  which initially hedged the corresponding debt  continues to perfectly hedge the debt 
interest income expense pertaining to the swap for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
on march   we  entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  and has a fixed interest rate on the notional amount of from january  through january  the swap 
the change in the value of this swap and the rate differential to be paid or received for this swap agreement was recognized as income from derivative instruments and was listed as a component of other expense until we incurred obligations against which the swap was designated and was an effective hedge 
in november  we designated million of the swap s notional amount against our debt and utilized hedge accounting whereby the change in value for the portion of the swap that was effectively hedged was recorded as a component of oci 
on march   we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and has a fixed interest rate on the notional amount of from january  through january  the swap 
the change in the value of this swap and the rate differential to be paid or received for this swap agreement was recognized as expense from derivative instruments and was listed as a component of other expense until we incurred obligations against which the swap was designated and was an effective hedge 
effective july  we designated million and in october designated the remaining million of the swap s notional amount against our debt and utilized hedge accounting whereby the change in value for the portion of the swap that was effectively hedged was recorded as a component of oci 
for the portion of our debt which has been hedged and the rate differential on the swap is in effect  the total interest rate is fixed at the fixed interest rate of swap plus the applicable margin on the debt of in the first five years of the new credit facility and in the last five years 
the swap and the swap do not have any interest income or expense as the swaps are not effective until january  and january   respectively 
the rate differential on the portion of the swap that has not been designated against our debt and any portion of the swap that is ineffectively hedged for these two instruments will be reflected as income from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense once effective 
the rate differential on any portion of the swaps that effectively hedges our debt will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
the asset associated with the swap at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  and is presented as the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet 
the liability associated with the swap and the swap at december  and december  is million  and is presented as the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet 
during  there were no swaps that were in a liability position 
as of december  and december   we had accumulated oci of million and million  respectively  related to the swap and a portion of the swap and swap that is effectively hedged 
the portions of the swap and the swap that has not been effectively hedged resulted in income from derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  due to the change in the value of these instruments when these instruments did not have designations associated with them 
the swap and the swap were not entered into at december  as part of our business strategy  we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements  or ffas  to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
these arrangements may include future contracts  or commitments to perform in the future a shipping service between ship owners  charters and traders 
generally  these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
although ffas can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  if we decided to enter into ffas  our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
it is not currently our intention to enter into ffas to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels 
if we determine to enter into ffas  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market 
we have not entered into any ffas as of december interest rates the effective interest rates  including the cost associated with the unused commitment fees and the rate differential on the swap  incurred during the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
the interest rates on the debt  excluding the unused commitment fees ranged from to during the year ended december  and ranged from to during the year ended december  contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and their maturity dates that is reflective of the outstanding debt  including the effective fixed rate on the interest rate swap agreements that have been designated against the respective effective rate differentials on the agreements 
the interest and fees are also reflective of the new credit facility and the interest rate swap agreements as discussed above under interest rate swap agreements and forward freight agreements 
total within one year one to three years three to five years more than five years us dollars in thousands bank loans interest and borrowing fees office lease interest expense has been estimated using the fixed rate of for the notional amount of the swap  for the notional amount of the swap  for the notional amount of the swap and for the portion of the debt that has no designated swap against it  plus the applicable bank margin of in the first five years of the new credit facility and in the last five years 
the debt repayment within one year is the result of the required repayment of the debt associated with the sale of the genco glory and as reflected on the december  balance sheet as current portion of long term debt 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions 
our fleet currently consists of seven panamax drybulk carriers  seven handymax drybulk carriers and five handysize drybulk carriers 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings 
we estimate our drydocking costs and scheduled off hire days for our fleet through to be estimated drydocking cost estimated offhire days us dollars in millions year the costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in china 
we estimate that each drydock will result in days of offhire 
actual costs will vary based on various factors  including where the drydockings are actually performed 
we expect to fund these costs with cash from operations 
the genco trader and the genco marine completed their drydocking during the first half of at a combined cost of million 
the genco marine exceeded the budget due to the vessel drydocking in portugal rather than china 
during third quarter  the genco muse completed drydocking at a cost of million  exceeding its initial budget due to the vessel drydocking in the united states due to positioning rather than in china 
during the fourth quarter  we completed the drydocking of the genco carrier and genco glory at a combined cost of million 
during june and at the delivery of the vessel  we incurred a deferred drydock cost of million associated with the genco trader 
we estimate that ten of our vessels will be drydocked during  of which two will be drydocked during the first quarter of  and an additional six of our vessels in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions 
in the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear  these pressures would increase our operating  voyage  general and administrative  and financing costs 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for an additional description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this k 
revenue and voyage expense recognition revenues are generated from time charters 
a time charter involves placing a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily or monthly hire rate 
in time charters  operating costs such as for crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel  and port charges are paid by the charterer 
there are certain other non specified voyage expenses such as commissions which are borne by us 
we record time charter revenues over the term of each charter as service is provided 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis as the average revenue over the term of each time charter 
we recognize vessel operating expenses when incurred 
in december and february  respectively  the genco trader and genco leader entered into the baumarine panamax pool 
vessel pools  such as the baumarine panamax pool  provide cost effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels 
the pool arrangement provides the benefits of a large scale operation and chartering efficiencies that might not be available to smaller fleets 
under the pool arrangement  the vessels operate under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer and operating costs including crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel 
since the members of the pool share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool  and the pool operates in the spot market  the revenue earned by these two vessels was subject to the fluctuations of the spot market 
in december and january  respectively  the genco trader and genco leader exited the baumarine panamax pool 
our standard time charter contracts with our customers specify certain performance parameters  which if not met can result in customer claims 
as of december   we had a reserve of million against due from charterers balance and an additional reserve of million both associated with estimated customer claims against us for time charter performance issues 
as of december   we had a reserve of million associated with estimated customer claims against us for time charter performance issues 
vessel acquisitions when we enter into an acquisition transaction  we determine whether the acquisition transaction was the purchase of an asset or a business based on the facts and circumstances of the transaction 
in the shipping industry  the purchase of a vessel is normally treated as a purchase of an asset as the historical operating data for the vessel is not reviewed nor is material to our decision to make such acquisition 
when a vessel is acquired with an existing time charter  we allocate the purchase price of the vessel and the time charter based on  among other things  vessel market valuations and the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired charters of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the charter terms and ii management s estimate of the fair market charter rate  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the charter 
the capitalized above market assets and below market liabilities charters are amortized as a reduction or increase  respectively  to voyage revenues over the remaining term of the charter 
depreciation we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon per lightweight ton 
an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use 
impairment of long lived assets we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the asset s carrying amount 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future charter rates  scrap values  future drydock costs and vessel operating costs are included in this analysis 
deferred drydocking costs our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we capitalize the costs associated with drydockings as they occur and depreciate these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings 
capitalized drydocking costs include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard  and cost of parts that are believed to be reasonably likely to reduce the duration or cost of the drydocking  cost of travel  lodging and subsistence of our personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise  and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee a drydocking 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with us gaap guidelines and industry practice and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates  we use interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate differentials to be paid or received under these agreements for any portion of designated debt that is effectively hedged is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense 
the interest rate differential on the swaps that do not have designated debt or is not effectively hedged will be reflected as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are recognized in the financial statements as non current asset or liability 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of hedged interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period of interest rate exposure provided the designated liability continues to exist 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of unhedged interest rate swaps are reflected as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense 
income taxes pursuant to section of the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code  qualified income derived from the international operations of ships is excluded from gross income and exempt from us federal income tax if a company engaged in the international operation of ships meets certain requirements 
among other things  in order to qualify  the company must be incorporated in a country which grants an equivalent exemption to us corporations and must satisfy certain qualified ownership requirements 
we are incorporated in the marshall islands 
pursuant to the income tax laws of the marshall islands  we are not subject to marshall islands income tax 
the marshall islands has been officially recognized by the internal revenue service as a qualified foreign country that currently grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax 
based on the ownership of our common stock prior to our initial public offering on july   we qualified for exemption from income tax for under section  since we were a controlled foreign corporation cfc and satisfied certain other criteria in the section regulations 
we were a cfc  as defined in the code  since until the initial public offering on july   over of our stock was owned by united states holders each of whom owned ten percent or more of our voting stock  or us owners 
during that time  approximately of our common stock was held by us owners 
based on the publicly traded requirement of the section regulations as described in the next paragraph  we believe that the we qualified for exemption from income tax for immediately following the initial public offering  the us owners beneficially owned less than of our stock 
they continued to own less than of our stock and there were no additional us owners during  and accordingly  we were no longer eligible to qualify for exemption from tax under section based on being a cfc 
instead  we can only qualify for exemption if we satisfy the publicly traded requirement of the section regulations 
in order to meet the publicly traded requirement for and future years  our stock must be treated as being primarily and regularly traded for more than half the days of any such year 
under the section regulations  our qualification for the publicly traded requirement may be jeopardized if shareholders of our common stock that own five percent or more of our stock shareholders own  in the aggregate  or more of our common stock for more than half the days of the year 
we believe that  during  the combined ownership of our shareholders did not equal or more of our common stock for more than half the days of however  if our shareholders were to increase their ownership to or more of our common stock for more than half the days of or any future taxable year  we would not be eligible to claim exemption from tax under section for that taxable year 
we can therefore give no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for exemption from tax in or in future years 
if we do not qualify for the exemption from tax under section  we would be subject to a tax on our gross shipping income without the allowance for any deductions that is treated as derived from sources within the united states or united states source shipping income 
for these purposes  shipping income means any income that is derived from the use of vessels  from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use  or from the performance of services directly related to those uses  and united states source shipping income includes of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends  but that does not both begin and end  in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings and cash flow in relation to its borrowings 
we held three interest rate risk management instruments at december  and one at december   in order to manage future interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
effective september   we entered into the swap  on march   the swap and on march   the swap 
these swaps manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
for the portion of our debt which has been hedged and the rate differential on the swap that is in effect  the total interest rate is fixed at the fixed interest rate of swap plus the applicable margin on the debt of in the first five years of the new credit facility and in the last five years 
the asset associated with the swap at december  and december  is million and million  respectively  and is presented as the fair value of the derivative on the balance sheet 
the liability associated with the swap and swap at december  and december  is million  and is presented as the fair value of the derivatives on the balance sheet 
during  there were no swaps that were in a liability position 
as of december  and december   we have accumulated oci of million and million  respectively  related to the swap and a portion of the swap and the swap that was effectively hedged 
the portions of the swap and the swap that has not been effectively hedged resulted in income from derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  due to the change in the value of these instruments when these instruments did not have designations associated with them 
the swap and the swap were not entered into at december  derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates  we use interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate differentials to be paid or received under these agreements for any portion of designated debt that is effectively hedged is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense 
the interest rate differential on the swaps that do not have designated debt or are not effectively hedged will be reflected as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other income or expense 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are recognized in the financial statements as non current asset or liability 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of hedged interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period of interest rate exposure provided the designated liability continues to exist 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of unhedged interest rate swaps are reflected as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense 
the expiration date of the swap coincides with the expiration of the new credit facility on july  the differential to be paid or received for the swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
the change in value on this swap is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income oci 
the change in the value for the swap and the swap as well as the rate differential to be paid or received for these swap agreements was recognized as income from derivative instruments and was listed as a component of other expense until we had obligations against which the swap was designated and was an effective hedge 
additionally the change in value of the swap and the swap that was not an effective hedge against our debt was reflected as a component of other expense 
for the swap and the swap  the change in value for the portion that had been designated against our debt and remained effectively hedged was recorded as a component of oci and the rate differential  once effective  on the swap and the swap will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
effective july  we designated million and in october designated the remaining million of the swap s notional amount against our debt and utilized hedge 
for the portion of our debt which has been hedged and the rate differential on the swap that is in effect  the total interest rate is fixed at the fixed interest rate of swap plus the applicable margin on the debt of in the first five years of the new credit facility and in the last five years 
for the swap  we qualified for hedge accounting treatment and we have determined that this interest rate swap agreement continues to perfectly hedge the debt 
interest income expense pertaining to the swap for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   the swap and the swap do not have any interest income or expense as the swaps are not effective until january  and january   respectively 
the fair value of the swap was in an asset position at december  and december  of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the swap and swap was in a liability position at december  and december  of million 
during  there were no swaps that were in a liability position 
we are subject to market risks relating to changes in interest rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding 
we paid interest on this debt based on libor plus an average spread of on our original credit facility  and paid libor plus for the debt in excess of the swap notional amount on the new credit facility  and on the million of our debt that corresponds to the notional amount of the swap  an effective rate of plus a margin of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we paid libor plus for the debt in excess of the swap notional amount on the new credit facility  and on the million of our debt that corresponds to the notional amount of the swap  an effective rate of plus a margin of 
a increase in libor would result in an increase of million in interest expense for the year ended december  considering the increase would be only on the unhedged portion of the debt for which the rate differential on the respective swap is not in effect 
foreign exchange rate risk the international shipping industry s functional currency is the us dollar 
virtually all of our revenues and most of our operating costs are in us dollars 
we incur certain operating expense in currencies other than the us dollar  and the foreign exchange risk associated with these operating expenses is immaterial
