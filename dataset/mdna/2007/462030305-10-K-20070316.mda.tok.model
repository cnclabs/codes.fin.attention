item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design and market products and provide services that help our customers store and protect their valuable digital information 
our six reportable segments are based primarily on the nature of our products and include consumer storage solutions css products  zip products  rev products  network storage systems nss products  services and other products 
the css products segment involves the worldwide distribution and sale of various storage devices including external hard disk drives hdd  cd rw drives  dvd rewritable drives  micro mini usb flash drives and external floppy disk drives 
the zip products segment involves the distribution and sale of zip drives and disks to retailers  distributors  resellers and oems 
we have ceased selling zip drives to distributors or resellers in the european union eu as of july   in the wake of the restriction of hazardous substances rohs lead free initiative 
notwithstanding rohs  our distributors and resellers are permitted and have continued to sell zip drives from their inventories 
sales of zip disks are continuing worldwide  including the eu 
the rev products segment involves the development  distribution and sale of rev products to retailers  distributors  oems and resellers throughout the world 
the nss products segment consists primarily of the development  distribution and sale of network attached storage servers and network hdd drives previously included in the css products segment in the entry level and low end network attached storage market 
the services segment consists of the operations of csci  inc csci  including officescreen solutions  systems integration and iomega services such as istorage tm previously included in the other products segment 
we acquired csci in august of csci s officescreen managed security services include managing firewalls  virtual private networks vpns and providing remote access for small businesses 
the other products segment consists of license and patent fee income not assigned to specific products and products that have been discontinued or are otherwise immaterial  including jaz disks and software products such as iomega automatic backup software and other miscellaneous products 
since  the zip products segment has been the largest contributor to our product operating income 
as the zip business has approached the end of its product lifecycle  we have been trying to find other profitable sources of revenue to replace the declining high gross margin zip revenue 
in recent years  we have invested significant efforts and dollars on the development of the first and second generation rev products  which were launched in the second quarter of and july of  respectively 
sales of rev products have exceeded zip product sales for the past three quarters  however  rev products are not yet profitable  however  the rev products operating losses have declined for the past several quarters as a result of the cost reduction actions that we have taken in and in other efforts to replace the declining zip business  we have launched and attempted to expand our css and nss businesses 
sales of the css business segment significantly exceeds zip product sales 
our css business segment achieved operating profitability of million in the fourth quarter of this was the first profitable quarter for css ever 
the nss segment has been only slightly profitable for the past several quarters 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued as part of an ongoing effort to return to profitability  we announced a restructuring plan on april   which was implemented in the second and third quarters of the restructuring plan was part of an effort to reduce costs and simplify our organizational structure 
we anticipate million to million in annual savings from these restructuring actions compared to the first quarter run rates 
in addition  in  we released new hdd products and made changes to our hdd product supply chain to reduce the cost of these products to allow us to be more competitive in the market place 
although we still lost money on our css segment for the full year ended  we experienced significant improvements to our css product operating losses  which decreased significantly due to the new products  supply chain changes and other cost reductions and made a profit in the fourth quarter 
during the first quarter of  we established certain business goals to complete development of and launch the higher capacity  next generation rev products  improve hdd product gross margins through sourcing changes  new products and other cost reductions  focus on growing our rev product sales through system integrator programs to generate awareness  server oem transactions and adoption in targeted vertical markets such as the professional audio video market and evaluate other strategic opportunities in the small business market segment to facilitate long term growth 
during  we made significant steady progress toward these goals with the cost reductions associated with the april restructuring actions  the launch of our new rev backup drive in july  the launch of newly designed lower cost external hdd products in august and the acquisition of csci  inc  a provider of managed services to small businesses  in august 
at december   our total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and temporary investments were million see the liquidity and capital resources discussion for more detail on the tax impacts of repatriating foreign cash 
we believe our total cash is sufficient to operate the business for at least one year 
our goals for are to continue to grow and deliver sustained profitability  to further increase the size of our hdd business  to continue to penetrate the high growth nas market  to ramp rev gb products and push for broad market adoption  to grow our managed services business domestically and abroad and to continue to evaluate new opportunities where we can leverage our brand and channel assets 
notwithstanding our recent accomplishments  there can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments occur include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  price protection and rebate reserves  inventory valuation reserves  accrued excess purchase commitments  tax valuation allowances and tax contingencies  and impairment of goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition we defer recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and direct marketing reseller dmr formerly referred to as catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds our channel s four week requirement as estimated by us 
original equipment manufacturers oems and value added resellers vars customers are not considered to have excess inventory  as they usually do not carry more than four weeks of inventory 
we estimate the distribution  retail and dmr channel s four week requirement based on inventory and sell through amounts reported to us by our key customers in each channel  who make up the substantial majority of our sales in these channels 
no adjustment is made for those customers that do not report inventory and sell through information 
this inventory and sell through information is reported to us at the stock keeping unit sku level 
however  for purposes of our excess inventory calculation  this information is accumulated at the major product level ie zip mb drive  zip mb drive  etc we use the last weeks of reported sell through information to calculate a weekly average  which is then used to estimate the channel s four week requirement 
this estimate may not be indicative of four weeks of future sell through 
we defer sales and cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory in our consolidated statements of operations  with the resulting offset being reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in margin on deferred revenue 
the table below shows the deferred sales and related cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory 
december  in thousands deferred revenue deferred cost of sales margin on estimated channel inventory the decrease in margin on estimated channel inventory during reflects lower levels of channel inventory and product mix changes away from high margin zip products to lower margin products 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to excess channel inventory are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the variability of the different inputs to the calculation of the reserve such as changes in the level of channel inventory and channel sell through rates and the material impact that changes in these inputs can have on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue 
excess channel inventory is a critical estimate for all segments of our business 
since we have no material debt and adequate cash balances  we believe that changes in excess channel inventory accruals would not impact our liquidity 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued price protection and rebate reserves we have agreements with some of our direct and indirect customers which  in the event of a price decrease  allow those customers subject to certain limitations a credit equal to the difference between the price originally paid and the new decreased price on units in the customer s inventory on the date of the price decrease not to exceed the number of units shipped to the customer for a specified time period prior to the price decrease 
when a price decrease is anticipated  we establish reserves against gross trade receivables with the corresponding reduction in sales for estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers 
in addition  we record reserves at the time of shipment for estimated volume rebates and other estimated rebates given to consumers at the time of purchase from channel partners for which sales have been recognized 
estimates for rebates are based on a number of variable factors that depend on the specific program or product 
these variables include the anticipated redemption rate of rebates  anticipated sales volumes in the channel  the perceived consumer value of the rebate and historical experience 
changes in any of these variables would have a direct impact on the amount of the recorded reserves 
we use price protection and rebate programs in all of our segments and record the charges in our consolidated statement of operations against their respective segment 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to price protection and rebate programs are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the assumptions made concerning redemption rates and other variables and changes in this reserve can have a material impact on sales and trade receivables 
price protection and rebate reserves have fluctuated in the past 
for example  during  million of price protection and rebate reserves that were recorded in prior periods were released  as they were not claimed as originally estimated 
reserves for volume and other rebates and price protection totaled million at december  and million at december  and are netted against trade receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in this reserve for was primarily a reflection of lower rebate and price protection programs during relative to the lower sales in we believe that the use of rebates will continue to be a significant part of our business strategy 
since we have no material debt and adequate cash balances  we believe that changes in price protection and rebate accruals would not impact our liquidity 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued inventory valuation reserves we evaluate the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices including known future price decreases 
we include product costs and direct selling expenses in our analysis of inventory realization 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed such costs and expenses  valuation reserves are established against inventories 
in addition  we generally consider inventory that is not expected to be sold within established timelines  as forecasted by our material requirements planning system  as excess and thus appropriate inventory reserves are established through a charge to cost of sales 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to inventory valuation reserves are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products and future sales prices  the competitive nature of the technology industry which can quickly change the price of our products in the market place or the overall demand for our products and changes in the value of inventory can have a material impact on cost of sales and inventory valuation reserves 
inventory valuation reserve adjustments are necessitated primarily from changes in estimating future sales volumes and from changes in the estimates made of future sales prices 
estimating future sales volumes is particularly difficult for new products and end of life eol products 
estimating future sales price is particularly difficult on css products due to price competition and short product cycles 
zip products have shown a long market life compared to our other products 
in light of their high margins  its inventory carrying value has been recoverable at estimated selling prices 
consequently  zip products have not  until recently  been as susceptible to inventory valuation reserve adjustments as some of our other products 
now  as zip products reach the end of their product life cycle  zip products and components have become susceptible to excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
if zip volumes decline at a quicker rate or in greater volumes than forecasted  the risk associated with inventory valuation reserves will increase 
during  we recorded a net decrease in inventory valuation reserves of million 
the million decrease was comprised of net additions of million less utilization of million as reserved products were scrapped or sold 
the million of net additions to inventory valuation reserves were comprised of million of net additions for css products  partially offset by million of net releases for zip products and million of net releases for rev products 
the million of css products charges related primarily to write downs of hdd inventory to market costs  partially offset by hdd products that we determined could be re worked and sold that had previously been considered excess 
the million inventory reserve utilizations were comprised of million for zip products and million for css products primarily hdd as products were sold or scrapped 
the zip products utilization related primarily to zip product components scrapped in the first quarter of during  we recorded a net decrease in inventory valuation reserves of million 
the million decrease was comprised of additions of million less utilization of million as reserved product was scrapped or sold 
the million of additions to inventory valuation reserves were comprised of million for css products  million for zip products  million for rev products  million for nss products  with the remaining million for other various products 
the million of css products charges related primarily to write downs of inventory to market costs and excess inventory on certain hdd products that were not selling as originally expected 
the million inventory reserve utilizations were 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued comprised of million for zip products  million for css products  million for nss products and million for other various products as products were sold or scrapped 
the zip products utilization related primarily to zip product assemblies scrapped in the second quarter of at december   we had inventory valuation reserves of million  which compares to inventory valuation reserves of million at december  the decrease of million in inventory valuation reserves during was primarily attributable to utilizations of reserves as described above 
adjustments to inventory reserves are non cash adjustments and would not affect our liquidity 
accrued excess purchase commitments the purchase orders under which we buy many of our products generally extend one to three quarters in the future 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on forecasted future sales requirements 
it is difficult to estimate future product demand for new products or products with declining sales 
such estimates may result in excess purchase commitments  where we make commitments for purchases that we do not ultimately utilize 
the accrual for excess purchase commitments also includes liabilities such as cancellation charges or handling fees incurred because of excess supplier inventory or equipment 
with the continuing decline of zip volumes  this has become an area of particular risk for us 
suppliers of certain critical components of both zip drives and disks have stopped producing  or eol d  such components and other suppliers are planning to do so 
in such cases  we attempt to make an eol purchase of the required component s based on our estimates of all future requirements 
with respect to estimating excess purchase commitments  we are at risk that we will order insufficient or excess quantities of key components or that certain suppliers may produce excess inventory of key components in the absence of firm orders from us  leading to potential disputes regarding payment obligations 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to accrued excess purchase commitments are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products  the inherit difficulty of estimating future requirements or final build out of components that have been eol d by the supplier and decisions to discontinue projects with suppliers 
during  we recorded a net increase in excess purchase commitment reserves of million 
this increase was comprised of million of additions less utilizations of million 
the additions of million resulted from million for rev products and million for css products 
the million of utilizations resulted primarily from million for zip products  million for css products and million for rev products 
during  we recorded a net increase in excess purchase commitment reserves of million 
this increase was comprised of million of additions less utilizations of million 
the additions of million resulted from million for css products primarily hdd products  million for zip products and million for rev products 
the million of utilizations resulted primarily from million for zip products  million for css products  million for rev products  and the remaining million for other various products 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued since we have no material debt and adequate cash balances  we believe that changes in accrued excess purchase commitments would not impact our liquidity 
tax valuation allowances and tax contingencies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
during this evaluation  we review our forecasts of income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease our tax provision or benefit 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provision benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
for example  during  we recorded a million decrease in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from decreases in deferred tax assets and partially offset by decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
included in the million decrease in the valuation allowance was a million decreased valuation allowance resulting from decreases in the nol and credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets related to inventory and accrued expenses 
we also released million of foreign tax contingencies 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally during  we recorded an million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
adjustments to deferred tax valuation allowances are non cash adjustments and do not affect our cash flows 
impairment of goodwill we have million of goodwill  of which million is associated with the zip products segment 
the remaining goodwill is associated with the csci  inc acquisition 
we expect to experience additional non cash  zip goodwill impairment charges as zip sales and profits continue to decline 
we will be required to take these charges in and we expect that the charges most likely will be recorded in the first half of we perform our annual impairment test required under sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets sfas in the first quarter of each year 
this test compares our zip specific assets to the estimated future  discounted cash flows to determine if these cash flows will cover the assets 
additionally  each quarter  we compare how actual quarterly zip profits are tracking with the projected zip profits cash flows that were used in the annual impairment test to make sure that there has not been a significant adverse change in business climate or that an unforeseen trend has developed 
as part of this quarterly review  we also look for any other indicators of impairment  such as any significant adverse changes in legal factors  adverse regulatory assessments or loss of key personnel 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued we believe that the accounting estimates related to assessing potential impairment of our goodwill are critical accounting estimates because the subjectivity inherent in determining the fair value of the zip products segment and the impact that future impairment charges will have on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets 
future goodwill impairment charges will be non cash charges and will not affect our cash flows

in  we undertook an analysis and objective evaluation of the market environment in which the dct technology would compete and decided not to proceed with the dct development rather  we would seek to license the technology 
as part of the wind down activities during the third quarter of  we determined that fixed assets related solely to the dct technology were impaired and thus during recorded  as cost of sales  million of impairment charges 
these million of charges were attributable entirely to the other products business segment 
the fair value of the assets was determined based on industry knowledge and from the disposition of similar assets in the past 
during  we also recorded million of other charges for cancelled commitments  comprised primarily of supplier claims  for equipment and parts that had been committed to by our suppliers as well as second tier suppliers 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a definitive license agreement regarding our dct intellectual property 
the license agreement terms included an upfront cash payment of million to us and an additional million cash payment to us at a later date based upon the licensee s commercialization date of the technology  but no later than november further  the license agreement calls for potential royalties to be paid on any future products utilizing the technology up to million  work on certain products has been suspended that would utilize the technology  so potential royalties from that transaction are unlikely 
the million was reflected as a benefit to operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations under the caption  license and patent fee income  as the cash had been received and we have fulfilled all of our obligations related to that payment

the north america activities consisted of outsourcing our distribution center in north carolina and terminating the related lease  closing several sales offices in the united states and consolidating operations at our north america facilities primarily roy  utah  all of which resulted in a workforce reduction of regular employees and temporary staff across all business functions and across all levels of the organization 
at september   of the individuals whose positions were identified for termination in the third quarter of  individuals were scheduled to continue to work on a transition basis through various identified dates ending no later than december  transition pay was not a part of the restructuring charges but rather was reported in normal operations as incurred

our css segment involves the worldwide distribution and sale of various storage devices including external hard disk drives hdd  cd rw drives  dvd rewritable drives  micro mini usb flash drives and external floppy disk drives 
during the second half of  we began to focus this segment primarily on hdd products 
the zip products segment involves the distribution and sale of zip drives and disks to retailers  distributors  resellers and oems 
we have ceased selling zip drives to distributors or resellers in the european union eu as of july   in the wake of the restriction of hazardous substances rohs lead free initiative

our rev products segment involves the development  distribution and sale of rev products to retailers  distributors  oems and resellers throughout the world 
the first generation rev drives  which began shipping in april of  are removable hard disk storage systems with a native capacity of gigabytes gb where gigabyte equals billion bytes and up to gb of compressed capacity

our nss segment consists primarily of the development  distribution and sale of network attached storage servers and the network hdd drives which were previously reported under the css segment in the consumer products category in the entry level and low end network attached storage market 
our services segment consists of the operations of csci  including officescreen solutions and system integration  and iomega services such as istorage

effective january   we began to evaluate such performance based on product operating income 
product operating income is defined as sales and other income related to a segment s operations  less both fixed and variable product costs  and direct and allocated operating expenses 
operating expenses are charged to the product segments on a direct method or as a percentage of sales 
when such costs and expenses exceed sales and other income  this is referred to as a product operating loss 
the accounting policies of the product segments are the same as those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statments 
intersegment sales  eliminated in consolidation  are not material 
non allocated operating expenses include restructuring charges and certain extraordinary expenses 
the information in the following table was derived directly from our internal segments financial information used for corporate management purposes

although total css products sales increased only million from the previous year  our external hard drive business increased by million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily offset by a million decrease in optical sales  million in micro mini usb flash drive sales and million in floppy drive sales 
the lower optical and micro mini usb sales are a result of our decision in mid to eliminate unprofitable skus in the optical and micro mini usb flash product lines 
zip product sales continued to decline in  both in terms of units and sales dollars 
sales of zip products represented of total sales for  compared to of total sales for we expect zip drive and disk sales to continue to decrease as zip products approach the end of their product life cycle

gross margin our gross margin details for the years ended december  and are shown in the table below 
years ended december  change change in thousands  except total gross margin dollars total gross margin total gross margin dollars in decreased primarily from a lower proportion of higher margin zip product sales and from lower overall sales 
the lower gross margin percentage was primarily due to a lower proportion of zip product sales  partially offset by higher css product gross margins 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued the zip product gross margin percentage increased in primarily from the and restructuring actions and the fact that the gross margin contained higher eol charges 
total zip product gross margin dollars decreased due to significantly lower zip product sales 
future zip product gross margin percentage could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as zip product sales continue to decline and depending on potential eol or other charges 
css product gross margins increased in terms of both dollars and percentages during the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily due to the introduction of new cost competitive hdd products  lower material and overhead costs of the hdd products  lower optical  micro mini usb flash and floppy sales and pricing and other programs related to hdd drives and higher overall css sales 
all css products faced competitive pricing pressures during the year ended december  and we anticipate continued competitive pricing pressures on these products in the future 
rev product gross margins decreased in terms of both dollars and percentages during  due to lower volumes and the manufacturing start up costs associated with the launch of the rev gb products 
future gross margin percentages will depend on a wide variety of factors  including those discussed in the section entitled  risk factors in item a of part i in this form k filing 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to improve or maintain gross margins in any subsequent quarter or year

included in the million decrease in the valuation allowance was a million decreased valuation allowance resulting from decreases in the nol and credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets related to inventory and accrued expenses

for  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million  on a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million 
the net income tax benefit was comprised of a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from decreases in deferred tax liabilities and partially offset by the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss and million of tax benefits primarily from the release of tax accruals 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was a million increased valuation allowance resulting from decreases in deferred tax liabilities because of a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance as the result of decreases in the deferred tax asset of million related to fixed assets  trade receivables  inventory and accrued expenses 
the realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when we determine that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have recorded tax contingencies related to items in various countries  which are included in other accrued liabilities and in deferred income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets

we recorded tax contingencies of million in to the benefit provision for income taxes to accrue interest on foreign contingencies 
we reversed tax contingencies of million in to the benefit provision for income taxes  due to the completion of a tax authority exam without adjustment 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured by applying the enacted tax rates and laws in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse

product operating income is defined as sales and other income related to a segment s operations  less both fixed and variable product costs  and direct and allocated operating expenses 
operating expenses are charged to the product segments on a direct basis or as a percentage of sales

see the discussion above entitled  dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales for more detail regarding the license agreement 
licensing is not a part of our major or central operations and thus the dct transaction was considered a gain rather than revenue 
since the license fees recaptured costs that resulted directly from our research and development activities  the license fees were considered to be a part of operations and thus were shown as a separate line item of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
bad debt bad debt credits were consistent in when compared to at december   we had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  the increase is primarily a result of deductions taken by customers for programs  returns and other reasons  which we are in the process of reconciling and matching off against approved credits

included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was an million increased valuation allowance resulting from new foreign tax credits created by deemed swiss withholding taxes on foreign earnings 
the recording of the new foreign tax credits was the result of a change in our intention to repatriate foreign cash to the us in the form of dividends in the future

this cash was used to fund operations  acquire csci and make payments on an intercompany loan 
the repatriation of any of the million of foreign cash to the us will be taxable income in the us for federal and state tax purposes at a rate of approximately and also require a swiss withholding tax 
the amount of cash required for us federal and state taxes will be significantly less than our effective tax rate due to the availability of existing state nols  tax credit carry forwards  and previously taxed income 
the increase in working capital resulted primarily from lower accrued liabilities and higher inventory  partially offset by lower cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and lower deferred taxes 
the primary uses of cash from operations in were increases in inventories  operating losses  million for restructuring disbursements and changes in other current assets and liabilities as described below 
we also used million for the cash portion of the csci acquisition 
trade receivables increased in primarily from the timing of sales 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables remained relatively stable with only a slight decrease from days at december  to days at december  dso is calculated by multiplying the period end trade receivables balance by and dividing that amount by the sales for the quarter ended of the applicable year 
current deferred income taxes decreased primarily due to lower inventory and other accrued expense reserves 
inventories increased during primarily due to hdd products in transit at year end to satisfy existing backlog in early january 
other current liabilities decreased primarily as a result of the cumulative effect of adjustments from the adoption of sab no 
 which reduced tax contingency reserves by million 
additional paid in capital decreased in as compared to primarily due to the issuance of treasury shares related to the acquisition of csci 
it is our goal to achieve full year profitability and positive cash flow from operations through containing operating expense spending  hdd sales growth and maintaining or improving the gross margins of hdd products  growing rev product sales  ramping officescreen services sales  and managing the zip products business for cash flow

we believe that our balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flows from future operations  will be sufficient to fund anticipated working capital requirements  funding of restructuring actions  capital expenditures and cash required for other activities for at least one year 
we do not believe that our cash balances would be adequate to fund a material acquisition 
in that situation  we would need to borrow cash or fund the acquisition through a stock offering 
however  cash flow from future operations  investing activities  and the precise amount and timing of our future financing needs cannot be determined 
future cash flow will depend on a number of factors  including those set forth in the section labeled risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
should we be unable to meet our cash needs from our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and future cash flows from operations  we would most likely incur additional restructuring charges to adjust our expenditures to a level that our cash flows could support and or seek financing from other sources 
our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments is our sole source of liquidity 
given our history of sales declines and losses  there is no assurance that  if needed  we would be able to obtain financing from external sources or obtain a competitive interest rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various interest rate risks including foreign currency  interest rate and securities price risks 
we are exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from our functional currency 
we attempt to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
we use forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when re measured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  impact our consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  we are using only forward contract instruments to hedge our net balance sheet exposures 
the contracts are in european currencies 
we enter into contracts throughout the month as necessary 
these contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed days 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period that the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued the fair value of our forward contracts is subject to change because of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against these foreign currencies by  the hypothetical value of the contracts would have increased or decreased by approximately million at december  and million at december  however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges and consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and our ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedges 
we did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  and december  should we need to borrow funds in the future  we would be subject to credit based interest rate risks 
we are also subject to interest rate risks on our current cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances 
for example  if the interest rate on our interest bearing investments were to change basis points  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during and million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or our response to such hypothetical conditions 
investments purchased with maturities in excess of three months are classified as temporary investments 
none of our temporary investments have an effective maturity greater than months and at december  and  the average duration of our temporary investments was less than months 
at december   we had debt security investments of million that will mature within one year and million that will mature in more than one year but less than two years 
we seek to minimize our credit risk associated with temporary investments by purchasing investment grade  liquid securities 
we have classified all of our temporary investments as available for sale securities
