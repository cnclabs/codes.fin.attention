all forward looking statements included in this annual report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statements that may be made by or on behalf of us  in this annual report or otherwise 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
our business depends upon the growth of the student population and school expenditures and can be adversely impacted by fixed school budgets 
our growth strategy and profitability depend in part on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in prek schools 
the level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics  while expenditures per student are affected by federal  state and local government budgets 
for example  from to  the industry was negatively affected by a generally weakened economic environment which placed pressure on some state and local budgets  the primary sources of school funding 
this was evidenced  among other things  by the decline in state tax revenue in in school districts in states that primarily rely on local tax proceeds for funding  significant reductions in those proceeds for any reason can restrict district expenditures and impact our results of operations 
any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
because school budgets are fixed on a yearly basis  any shift by schools in expenditures during a given fiscal year to areas that are not part of our business could also materially affect our business 
for example  as was the case in fiscal  our results were adversely affected and our organic revenues throughout our business declined in part because we believe schools unexpectedly increased their expenditures on fuel and health related costs  and consequently decreased their spending on supplemental educational products and equipment 
if we are unable to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in recent years  a significant amount of our growth has come from acquisitions 
future growth in our revenues and earnings will be impacted by our ability to continue to acquire and successfully integrate businesses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire businesses on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth may be limited  or our revenues could decline 
in addition  the integration of acquired businesses with our existing business operations presents many challenges and can demand significant attention from our key managers 
the demands placed upon the time of our management team may adversely affect the operation of our existing business 
managing and integrating acquired businesses may result in substantial costs  delays  or other operating or financial problems that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
key risks involve failure to execute as well or as quickly as anticipated on our integration plans  including the integration of acquired employees  operations  technologies and products with our existing business and products  retention of business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business  loss of key personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of our management during the integration process  and resistance to cultural changes in the acquired organization 
increased costs associated with the distribution of our products would adversely affect our results of operations 
higher than expected costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products could affect our results of operations 
to the extent we incur difficulties or higher than expected costs related to updating our distribution centers  such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption in our ability to service our customers may also impact our revenues or profits 
moreover  as we update our distribution model or change the product mix of our distribution centers  we may encounter unforeseen costs or difficulties that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
our business is highly seasonal 
because most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year  we record most of our revenues from june to october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of orders for our products so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
to the extent we do not sell our products to schools during the peak shipping season  many of such sales opportunities will be lost and will not be available in subsequent quarters 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and significantly impacts our liquidity position 
if our key suppliers or service providers were unable to provide the products and services we require  our business could be adversely affected 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products  especially furniture and proprietary products 
we also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products 
if these suppliers or service providers are unable to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs especially during our peak season of june through october  our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our agreements with our suppliers are terminable at any time or on short notice  with or without cause  and  while we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be good  we cannot assure that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect 
our business is highly competitive 
the market for supplemental educational products and equipment is highly competitive and fragmented 
we estimate that over  companies market supplemental educational products and equipment to schools with prek as a primary focus of their business 
we also face competition from alternate channel marketers  including office supply superstores  office product contract stationers  and purchasing cooperatives that have not traditionally focused on marketing supplemental educational products and equipment 
our competitors impact the prices we are able to charge and we expect to continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors in the future 
these competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in supplemental educational products and equipment 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do 
we believe that the supplemental educational products and equipment market will consolidate over the next several years  which could increase competition in both our markets and our search for attractive acquisition candidates 
we also face increased competition and pricing pressure as a result of the accessibility of the internet 
if any of our key personnel discontinue their role with us  our business could be adversely affected 
our business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of current executive officers and senior management 
we are also likely to depend heavily on the executive officers and senior management of businesses that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people become unable or unwilling to continue in his or her role  or if we are unable to attract and retain other qualified employees  including a new chief financial officer and other key personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
although we have employment contracts with many of our executive officers  we generally do not have employment agreements with other members of our management 
other than the life insurance we have in place for our chief executive officer  we do not have and do not intend to obtain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of our management 
a failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our operations and growth opportunities 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and we may not be successful in implementing our strategy 
in addition  the implementation of our strategy may not lead to improved operating results 
we may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies due to business or competitive factors or factors not currently expected  such as unforeseen costs and expenses or events beyond our control 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth opportunities 
we face risks associated with our increasing emphasis on imported goods and private label products 
increases in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods may adversely impact our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
our business strategy includes an increased emphasis on offering private label products and sourcing quality merchandise directly from low cost suppliers 
as a result  we expect to rely more heavily on imported goods from china and other countries and we expect the sale of imported goods to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues 
to the extent we rely more heavily on the sale of private label products  our potential exposure to product liability claims may increase 
in addition  our reputation may become more closely tied to our private label products and may suffer to the extent our customers are not satisfied with the quality of such products 
private label products will also increase our risks associated with returns and inventory obsolescence 
our reliance on imported merchandise subjects us to a number of risks  including a increased difficulties in ensuring quality control  b disruptions in the flow of imported goods due to factors such as raw material shortages  work stoppages  strikes  and political unrest in foreign countries  c problems with oceanic shipping  including shipping container shortages  d economic crises and international disputes  e increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from a failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and the other countries we do business in  f import duties  import quotas  and other trade sanctions  and g increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans pacific shipping cartel 
if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable  we may not be able to transition to alternative sources in time to meet our demands 
a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods due to these or other factors would significantly decrease our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows 
currency exchange rates may impact our financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
to the extent we source merchandise from overseas manufacturers and sell products internationally  exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to service our us dollar denominated debt 
the majority of our debt will be in us dollars while a portion of our revenue is derived from imported products and international sales 
therefore  fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies versus the us dollar could impact our costs and revenues 
in addition  for the purposes of financial reporting  any change in the value of the foreign currencies against the us dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign currency loss or gain 
consequently  our reported earnings could fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange translation gains or losses and may not be comparable from period to period 
it is difficult to forecast our revenue stream given the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers 
the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  and the fact that our customers typically purchase products on an as needed basis  make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue stream  which may vary significantly from period to period 
financial analysts and others that may seek to project our future performance face similar difficulties 
the difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue increases the likelihood that our financial results will differ materially from any projected financial results 
any shortfall in our financial results from our or third party projected results could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and our convertible subordinated notes 
we have a material amount of goodwill  other intangible assets and capitalized product development costs which might be written down 
at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets we acquire 
in addition  we are required to evaluate whether our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
reductions in our net income caused by the write down of our existing goodwill or intangible assets or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in any future acquisition we may make could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  during fiscal and fiscal we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to goodwill and other intangibles assets of our discontinued school specialty media ssm business unit 
in addition  we have capitalized product development costs of million and million at april  and april   respectively  related to both internally developed and acquired proprietary products  which are amortized to expense over the lesser of five years or the product s life cycle 
any changes in the estimated sales volume or life cycle of the underlying products could cause the currently capitalized costs or costs capitalized in the future to be impaired 
for example  during fiscal and we recorded pre tax impairments charges of million and million  respectively  related to product development costs of ssm 
our operations are dependent on our information systems 
we have integrated the operations of most of our divisions and subsidiaries  which operate on a host system located at our greenville  wisconsin headquarters 
in addition  there are several divisions running legacy systems hosted at their locations 
all systems rely on continuous telecommunication connections to the main computers 
if any of these connections becomes disrupted  or unavailable  for an extended period of time  the disruption could materially and adversely affect our business  operations and financial performance 
we also continue to introduce new information systems to achieve a common processing infrastructure for all of our businesses  particularly the new erp platform described elsewhere in this report  which will displace existing legacy systems 
as we implement the new systems to the businesses  there is the possibility that it can be disruptive should the new systems not perform as expected 
even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from unexpected events that could interrupt new  existing and acquired business operations and systems  we cannot be sure that fire  flood or other natural disasters would not disable our systems and or prevent them from communicating between business segments 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also confront challenges in integrating the information systems of any companies we acquire 
the costs associated with performing such integrations or any disruptions resulting from a failure to successfully make any such integration could materially impact our business 
we rely on our intellectual property in the design and marketing of our products 
we rely on certain trademarks  trade names and service names  along with licenses to use and exploit certain trademarks  trade names and service names collectively  the marks in the design and marketing of some of our products 
we could lose our ability to use our brands if our marks were found to be generic or non descriptive 
while no single mark is material to our business  the termination of a number of these marks could have an adverse effect on our business 
we also rely on certain copyrights  patents and licenses other than those described above  the termination of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business  could prohibit us from engaging in transactions we believe to be beneficial and could lead to the acceleration of our debt 
our existing and future debt agreements impose and will impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities 
these restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  create liens  make acquisitions  redeem and or prepay certain debt  sell or dispose of a minority equity interest in any subsidiary or other assets  make capital expenditures  make certain investments  enter new lines of business  engage in consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  guarantee obligations  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and pay dividends and make other distributions 
our amended and restated senior credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a total leverage ratio  a senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers and acquisitions and other corporate opportunities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
background we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  services and ideas that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
we have grown in recent years through acquisitions and internal growth 
for information on our recent acquisitions see the business combinations note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our revenues for fiscal were billion  which represented a compound annual revenue growth  including acquisitions  of compared to our fiscal results 
our gross margin has improved from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was due to an increase in our offering of proprietary products and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have more proprietary products in their offerings and consequently higher gross margins than our essentials businesses 
the specialty businesses have also experienced higher revenue growth than the essentials businesses  resulting in a product mix with higher gross margins 
in addition  our growth has increased our purchasing power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
further  through the vertical acquisitions of school specialty publishing and califone  we have acquired suppliers and have thereby captured the suppliers margins 
another factor contributing to the increase in gross margin is the direct sourcing of product through overseas channels 
our historical operating profit and margins have been substantially impacted by the timing of our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses 
in fiscal  our operating profit and margin from continuing operations were million and  respectively 
in fiscal  our operating income and margin from continuing operations were million and  respectively 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our business is highly seasonal  and the acquisitions of seasonal businesses during the off season has depressed operating and net income in the year of acquisition  the most dramatic of which in recent years was the delta education acquisition in fiscal the company announced in fiscal its intention to sell the school specialty media ssm business unit 
the intended sale of the hawthorne  new york based ssm reflects the company s desire to focus investments and management s attention on those businesses that advance the company s long term growth strategies 
it also represents a first step in the company s effort to create a less complex organization that is more customer focused and more efficient 
the company has reflected ssm as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth certain information as a percentage of revenues on a historical basis concerning our results of operations for the fiscal years  and fiscal year revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses merger related expenses operating income 
interest expense  net other expense redemption costs and fees for convertible debt redemption income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes earnings from continuing operations consolidated historical results of continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion and analysis of fiscal results compared to fiscal results  is based on a comparison of the company s results of operations from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal revenues from continuing operations for fiscal increased to billion as compared to million in fiscal this increase was related primarily to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the august  acquisition of delta education llc delta 
the company s product mix continued to shift to the higher margin proprietary products  with the specialty segment comprising of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal this shift in product mix to higher margin specialty products expanded gross margins to from 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating margins increased from in fiscal before terminated merger costs to in fiscal the increase in the operating income and operating margin were related to the increased revenues and expansion in the gross margin due to the aforementioned product mix shift  as well as expense reductions due to cost control initiatives and non recurring expenses in fiscal revenue revenues increased from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal the growth in revenues was attributable primarily to the acquisition of delta 
specialty segment revenues increased from million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which included million of intersegment revenues 
the increase in specialty segment revenues was due primarily to the delta acquisition as fiscal included a full twelve months of activity from delta  in addition to organic growth in the specialty segment 
essentials segment revenues increased from million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues to million in fiscal which includes million of intersegment revenues 
the increase in essentials segment revenues was related to modest increases in both the consumable and furniture product offerings 
gross profit gross profit increased to million compared with million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in revenues and the shift in revenue mix to the higher margin specialty products 
the revenue mix shift to the higher margin specialty products was the main reason for the basis point improvement in gross margins from in fiscal to in fiscal in addition to the revenue mix  our gross margins were affected by the continuation of the global sourcing initiative  which is translating into lower product costs  and the increase in offerings of private label products that carry higher margins 
offsetting the gross margin expansion associated with global sourcing and increased private label products were the continued pricing and competitive pressures that we experienced in more of our commodity type products 
specialty segment gross profit increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in specialty segment gross profit was due to the increased revenues and gross margin improvement 
the basis point improvement from in fiscal to in fiscal was due primarily to the acquisition of delta 
essentials segment gross profit was up from million to million 
the increase in gross profit was related to the increased revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include selling expenses  the most significant of which are sales wages and commissions  operations expenses  which include customer service  warehouse and out bound freight costs  catalog costs  general administrative overhead  which includes information systems  accounting  legal and human resources  depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense 
sg a increased or million from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in sg a costs was due primarily to the incremental variable costs associated with the million incremental revenues  the fixed costs associated with the inclusion of delta and stock based compensation expense 
these increases were offset by cost reduction initiatives  which included headcount reductions  supply chain productivity enhancements and non recurring expenses incurred in fiscal specialty segment sg a increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal however  specialty segment sg a decreased as a percent of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sg a was due to the incremental four months of expenses related to the delta acquisition and stock based compensation expense of million 
the decrease in sg a as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to supply chain efficiencies  reduced catalog costs and headcount reductions 
the reduction in catalog costs was achieved through the optimization of the circulation which reduced the number of unproductive catalogs mailed 
the headcount reductions were primarily related to the integration of delta 
essentials segment sg a decreased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues for fiscal the decrease was primarily related to a headcount reduction as a result of sales force integration 
in addition  there was a reduction in supply chain costs as the essentials segment revenue shifted towards a higher mix of furniture which is shipped to the customers directly from the company s vendors 
these decreases were partially offset by increased marketing costs associated with the company s school smart brand and million of stock based compensation expense 
corporate sg a decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was related to non recurring charges in fiscal related to the closure of the southaven  mississippi distribution center and reduction in headcount 
these reductions were partially offset by planned investments in technology and million of stock based compensation expense 
terminated merger costs during fiscal  the company incurred million of accounting  legal and other transaction related costs associated with the terminated merger 
net interest expense net interest expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding  offset to some extent by a lower effective borrowing rate attributable to the company s november  sale of million principal amount of subordinated debentures due at an interest rate of 
the company used the proceeds of this debt offering to pay down its higher rate revolver debt and to repurchase shares of the company s common stock under its share repurchase program 
other expense other expense  which primarily consists of the discount and loss on the accounts receivable securitization  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million increase in the discount and loss was primarily due to the increased average securitized receivables primarily related to the delta acquisition as well an increase in the effective discount rate on the accounts receivable securitization 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to higher pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the reduction between years is related to a decrease in state and foreign income taxes offset by the tax treatment of incentive stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of in both years primarily due to the impact of state and foreign taxes 
fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks the following discussion and analysis of fiscal results compared to fiscal results  is based on a comparison of the company s results of operations from continuing operations 
overview of fiscal on august   the company acquired delta education  llc delta for an aggregate purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
the business operates from nashua  new hampshire and is the exclusive publisher of inquiry based hands on science curriculum for the elementary school market developed by the university of california  berkeley 
its products include comprehensive science kits  books  instructional materials and education software 
this business was merged with our existing science business  frey scientific 
as part of the transaction  we also acquired delta s educators publishing service division  a supplemental publisher of reading titles for grades k which integrated into our existing publishing business 
the results of this acquisition have been included in the specialty segment since the date of acquisition 
revenues for fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal the revenue growth was driven by the acquisition of delta  partially offset by the impact of an extra week of revenues in fiscal and a modest decline in revenues in both segments 
we believe the modest decline in revenues was the result of schools unexpectedly increasing their expenditures on fuel and health related costs  which conversely reduced funds available and consequently their spending on supplemental education products and equipment 
we continued to drive our product mix to higher margin proprietary products  with the specialty segment representing of revenues in fiscal as compared with in fiscal this shift in product mix to higher margin specialty products expanded gross margins to from

gross profit gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in revenues and improved gross margins mainly related to a shift in revenues to the higher gross margin specialty segment and a decrease in product costs through the direct sourcing of product from overseas channels 
gross margin improved basis points to of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in sales of higher margin proprietary products by the specialty segment as a percentage of overall sales mix  reduced costs of products associated with our global sourcing initiative and price expansion in the essentials segment  particularly in the furniture lines 
specialty segment gross profit increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in specialty segment gross profit was due to the aforementioned increased revenues and gross margin improvement 
the basis point improvement in gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily driven by acquired businesses  which have a higher gross margin than the average gross margin of our existing specialty segment businesses

our credit facility matures on february  and provides for million of revolving loan availability and million incremental term loan availability 
the amount outstanding as of april  under the revolving and incremental term loans was million and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
our borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital requirements of our peak selling season 
as of april   our effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was approximately  which excludes amortization of loan origination and commitment fees on unborrowed funds 
during fiscal  we incurred commitment fees on unborrowed funds under the credit facility of million and amortized loan origination fee costs of million 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a consolidated total and senior leverage ratio  a consolidated fixed charge ratio and a limitation on capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at april  the million  convertible subordinated notes became convertible during the second quarter of fiscal as the closing price of the company s common stock exceeded for the specified amount of time 
as a result  holders of the notes may surrender the notes for conversion at any time from october  until july  the notes are recorded as a current liability 
holders that exercise their right to convert the notes will receive up to the accreted principal amount in cash  with the balance of the conversion obligation  if any  to be satisfied in shares of company common stock or cash  at the company s discretion 
no notes have been converted into cash or shares of common stock as of april  the notes can be redeemed at the option of the company no earlier than august  net cash provided by operating activities increased million from million in fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to the increased net income 
partially offsetting the increase was an increased aging of our accounts receivable associated with the mix towards furniture revenues which historically have longer collection times  increased inventory in preparation of the upcoming season  and the liquidation of the acquired working capital of delta last year 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities  primarily related to incremental income taxes payable attributable to the increased net income

in connection with any such conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of debentures to be converted and our total conversion obligation  and will deliver  at our option  cash or shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
the initial conversion rate is shares per  principal amount of debentures  which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the debentures are redeemable at our option on or after november  on november   and and upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  holders will have the right to require us to repurchase all or some of the debentures

purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions 
common stock acquired through the share repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures and our contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately to million and to consist primarily of computer hardware and software costs related to the continued implementation of the new enterprise resource planning platform and warehouse equipment costs 
we expect our investment in product development to be approximately to million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable securitization facility 
the facility expires january  and it may be extended further with the financial institution s consent 
the facility permits advances up to million from july through november of each year  and advances up to million from december through june of each year 
we entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing our variable rate interest expense 
at april  and april   respectively  million was advanced under the accounts receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheets 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for the fiscal years  and were  and million  respectively 
the increase in these costs was related to higher average balance of accounts receivable securitized due to the increase in the advance limits permitted by the facility 
these costs are included as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations

the notes can be redeemed at the option of the company no earlier than november  the amounts reflected for these notes include accrued interest at the balance sheet date and interest at through november  as of april   we did not have any material long term purchase obligations 
the short term purchase obligations the company had as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course of business 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and in thousands  except per share data 
we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks revenues gross profit operating income loss earnings loss from continuing operations  net of income taxes earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss basic earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations total diluted earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations total fiscal first second third fourth total weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks revenues gross profit operating income loss earnings loss from continuing operations  net of income taxes earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss basic earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations total diluted earnings per share of common stock earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations total on august   we acquired delta  a seasonal business that generated operating and net losses during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal fiscal includes the results of delta for all quarters listed 
inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 
catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of our products which can include a master copy of a book  video or other media  on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in net development costs on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with our publishing  science and visual media businesses 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized development costs of million to expense related to our continuing businesses 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
during fiscal we recorded a million impairment charge related to product development costs at our ssm business unit in addition to a million impairment charge related to product development costs at ssm recorded in fiscal goodwill and intangible assets  and long lived assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
determining the recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes judgments regarding financial projections  including forecasted cash flows and discount rates  and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgments related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
during fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge  a million intangible asset impairment charge and a million impairment of property  plant and equipment related to the ssm business unit in addition to a million goodwill impairment charge related to ssm recorded in fiscal as of april   no remaining goodwill or intangible assets were recorded as assets related to ssm 
the impairment was the result of deteriorating financial performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized the sale of ssm and we have reflected ssm as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher during fiscal  pre tax earnings would have decreased by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million
