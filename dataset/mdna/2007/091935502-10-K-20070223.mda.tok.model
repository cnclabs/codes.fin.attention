item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under risks related to our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
general we are a leading provider of enterprise software applications and related services to the education industry 
our clients use our software to integrate technology into the education experience and campus life  and to support activities such as a professor assigning digital materials on a class website  a student collaborating with peers or completing research online  an administrator managing a departmental website  or a merchant conducting cash free transactions with students and faculty through pre funded debit accounts 
our clients include colleges  universities  schools and other education providers  as well as textbook publishers and student focused merchants who serve these education providers and their students 
we generate revenues from sales and licensing of products and from professional services 
our product revenues consist principally of revenues from annual software licenses  client hosting engagements and the sale of bundled software hardware systems 
we typically sell our licenses and hosting services under annually renewable agreements  and our clients generally pay the annual fees at the beginning of the contract term 
we recognize revenues from these agreements  as well as revenues from bundled software hardware systems  which do not recur  ratably over the contractual term  which is typically months 
billings associated with licenses and hosting services are recorded initially as deferred revenues and then recognized ratably into revenues over the contract term 
we also generate product revenues from the sale and licensing of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with our software 
these revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of the products to our clients 
we derive professional services revenues primarily from training  implementation  installation and other consulting services 
substantially all of our professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed 
we typically license our individual applications either on a stand alone basis or bundled as part of either of two suites  the blackboard academic suite tm and the blackboard commerce suite tm 
the blackboard academic suite includes the products formerly known as webct campus edition tm and webct vista tm  which were acquired in our merger with webct  inc we generally price our software licenses on the basis of full time equivalent students or users 
accordingly  annual license fees are generally greater for larger institutions 
our operating expenses consist of cost of product revenues  cost of professional services revenues  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
major components of our cost of product revenues include license and other fees that we owe to third parties upon licensing software  and the cost of hardware that we bundle with our software 
we initially defer these costs and recognize them into expense over the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization of internally developed technology available for sale  employee compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for personnel supporting our hosting  support and production functions  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities  depreciation expense and cost of external professional services used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with software are also expensed when incurred  normally upon delivery to our client 
cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
cost of professional services revenues primarily includes the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees and external consultants who are involved in the performance of professional services engagements for our clients  as well as travel and related costs  facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the creation and testing of the products we offer  as well as the costs of external professional services  travel and related costs attributable to the creation and testing of our products  related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses include the costs of compensation  including bonuses and commissions  stock based compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the generation of revenues  as well as marketing expenses  costs of external marketing related professional services  investor relations  facility rent  utilities  communications  travel attributable to those sales and marketing employees in the generation of revenues and bad debt expense 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees in the human resources  legal  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  executive management and other administrative functions that are not directly associated with the generation of revenues or the creation and testing of products 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include the costs of external professional services and insurance  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of costs associated with products  acquired technology  customer lists  non compete agreements and other identifiable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were recorded at the time of our acquisitions and relate to contractual agreements  technology and products that we continue to utilize in our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
during the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  fixed assets  long lived assets  including purchase accounting and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from two sources product sales and professional services sales 
product revenues include software license  hardware  premium support and maintenance  and hosting revenues 
professional services revenues include training and consulting services 
we recognize software license and maintenance revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software does not require significant modification and customization services 
where services are not essential to the functionality of the software  we begin to recognize software licensing revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for our support and maintenance separate from our software 
accordingly  when licenses are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance  we recognize the license revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we sell hardware in two types of transactions sales of hardware in conjunction with our software licenses  which we refer to as bundled hardware software systems  and sales of hardware without software  which generally involve the resale of third party hardware 
after any necessary installation services are performed  hardware revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we have not determined vsoe of the fair value for the separate components of bundled hardware software systems 
accordingly  when a bundled hardware software system is sold  all revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance service period 
hardware sales without software are recognized upon delivery of the hardware to our client 
hosting revenues are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
we recognize hosting fees and set up fees ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
we recognize professional services revenues  which are generally contracted on a time and materials basis and consist of training  implementation and installation services  as the services are provided 
we do not offer specified upgrades or incrementally significant discounts 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenues until the product is shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met and the revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced over amounts recognized as revenues 
we provide non specified upgrades of our product only on a when and if available basis 
any contingencies  such as rights of return  conditions of acceptance  warranties and price protection  are accounted for under sop the effect of accounting for these contingencies included in revenue arrangements has not been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
short term investments 
all investments with original maturities of greater than days are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity under the effective interest method 
such amortization is recorded as interest income 
interest on held to maturity securities is recorded as interest income 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses  if any  reported in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are recorded as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate these assets by examining estimated future cash flows to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
we evaluate these cash flows by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill and intangible assets 
as the result of acquisitions  any excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions may be subject to change 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually on october  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
the costs of defending and protecting patents are capitalized 
all costs incurred to the point when a patent application is to be filed is expensed as incurred 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets acquired technology years contracts and customer lists to years non compete agreements term of agreement trademarks and domain names years patents and related costs life of patent on february   we completed our merger with webct pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of october  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of webct in a cash transaction for approximately million 
the effective cash purchase price of webct before transaction costs was approximately million  net of webct s february  cash balance of approximately million 
we have included the financial results of webct in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of february  the total purchase price was million  including the acquisition related transaction costs of approximately million 
acquisition related transaction costs include investment banking  legal and accounting fees  and other external costs directly related to the merger 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total estimated purchase price as shown in the table below was allocated to webct s net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of february  the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price was based upon a valuation and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change 
the areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate primarily to income and non income based taxes 
in addition  upon the finalization of the combined company s legal entity structure  additional adjustments to deferred taxes may be required 
based on independent third party valuations  and other factors as described above  the estimated purchase price was allocated as follows in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable  net prepaid expenses and other current assets property and equipment  net deferred tax assets  net accounts payable other accrued liabilities deferred revenues net tangible assets to be acquired definite lived intangible assets acquired goodwill total estimated purchase price of the total estimated purchase price  million has been allocated to net tangible assets and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets of million consist of the value assigned to webct s customer relationships of million and developed and core technology of million 
the value assigned to webct s customer relationships was determined by discounting the estimated cash flows associated with the existing customers as of the acquisition date taking into consideration expected attrition of the existing customer base 
the estimated cash flows were based on revenues for those existing customers net of operating expenses and net contributory asset charges associated with servicing those customers 
the estimated revenues were based on revenue growth rates and customer renewal rates 
operating expenses were estimated based on the supporting infrastructure expected to sustain the assumed revenue growth rates 
net contributory asset charges were based on the estimated fair value of those assets that contribute to the generation of the estimated cash flows 
a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for valuing the existing customer base 
we are amortizing the value of customer relationships proportionally to the respective discounted cash flows over an estimated useful life of five years 
customer relationships are not deductible for tax purposes 
developed and core technology  which is comprised of products that have reached technological feasibility  includes products in webct s product line 
the value assigned to webct s developed and core technology was determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the existing and core technologies to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the developed and core technology were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows of developed and core technology to their present value were based on the risks associated with the respective cash flows taking into consideration our weighted average cost of capital 
a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for valuing developed and core technology 
we are amortizing the developed and core technology on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of three years 
developed and core technology are not deductible for tax purposes 
of the total estimated purchase price  approximately million has been allocated to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
as a result of the webct acquisition  we recorded net deferred tax assets of approximately million in purchase accounting 
this balance is comprised primarily of million of deferred tax assets related to federal net operating losses  capitalized research and development  and certain amortization and depreciation expenses 
the deferred tax assets are offset by million in deferred tax liabilities resulting primarily from the related intangibles identified from the acquisition and the reduction in webct deferred revenues resulting from purchase accounting 
in connection with the purchase price allocation  the estimated fair value of the support obligation assumed from webct in connection with the acquisition was determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs relating to fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligation were based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in webct software products 
these estimated costs did not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling efforts is excluded because webct had concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to february  the estimated normal profit margin was determined to be 
as a result  in allocating the acquisition purchase price  we recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of webct s february  deferred support revenue by approximately million to million which represents our estimate of the fair value of the support obligation assumed 
as former webct customers renew these support contracts  we will recognize revenue for the full value of the support contracts over the remaining term of the contracts  the majority of which are one year 
we have currently not identified any material pre acquisition contingencies where a liability is probable and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
if information becomes available prior to the end of the purchase price allocation period  which would indicate that it is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated  such items will be included in the purchase price allocation 
the unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes our combined results of operations and webct on a pro forma basis  as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of each of the periods presented 
the pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and borrowings under the our senior secured credit facilities with credit suisse see note of notes to consolidated financial statements had taken place as of the beginning of each of the periods presented 
the pro forma financial information for all periods presented also includes amortization expense from acquired intangible assets  adjustments to interest expense  interest income and related tax effects 
the unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended december  combines our historical results for the year ended december  and the historical results for webct for the period from january  to february  the unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended december  combines our historical results for the year ended december  and the historical results for webct for the same period 
in thousands  except per share amounts unaudited total revenues net income loss basic net income loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
income tax provision includes us federal  state and local income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
the provision or benefit for income taxes is based upon our estimate of our annual effective income tax rate 
in determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all equity based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all equity based payments granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our loss before benefit for income taxes and net loss for the year ended december  were approximately million and million more  respectively  than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december  were each approximately more than if we had not adopted sfas r 
the related total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations was approximately million for the year ended december  and is classified as financing cash flows 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under our option plans 
the cost is expected to be recognized through february with a weighted average recognition period of approximately years 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
important factors considered by management we consider several factors in evaluating both our financial position and our operating performance 
these factors  while primarily focused on relevant financial information  also include other measures such as general market and economic conditions  competitor information and the status of the regulatory environment 
to understand our financial results  it is important to understand our business model and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for the majority of our contracts requires us to initially record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet upon invoicing the sale and then to recognize revenue in subsequent periods ratably over the term of the contract in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  to better understand our operations  one must look at both revenues and deferred revenues 
in evaluating our revenues  we analyze them in three categories recurring ratable revenues  non recurring ratable revenues and other revenues 
recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year  and that recur each year assuming clients renew their contracts 
these revenues include revenues from the licensing of all of our software products  hosting arrangements and enhanced support and maintenance contracts related to our software products  including certain professional services performed by our professional services groups 
non recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year  but that do not contractually recur 
these revenues include certain hardware components of our blackboard transaction system products and certain third party hardware and software sold to our clients in conjunction with our software licenses 
other revenues include those revenues that are recognized as earned and are not deferred to future periods 
these revenues include professional services  the sales of blackboard one  as well as the supplies and commissions we earn from publishers related to digital course supplement downloads 
in the case of both recurring ratable revenues and non recurring ratable revenues  an increase or decrease in the revenues in one period would be attributable primarily to increases or decreases in sales in prior periods 
unlike recurring ratable revenues  which benefit both from new license sales and from the renewal of previously existing licenses  non recurring ratable revenues primarily reflect one time sales that do not contractually renew 
other factors that we consider in making strategic cash flow and operating decisions include cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  total operating expenses and earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues product professional services total revenues operating expenses cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions total operating expenses operating margin the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to total revenues of million for the year ended december  a detail of our total revenues by classification is as follows product professional product professional revenues services revenues total revenues services revenues total in millions unaudited recurring ratable revenues non recurring ratable revenues other revenues total revenues product revenues 
product revenues  including domestic and international  for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  recurring ratable product revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  product revenues from the blackboard academic suite increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase in blackboard academic suite revenues was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from blackboard learning system enterprise products  a million increase in revenue from blackboard content system licenses and a million increase in revenue from blackboard community system licenses 
product revenues from the blackboard commerce suite increased by million due to an increase in revenues from blackboard transaction system licenses 
the further increase in recurring ratable product revenues was due to a million increase in hosting revenues and a million increase in revenues from enhanced support and maintenance revenues related to our software products 
these increases in recurring ratable product revenues were attributable to current and prior period sales to new and existing clients  including clients resulting from the webct merger 
as of december   we had a increase in the number of clients as compared to december   primarily as a result of the webct acquisition 
further  during  our clients renewed or upgraded approximately of the renewable license dollars eligible to be renewed during  which was consistent with the increase in blackboard learning system enterprise product revenue was also attributable to the continued shift from the blackboard learning system basic products to the blackboard learning system enterprise products and cross selling other enterprise products to existing clients 
the blackboard learning system enterprise products have additional functionality that is not available in the blackboard learning system basic products and consequently some blackboard learning system basic product clients upgrade to the blackboard learning system enterprise products 
licenses of the enterprise version of the blackboard learning system enterprise products have higher average pricing  which normally results in at least twice the contractual value as compared to blackboard learning system basic product licenses 
the increase in non recurring ratable product revenues was primarily due to an increase in non recurring third party hardware and software revenues 
the increase in other product revenues was primarily due to a million increase in publisher revenues attributable to webct publisher relationships  a  increase in non ratable  non recurring third party hardware and software revenues and a  increase in blackboard one revenues due to an increase in current period sales 
of our total revenues  our total international revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  international product revenues  which consist primarily of recurring ratable product revenues  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in international revenues was driven primarily by an increase in recurring ratable product revenues 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in international revenues from blackboard academic suite products resulting from prior period sales to new and existing clients 
the increase in international blackboard academic suite revenues was primarily attributable to the same factors that contributed to the increase in overall blackboard academic suite revenues 
the further increase in total international revenues was attributable to an increase in professional services revenues due to the increase in the number of international licensees of our blackboard academic suite products  which generally purchase greater volumes of our service offerings 
in addition  the increase in international revenues also reflects our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and international marketing efforts during prior periods  which expanded our international presence and enabled us to sell more of our products to new and existing clients in our international markets 
professional services revenues 
professional services revenues for the year ended december   were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in professional services revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number and size of service engagements  which was directly related to the increase in the number of licensees primarily associated with the webct merger  particularly in the number of enterprise product licensees  which generally purchase greater volumes of our service offerings and increased sales of certain enhanced support and maintenance services 
as a percentage of total revenues  professional services revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to for the year ended december  as a result of the fair value adjustment to the acquired webct deferred revenue balances  the percentage of professional services revenues was higher than in prior periods 
we do not expect this trend to continue in future periods and we expect the percentage of professional services revenues to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily due to a million increase in our technical support expense primarily due to increased personnel costs related to increased headcount related to new hires during and  higher average salaries due to annual salary increases in and the inclusion of webct s technical support groups 
in addition  there was a million increase in expenses for our hosting services due to the increase in the number of clients  including webct clients  contracting for our hosting services 
further  the increase was due to a million increase in third party hardware and software costs primarily associated with third party products sold with the blackboard transaction system and  in stock based compensation included in cost of product revenues for the year ended december  cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a result of the fair value adjustment to the acquired webct deferred revenue balances  the percentage of cost of product revenues was higher than in prior periods 
we do not expect this trend to continue in future periods and we expect the percentage of cost of product revenues to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
amortization expense related to acquired technology for the year ended december  was million 
there was no amortization expense related to acquired technology for the year ended december  cost of product revenues  including amortization of acquired technology  as a percentage of product revenues was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  cost of professional services revenues 
our cost of professional services revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of professional services revenues was directly related to the increase in professional services revenues 
cost of professional services revenues as a percentage of professional services revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in professional services revenues margin was primarily due to  in stock based compensation included in cost of professional services revenues for the year ended december  research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in personnel related costs due to increased headcount related to new hires during and  higher average salaries due to annual salary increases in and the inclusion of webct s research and development groups  including approximately million in severance costs 
in addition  there was a million increase in professional services costs resulting from our continued efforts to increase the functionality of our products 
further  for the year ended december  there was  in stock based compensation included in research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million or  as compared to sales and marketing expense of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs primarily due to increased headcount related to new hires during and  higher average salaries due to annual salary increases in and the inclusion of webct s sales and marketing groups 
further  there was a million increase in general marketing activities primarily associated with a larger annual blackboard users conference in february and webct users conference in july in addition  there was a million change in bad debt expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to a million reduction in bad debt expense recorded during the year ended december  as compared to  of bad debt expense recorded during the year ended december  further  there was million in stock based compensation included in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount related to new hires during and  higher average salaries across all general and administrative functional departments due to annual salary increases in and the inclusion of webct general and administrative functional departments  including approximately million in retention bonuses and severance costs primarily for webct employees 
further  there was an increase of approximately million in facility expenses  including rent  utilities  repairs and maintenance expenses  related to an increase in office space at our washington  dc headquarters and international locations during and  as well as the inclusion of webct office space in lynnfield  ma and canada 
there was an increase of approximately million in professional service expenses during the year ended december  primarily associated with increased legal  accounting and integration costs resulting from the acquisition of webct 
for the year ended december   there was million in stock based compensation included in general and administrative expenses

further  this change was due in part to lower cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulting from the use of cash for the acquisition of webct 
other expense 
our other expense for the year ended december  was  and pertains to the remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries ledgers  which are maintained in the local foreign currency  into the united states dollar

approximately million of this amount is restricted under section of the internal revenue code 
section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes  as defined by that section  occur 
we have performed an analysis of our section ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards subject to section will be limited to approximately million per year 
net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if unused  by the end of due to the length of time available to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and the likelihood of having sufficient taxable income in those periods  we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized

income taxes 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  for the first time in our history  we had generated cumulative earnings from operations for the three year period ended december  as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected operating results in the foreseeable future  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and accordingly  reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million 
this reduction resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit totaling million 
of the total income tax benefit recognized  approximately million related to a federal deferred tax benefit with the remainder representing a state deferred tax benefit 
we do not have an established history of earnings related to our international net operating loss carryforwards  primarily resulting from our operations in the netherlands  and therefore million in international net operating loss carryforwards continue to be fully reserved through a valuation allowance as of december  although we will continue to have significant net operating loss carryforwards which are expected to mitigate some of our cash tax expenditures over the next several years  we began recording  in  a provision for income taxes based on the appropriate effective tax rate 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for certain tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount is restricted under section of the internal revenue code 
section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes  as defined by that section  occur 
we have performed an analysis of our section ownership changes and determined that the utilization of some of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
this limitation will defer the utilization of approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards  which will be limited to approximately  per year and will expire  if unused  by the end of we believe we will have sufficient taxable income in those periods to utilize the available net operating loss carryforwards  and therefore we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  our net income for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  quarterly results our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as incurred  in our second and third quarters each year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
the following table sets forth selected statements of operations and cash flow data for each of the quarters in the years ended december  and quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses income from operations net income net cash used in provided by operating activities quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses loss income from operations net income loss net cash used in provided by operating activities for the first time in our history  we had generated cumulative earnings from operations for the three year period ended december  as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected operating results in the foreseeable future  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and accordingly  reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million 
this reduction resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of million for the quarter ended december  during the three months ended december   we adjusted our estimated forfeiture rate from approximately to approximately which resulted in a reduction of previously recorded compensation expense of approximately  liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the use of cash for the acquisition of webct 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  this change for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  which was primarily due to post acquisition merger related expenses including severance and integration costs resulting from the acquisition of webct 
accounts receivable increased million during the year ended december   net of accounts receivable assumed in the acquisition of webct of million  due to an increase in invoicing associated with increased sales to new and existing clients during as compared to these decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in deferred revenues primarily associated with the higher volume of new sales to new and existing clients and the higher level of renewing licenses during the year ended december  as compared to the fourth quarter of  offset by the recognition of revenues from prior period sales 
amortization of intangibles also increased as a result of our acquisition of webct 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  this increase in cash usage was primarily due to the million in net cash paid related to the acquisition of webct 
this increase was offset by the sale of million in short term investments to fund a portion of the acquisition of webct 
cash expenditures for purchase of property and equipment were million for the year ended december   which represents approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  we expect cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment to be approximately of revenues during the year ended december  due to the one time costs related to the re location of our corporate headquarters and expect these expenditures to return to the to range in future periods 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to the million in proceeds  net of million in debt issuance costs  associated with the credit facilities agreement we entered into with credit suisse to fund a portion of the acquisition of webct 
during the year ended december   we repaid the million revolving credit facility and million of the term loan facility 
we also received million in proceeds from exercise of stock options as compared to million for the year ended december  in connection with the acquisition of webct  we paid a portion of the purchase price using borrowings under a million senior secured credit facilities agreement with credit suisse 
the agreement provided for a million senior secured term loan facility repayable over six years and a million senior secured revolving credit facility due and payable in full at the end of five years 
the interest rate on the facilities will accrue at one of the following rates selected by us a adjusted libor plus or b an alternate base rate plus 
the alternate base rate is the higher of credit suisse s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
if we choose the adjusted libor interest rate option  interest payments would be due on the last day of the interest period one  two  three or six months as selected by us 
if we choose the alternate base rate interest rate option  interest payments would be due on the last day of each calendar quarter 
during march  we chose the alternate base rate interest rate option 
as of march   we changed to the adjusted libor interest rate option 
at december  the interest rate on the term loan facility was 
this interest rate does not reflect the impact of the amortization of debt issuance costs  discussed below  as interest expense 
we repaid million on the revolving credit facility on march  as of december   no amounts were outstanding on the revolving credit facility and million in borrowings were available 
we are required to pay a commitment fee  due at the end of each calendar quarter until the maturity date  equal to on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility as defined in the senior secured credit facilities agreement 
we record this fee in interest expense 
the senior secured credit facilities agreement allows for voluntary principal prepayments of principal and requires mandatory principal prepayments within days after calendar year end based on a calculation of excess cash flow as defined in the senior secured credit facilities agreement 
we do not expect any mandatory principal prepayments within days after year end based on the calculation of excess cash flow as defined in the senior secured credit facilities agreement 
we made scheduled principal payments on the term loan facility of  which were due on the last day of each quarter from march  through december  a principal payment in the amount of  is due on the last day of each quarter from march  through december  with a million principal payment each due on march  and june  and a million payment due on september  we prepaid million during each of august and december  and prepaid million during each of september  october and november  as of december   we had million outstanding on the term loan facility 
in connection with obtaining the senior secured credit facilities  we incurred million in debt issuance costs 
these costs  which are recorded as a debt discount  are netted against the remaining principal amount outstanding 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the senior secured credit facilities and such amortization has been adjusted for any prepayments on the term loan facility 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in additional interest expense associated with the acceleration in the amortization of the debt discount due to the prepayments of debt principal during totaling million 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of amortization of the debt discount as interest expense 
under the terms of the senior secured credit facilities agreement  the credit facilities are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by perfected first priority security interests in  and mortgages on  substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets including the capital stock of each specified subsidiary and each of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the facilities contain customary negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries with respect to our operations and financial condition  such as a maximum quarterly capital expenditure amount  a maximum interest coverage ratio and a minimum leverage ratio 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  available borrowings and future cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products or services  the timing of enhancements to existing products and services and the timing of capital expenditures 
also  we may make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
obligations and commitments as of december   minimum future payments under existing credit facilities and noncancelable operating leases and rental income from subleases are as follows for the years below credit operating sub lease facilities leases income in thousands and beyond total on december   we entered into an agreement with washington television center  llc pursuant to which we will lease approximately  square feet of office space in the building known as massachusetts avenue  washington  dc we will be relocating our corporate headquarters to the leased premises 
the lease term commences on the later of i eight months from the date on which the landlord delivers the leased premises to us and ii the date on which we occupy the leased premises 
the delivery date of the leased premises is anticipated to be june  and we anticipate that we will occupy the leased premises in late or early the base annual rent will initially be per rentable square foot and will increase on each anniversary by  except on the fifth anniversary on which it will increase by per square foot 
the rent for the first four months of the first lease year and the first two months of the second lease year will be abated 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as incurred  in our second and third quarters each year 
in addition  deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
historically  we have generated more of our operating cash flow in the second half of the calendar year 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new market opportunities or new product introductions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
at december   million was outstanding on our term loan facility with credit suisse  subject to covenants and restrictions 
the interest rate on the term loan facility accrues at one of the following rates selected by us a adjusted libor plus or b an alternate base rate plus 
the alternate base rate is the higher of credit suisse s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
at december   the interest rate on the term loan facility was 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of our debt obligation 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  interest income on our cash and cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have reduced our interest income by approximately  we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell products and services 
in particular  we have accounts recorded in the canadian dollar 
therefore  when the canadian dollar strengthens or weakens against the united states dollar  net income loss is increased or decreased  respectively 
as a result  other expense of  was recorded during the year ended december  for the year ended december   an one percentage point adverse change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar into the united states dollar as of december  would have increased our other expense by approximately
