item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we design  develop and market innovative liquid fuel cell products principally for the mobile handset and portable consumer electronics markets 
we are also working to develop and commercialize some of the other technologies we own or own the rights to  including the cellscan  which is a static cytometer an instrument for measuring reactions of living cells while the cells are in a static state  with particular concentration on expanding the versatility of and business opportunities for the cell carrier  and a device that if successfully developed would be able to detect certain explosive materials 
research and development activities for our remaining technologies have recently been curtailed or stopped  based upon our decision to devote more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing fuel cell based products 
in recent years we have increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts including our capital expenditures for the establishment of our production facilities  which we expect will continue until such time as we successfully commercialize our first fuel cell products  of which we can give no assurance  and perhaps thereafter 
results of operations from our inception in april through december   we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  including approximately  from amortization expense 
we expect to incur additional operating losses during and possibly thereafter  principally as a result of our continuing anticipated research and development costs  increases in selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses related to the introduction of our products  cost related to commercialization of our fuel cell products and the uncertainty of bringing our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies to commercial success 
since our inception  we have relied principally on outside sources of funding to finance our operations  as our revenues have been minimal 
in november and december  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of  per share for gross proceeds of  less issuance costs of approximately  additionally  in july and august  we issued  aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due july convertible notes  less issuance costs of approximately  all of which was exchanged for shares of our common stock in april and may see discussion below 
although we have received our first three purchase orders for our civilian power pack product which together provide for large scale delivery during our first two years of product availability  we will not derive any revenues under the purchase orders unless and until we commence large scale manufacturing of our first fuel cell product 
we intend for our fully automated production line  operated by a third party contract manufacturer  to be qualified for high volume production in the second quarter of  and during the second half of  we plan to ramp up production of the units  from hundreds of thousands of units per month and increasing to million units per month 
until such time  we expect our reliance on outside sources of funding to continue until we are able to successfully commercialize our fuel cell or any of our other products or technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
our research and development costs have increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  as we have continued to devote greater efforts to develop the technology underlying  and commercialize the products incorporating  our fuel cells  however  if we are unable to successfully commercially develop our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies  we will be forced to curtail our spending levels until such time  if ever  as we generate revenues or otherwise receive funds from third party sources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increases in the net loss can primarily be attributed to charges to interest expense aggregating approximately  related to the exchanges in april and may of our common stock for all of our outstanding convertible notes and increases in research and development costs primarily due to increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts as we move towards commercialization of our fuel cell products 
additionally  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as more fully described below 
as we approach final stages of the anticipated commercialization of our fuel cell products  we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and research and development costs for our fuel cell products 
we recognized revenues of  and cost of revenues of  during the year ended december   compared to revenues of  and cost of revenues of  during the year ended december  the revenues in both years are attributable to completed orders that we received from general dynamics c systems  inc  a unit of general dynamics corporation relating to our fuel cell products and technology 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in research and development costs incurred during the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  related to our fuel cell technologies 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development expenses related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  reflects our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products as we move towards commercialization and result from increases in labor  materials  depreciation and other costs 
cell kinetics cellscan 
we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december  relating to the further refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan  on various research activities including modifying the cell carrier design to enable its use with standard fluorescence microscopes and in obtaining the ce mark and moving forward with our iso application  as well as clarifying other regulatory requirements needed for further commercialization of our products  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  for further refinement of the desktop cellscan system and on various research activities 
the increases in our cellscan related research and development costs during the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to increases materials costs for the assembly of additional desktop cellscans  labor costs including new cell carrier design costs and cell carrier coating development and other expenses  partially offset by a decrease in costs of subcontractors and consultants 
other r d activities 
we have been devoting more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing our fuel cell based products 
as a result  other than as described above with respect to the cellscan  we have been devoting few resources to many of our other technologies 
we have  however  been working to develop a device to detect certain explosive materials 
after performing preliminary testing of the device  we have made various changes in the device and continue to test different iterations with a view to exploiting our technology by developing a commercial product 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december   amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  year ended december  the increases of  for the year ended december   is primarily attributable to increases in non cash charges relating to the issuance of stock options of approximately  resulting principally from our adoption of sfas r on january   increases in costs for the issuance and maintenance of patents and other professional fees of approximately  increases in insurance costs of approximately  increases in depreciation expense of approximately  increases in executive consulting costs of approximately  increase in selling and marketing costs of approximately  and net increases in various other sg a cost categories of approximately  partially offset by decreases in labor and related costs of approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  for each of the years ended december  and december  the amortization of intangible assets in both periods represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy ltd

net interest income and expenses during year ended december  amounted to net other expenses of approximately  compared to net other expense of approximately  during the year ended december  the difference of  between the years is due to an increase in interest expense of  partially offset by increases in interest income of  the increase in interest expense during the year ended december  is principally due to aggregate costs of approximately  recorded as interest expense in connection with the april and may exchanges of our common stock for our then outstanding convertible notes consisting of the value of the shares issued in lieu of future interest payments of approximately  the amortization of the remaining balance of the beneficial conversion features of approximately  and out of pocket costs incurred in connection with the exchange transactions partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred on our convertible notes prior to their exchange of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in interest income during the year ended december  of  is primarily due to increases in our average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances in compared to the same period in resulting principally from the proceeds of our issuance of our convertible notes in july and august and our series a preferred stock in november and december  as well as increases in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and  credited to interest income upon the exercise of a day option to acquire up to an additional  of our series a preferred stock that was granted to the initial purchaser in connection with the issuance in november of the first  of series a preferred stock 
effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r and related securities and exchange commission rules included in staff accounting bulletin no 
 on a modified prospective basis 
as a result of adopting sfas r  our net loss for the year ended december   is  greater than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the net loss can primarily be attributed to increases in research and development costs primarily due to increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts as we move towards commercialization of our fuel cell products 
furthermore  during the year ended december  we incurred net increases in other expense which can be attributed to interest on our convertible notes that were issued in july and august  partially offset by increased interest income earned on our cash balances and short term investments 
these factors were somewhat offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  as more fully described below 
as we get closer to the anticipated commercialization of our fuel cell products  we expect that we will continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and research and development costs for our fuel cell products 
during the year ended december   we recorded revenues of  and cost of revenues of  compared to none during the year ended december  the revenues recorded in are attributable to an august order from general dynamics  pursuant to which we completed delivery of power packs and refueling cartridges to general dynamics during the fourth quarter of research and development costs  net amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in research and development costs incurred during compared to  can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  in costs related to our fuel cell technologies 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development expenses related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  reflects our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products as we move towards commercialization and result from increases in labor  subcontractor  materials and other costs 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the further refinement of the desktop cellscan system and on various research activities of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december   for various research activities  refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan 
the decrease in costs can in part be attributed to our decision to devote more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing fuel cell based products 
other r d activities 
we have been devoting more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing our fuel cell based products 
as a result  we have been devoting few resources to many of our other technologies 
we have  however  been working to develop a device to detect certain explosive materials 
after performing preliminary testing of the device in  we have made various changes in the device and continue to test different iterations with a view to exploiting our technology by developing a commercial product 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to  compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease of  for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decrease in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants of approximately  and a decrease in costs related to the issuance and maintenance of patents of approximately  offset by an increase in labor and executive consulting costs of approximately  an increase in professional fees of approximately  an increase in office expenses of approximately  and increase in depreciation expense on leasehold improvement of approximately  an increase in a non cash charge related to a reserve for a refund of land development costs of approximately  an increase in sales and marketing expense of approximately  an increase in insurance costs of approximately  and a net increase in various other sg a cost categories of approximately amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the each of the years ended december  and december  the amortization of intangible assets in both periods represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy ltd 
that we did not already own 
net other income and expenses during the year ended december  amounted to a net other expenses of approximately  compared to a net other income of approximately  during the year ended december  the difference of  between the years ended december  and is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  somewhat offset by an increase in interest income of approximately  during the same comparative periods 
the increase in interest expense described above is principally due to our july and august issuance of  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due july  related to which we recorded interest expense aggregating approximately  comprised of  on the coupon rate   representing amortization of debt issuance costs and  representing amortization of beneficial conversion features during the increase in interest income during the year ended december  as compared to is primarily due to an increase in our cash balances and short term investments in resulting from our issuance of our convertible notes 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through the proceeds of investor equity financing 
in november and december  we issued series a preferred stock to qualified institutional investors in a private offering 
in july and august  we issued convertible notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers and in april and may exchanged our common stock for our outstanding convertible notes 
we expect to continue to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity until such time as we successfully commercialize our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies 
our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to the progress of research and development programs  the status of our technologies  and the level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies  patents  marketing and sales capabilities 
the amount of resources required to complete our production facilities and product launch 
our anticipation  based on our current expectation that we will sell out the production capacity of our first fully automated production line  that we will undertake to build a second fully automated 
another source of income or other means to affect our cash expenditures are collaborative arrangements with businesses and institutes for research and development and companies participating in the development of our technologies 
since january  we have realized revenues of  on costs of revenues of  as well as credits against our research and development costs of approximately  with respect to collaborative arrangements with third parties relating to our fuel cell technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will realize additional revenue or credits to our research and development expense from collaborative arrangements 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will raise additional funds through any financing approach implemented by us 
in july and august  we issued  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes in a private placement  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  interest on our convertible notes was payable quarterly 
the convertible notes were issued at par 
our convertible notes did not have the benefit of any sinking fund and were convertible prior to maturity or redemption into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of our convertible notes or an initial conversion price of per share 
our convertible notes were callable by us after two years if the closing price of our stock for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days immediately prior to the notification date of such redemption exceeded  subject to adjustment 
of the total  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes issued   aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes were issued pursuant to the exercise of a day option that was granted to the initial purchaser in connection with the issuance of the first  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes 
the remaining  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes were issued and sold directly to a group of affiliated investors in a private placement 
on april   we completed an exchange of our common stock for our outstanding convertible notes whereby the holders of an aggregate of  in principal amount of the convertible notes exchanged their convertible notes for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
such number of shares  which aggregated of our then issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to this transaction  includes  shares  valued at per share  in lieu of future interest payments had our convertible notes remained outstanding until their maturity  after giving effect to an eighteen month waiver of such payments 
on may   we completed a second exchange of our common stock for our outstanding convertible notes whereby the holders of the remaining  in principal amount of the convertible notes exchanged their convertible notes for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
such number of shares includes  shares of our common stock  valued at per share  in lieu of future interest payments had such convertible notes remained outstanding until their maturity  after giving effect to an eighteen month waiver of such payments 
in november and december  we issued  shares of our series a preferred stock in a private offering for aggregate gross proceeds of  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  the annual cash dividend on each share of our series a preferred stock is and is payable quarterly  in arrears  commencing on february  each share of our series a preferred stock is convertible at the holder s option at any time into shares of our common stock which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
on or after november   if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for trading days during any consecutive trading day period  we may cause the conversion of our series a preferred stock into common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate 
of the total  of our series a preferred stock issued   was issued pursuant to the exercise of a day option that was granted to the initial purchaser in connection with the issuance of the first  of our series a preferred stock 
on november   concurrent with our offering of our series a preferred stock  we issued million shares of our common stock in an offering registered under the securities act of the shares of common stock issued were loaned to an affiliate of citigroup global markets limited cgml under a year share lending agreement 
the only consideration that we received was a share lending fee of 
per share  or an aggregate of  the loaned shares were used by cgml to promote the sale of our series a preferred stock by facilitating hedging transactions that may be undertaken by purchasers of our series a preferred stock in the private offering described above 
during the year ended december   option holders exercised outstanding options issued under our stock option plan  as amended  to acquire  shares of our common stock including  shares exercised by our executive officers  for aggregate proceeds of approximately  of which  was received in subsequent to december  
during the year ended december   warrant holders exercised outstanding warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of approximately  proceeds from our series a preferred stock and debt financings and other proceeds have been and will continue to be used for corporate expense and capital expenditures  including for the construction  start up and other costs related to a fully automated manufacturing line for our fuel cell products  as well as for other working capital purposes  and selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses 
as of december   commitments for capital expenditures in aggregated approximately  which primarily relate to the completion of our fully automated production line and related facilities 
during the year ended december   on a limited basis  we entered into forward exchange contracts and participating forward exchange contracts in order to hedge the risk of variability of cash flows related to payments for the construction of our automated production line  which are denominated in swiss francs  and contractual payments denominated in euro 
as of december   we had no open forward exchange contracts or participating forward exchange contract 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development costs related to our fuel cell technologies reflecting our decision to continue to increase funding of such activities as we move towards commercialization of our fuel cell products  interest payments on our convertible notes see above discussion of the exchange in april and may of our common stock for all of our outstanding convertible notes  an increase in selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  as described above  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets representing materials for the production of medis power pack products and advance payments to suppliers  partially offset by an increase in interest income 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represented i purchases of property and equipment of  of which approximately  represents costs related to building and equipping our fully automated and semi automated production lines and related facilities  and ii investments in short term investments of  less redemptions of short term investments of  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represents the following i capital expenditures of  of which approximately  represents costs related to building and equipping our fully automated and semi automated production lines and related facilities and approximately  of leasehold improvement and equipment costs related to our move to our new facility in lod  israel  ii investments in short term investments of  less redemptions of short term investments of  and iii long term loans granted in the amount of  for the year ended december   cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities  compared to  for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was generated from i proceeds from our issuance of our series a preferred stock of  less issuance costs of approximately  paid during the year needed december  and less  allocated to the allocated to the over allotment option granted to the initial purchaser  net  as described more fully above  ii proceeds of approximately  of which  was received by us subsequent to december  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock including  shares exercised by our executive officers  and iii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants  and iv  received as consideration in our share lending agreement  pursuant to which we lent  shares of our common stock to the initial purchaser of our series a preferred stock see discussion above 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  aggregating  was generated from i net proceeds of approximately  from our issuance in july and august of our  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  ii net proceeds of approximately  from a private placement to an accredited investor in january of  shares of our common stock  iii net proceeds of approximately  from a private placement to an accredited investor in april of  shares of our common stock  iv proceeds of approximately  of which  was received by us subsequent to december  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock including  shares exercised by our executive officers upon the exercise of stock options issued under our stock option plan  and v proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants including  shares exercised by a corporation beneficially owned by our chief executive officer and our deputy chairman and chief operating officer and  shares exercised by our chief executive officer and our deputy chairman and chief operating officer 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and  in short term investments 
while we expect our cash outlays to increase as we continue to pay for our fully automated production line  we expect our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately  to be sufficient for completion of our fully automated production line and related facilities and operating requirements during the ramp up of our fully automated production line until we are able to finance our operations from the sales of our power pack product and related working capital financing if necessary 
we intend for our fully automated production line  operated by a third party contract manufacturer  to be qualified for high volume production in the second quarter of  and during the second half of  we plan to ramp up production of the units  from hundreds of thousands of units per month and increasing to million units per month 
however  we can give no assurance that we will not need additional capital in completing our production capability and during the ramp up of such capability 
our failure to successfully commercialize or sell our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies would require us to seek outside sources of financing to raise additional funds for working capital or other purposes 
however  such failure may materially adversely affect our ability to raise such additional funds if needed 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to complete the development of our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies or market and produce our fuel cell products 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december payment due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligation purchase obligations other long term liabilities note total note other long term liabilities represents our accrued severance pay as of december  since we do not expect a high level of employee turnover giving rise to the payment of significant amounts of severance obligations  we have included approximately of the total liability in each of the years through and the remainder in and thereafter 
tax matters as of december   for us federal income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for israeli income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  since our inception  we have not had any taxable income 
the availability of our us net operating loss carry forwards may be reduced to the extent one or more direct or indirect holders of or greater amount of our common stock increases their equity interest in us by more than in the aggregate 
grants obtained from the state of israel medis el  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  received approximately  in research and development grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of commerce and industry of the state of israel from its inception to this is based upon a policy of the government of israel to provide grants of between and of qualifying approved research and development expenditures to promote research and development by israeli companies 
medis el received of qualifying approved research and development expenditures  with  of such funds being allotted for the cellscan and  allotted for the neuritor 
pursuant to the grant arrangement  medis el is required to pay of its sales of cellscan and neuritor products developed with the grant funds until the grant amounts are paid in full 
there is no requirement to repay the grants if the products developed with the grant funds are not sold 
if medis el sells the underlying technology prior to repaying the grant funds  it must first seek permission from the israeli government for such sale 
prior to medis el receiving grant funds in  medis el assumed from israel aerospace industries ltd 
formerly known as israel aircraft industries ltd  our largest stockholder  its obligation relating to the repayment of grants out of future royalties  if any  of approximately  as of december   medis el s total contingent obligation for the repayment of grants  which includes the  is  neither we nor medis el presently receive any grants from the state of israel 
approved enterprise under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   medis el was issued a certificate of approval as an approved enterprise 
under the law  medis el elected the combined path  pursuant to which medis el had the right to receive a government guaranteed bank loan of of the amount of the approved investment 
in addition  medis el had the right to receive a grant of of the approved investment  in which case the loan would be reduced by the amount of the grant 
medis el received investment grants of approximately  and loans of approximately  the investment grants were used to invest in equipment  furniture and fixtures and commercial vehicles 
the loan proceeds were used for the above as well as to acquire know how  leasehold improvements  marketing and working capital 
the loans were paid off in full during the year ended december  additionally  through medis el would have been subject to tax in respect of its income deriving from its approved enterprise activities is calculated at a rate of of income for a ten year period  with tax on dividends distributed of  instead of 
these tax benefits expired in in september  more energy  our fuel cell subsidiary  was granted approved enterprise status 
the plan provides a two year tax exemption  as well as reduced tax for a period of years 
the benefits from the approved enterprise programs depend upon more energy fulfilling the conditions under the letter of approval and the laws governing the grant 
the commencement of the benefits period is determined beginning with the year in which taxable income is initially generated by the approved enterprise  provided that the earlier of years have not elapsed from the year in which the approval was granted  or years from the year in which the enterprise was initially operated 
more energy s initial approved enterprise plan was completed during and its status as an entity qualifying for tax benefits will be governed by the provisions of the investment law  as amended see below 
on april   an amendment to the investment law came into effect the amendment and has significantly changed the provisions of the investment law 
the amendment sets forth the scope of enterprises which may qualify as a privileged enterprise under the amendment  the designation is privileged enterprise rather than approved enterprise by setting forth criteria for qualification of a company  such as provisions generally requiring that at least of the privileged enterprise s income will be derived from export and that minimum qualifying investments in productive assets be made 
under the amendment  the year in which the company elects to commence its tax benefits is designated as the year of election year of election 
a company may choose its year of election by notifying the israeli tax authorities in connection with filings its annual tax return or within months after the end of the year of election  whichever is earlier  or by requesting an advanced ruling from the israeli tax authorities no later than within months after the end of the year of election 
the investment law  as amended  also provides that any certificate of approval granted prior to the amendment will remain subject to the terms and benefits included in such certificate of approval 
accordingly  while it is anticipated that the investment law  as amended  will govern more energy s privileged enterprise terms and benefits  we do not expect that the amendment will have any impact on medis el 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  stock options and warrants and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we consider accounting policies related to our goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical due to the estimation processes involved and their materiality to our financial statements 
as of december   the net book values of our goodwill and intangible assets were  and  respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets arose primarily as a result of three purchase accounting transactions our acquisition of the minority interest in medis inc in  our exchange of our shares for the minority interest in medis el in and our acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own in in amortizing our goodwill through december  and our intangible assets through december   we made estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of such assets 
if our estimates and assumptions change  the useful lives and resulting charges to operations for amortization of such assets would also change 
additionally  with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas no 
requires enterprises  effective january   to discontinue amortizing goodwill  and instead requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
as part of our initial evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for any possible impairment  as of january   we were required to use estimates and assumptions with respect to markets for our products  future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
we have also performed annual tests for impairment of our goodwill for each of the years from  through the estimates we used assume that our products will be accepted and that we will gain market share in the future and will experience growth in such market share 
if we fail to deliver products or to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margins  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if our estimates and or other assumptions change or other circumstances change with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies  we may  in the future  be required to record charges to operations for impairment of our goodwill and or our intangible assets 
stock options and warrants we also consider accounting policies related to stock options and warrants to be critical due to the estimation process involved 
we utilize stock options and warrants as an important means of compensation for employees  directors and consultants and also warrants as an instrument in our fundraising process 
accounting for such options and warrants  in some circumstances  results in significant non cash charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
there are assumptions and estimates involved in determining the value of such stock options and warrants and the timing of related charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected term of the option  volatility of our stock price and interest rates 
the market price of our stock also has a significant impact on charges we incur related to stock options and warrants 
if these estimates and assumptions change or if our stock price changes  the charges to operations and or accumulated loss could also change significantly 
effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  and related securities and exchange commission rules included in staff accounting bulletin no 
 on a modified prospective basis 
under this method  compensation cost recognized beginning january  include costs related to all share based payments stock options and restricted stock awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and all share based payments granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation cost for stock options is generally recognized ratably over the vesting period 
during the year ended december  we incurred significant non cash charges to operations on grants of stock options to employees and directors as a result of our adoption of sfas r on january  and we expect to continue to incur significant charges in the future 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
in the event that we were to determine that we are likely to be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
this statement amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
this statement allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
it also clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas  establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interest that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and  amends sfas to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
this statement shall be effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after september  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 
fin creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin clearly scopes out income taxes from financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions
