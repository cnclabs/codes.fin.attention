industry trends  challenges  risks and growth opportunities according to a january report by deutsche bank  in  overall worldwide wireless handset sales increased by approximately  and are forecasted to increase in and in a rapid decline in wireless handset sales growth could negatively impact our net sales 
excess supply conditions can reduce the market prices of the products we sell and therefore affect our ability to generate net sales and gross profit at historical levels and could affect the value of our inventory 
conversely  should manufacturers be unable to respond to an unanticipated increase in demand on a timely basis  we  along with others in our industry  could experience supply constraints that would affect our ability to deliver products 
we are unable to quantify these effects  as it is difficult to predict future supply conditions and demand patterns which affect our ability to meet customer demand or sell handsets at an acceptable gross profit 
company specific trends  challenges risks and growth opportunities in  our net sales increased by  and handset units sold increased by 
although we have incorporated growth into our strategy  there can be no assurances that these trends will continue and we cannot anticipate future growth to be at the same levels 
our strategy incorporates overall growth elements for each aspect of our business  which we hope will result in continued earnings growth  however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
year ended december  amounts in s net sales increase over prior year results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  our net sales increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  such increase was primarily attributable to a increase in wireless handset volume  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price per unit sold

for the year ended december   our gross margin percentage decreased to from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the change of product and regional mix of our sales  including higher sales in central america  as different products and different regions have varying margins 
we believe that the addition of the semi proprietary and our proprietary products in will have a positive effect on our gross margins  the extent of which will depend on the relative mix of products and overall net sales

the consistency in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is a primary result of increased revenues together with management s efforts to utilize efficiencies  as we have structured our operating expenses to fluctuate with the varying levels of sales volume on a quarterly basis

in january  we raised million gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock and related warrants for our common stock 
we believe that our existing cash resources  together with our projected cash flow from operations and the net proceeds from our bank line of credit  will be sufficient to allow us to implement our strategy and growth plan 
credit facility we have a fully collateralized line of credit with wells fargo hsbc trade bank na wells fargo that allows us to borrow up to a maximum of million 
this line of credit has a maturity date of october  under this line of credit  our advances cannot exceed of eligible domestic accounts receivable or of eligible foreign insured accounts receivable

we borrowed million during the year ended december  and repaid million during the same period 
cash used in continuing operations was million for the year ended december  the use of cash from operations was primarily due to our increased levels of accounts receivable million which was partially offset by the increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses million

revenue recognition and accrued chargebacks the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for distribution revenue  which is recorded using the gross method  the criteria of sab are generally met upon shipment to customers  including title transfer  and therefore  revenue is recognized at the time of shipment 
in some circumstances  the customer may take legal title and assume risk of loss upon delivery  and therefore  revenue is recognized on the delivery date 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative arrangements marketing  training and promotional funds  returns  and allowances 
consideration is given on select sales for cooperative arrangements related to market development  training and special promotions usually agreed upon in advance 
the amount given is generally in the form of a credit memo  which is applied as a reduction of the sale 
the same amount is recorded as a current liability 
expenditures made pursuant to the agreed upon activity reduce this liability 
to the extent that the company incurs costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  the company recognizes the amount as a selling or marketing expense 
the company does not have any material post shipment obligations eg customer acceptance or other arrangements 
a portion of the company s sales involves shipments of products directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in such circumstances  the company negotiates the price with the supplier and the customer  assumes responsibility for the delivery of the product and  at times  takes the ownership risk while the product is in transit  pays the supplier directly for the product shipped  establishes payment terms and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers 
in addition  the company bears responsibility for accepting returns of products from the customer in these arrangements 
under these arrangements  the company serves as the principal with the customer  as defined by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and therefore recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has shipped or in cases of fob destination  cip destination  or similar terms  the company recognizes the sales upon confirmation of delivery to the customer at the named destination 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment on a net or day basis depending on customer 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging and provide reserves for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
customer credit worthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and sales returns  and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally nine months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally provide a full reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant forecast for the applicable period 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding nine months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for the future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide a reserve  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
contractual obligations we lease corporate and administrative office facilities  and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
certain of these leases contain renewal options 
rent expense under these leases was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also have a revolving line of credit facility  which is shown on our balance sheet as a current liability and the balance was million and million at december  and respectively 
the following is a schedule of aggregate future minimum rental payments required by the above leases 
in addition  our future minimum lease requirements include obligations for the retail lease locations we have assigned to a third party  because we remain financially liable should the assignee default on the assigned leases 
there are approximately two months of lease payments in escrow that are held by a third party in the event of assignee default 
we believe these lease locations are desirable and anticipate that  if necessary  we would be able to find a suitable tenant for these locations within two months after any default by the assignee 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years revolving line of credit operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total this amount was paid back in january  and the outstanding balance varies daily includes buildings  equipment and retail kiosks from discontinued operations recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the fair value approach in sfas r is similar to the fair value approach described in sfas r 
in  the company used the black scholes formula to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
the company adopted sfas r  using the modified prospective method  beginning january  based on the terms of our stock option plans  there was no cumulative effect upon adoption 
the company elected to continue to estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes formula 
in the year ended december   the adoption of sfas r included an operating expense of  further  we believe the adoption of sfas r could have a material impact on our company s future stock based compensation expense 
as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under our plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over the next three years 
this expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock based compensation awards 
in february the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas amends sfas to narrow the scope exception for interest only and principal only strips on debt instruments to include only such strips representing rights to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest or principal cash flows 
sfas also amends sfas to allow qualifying special purpose entities to hold a passive derivative financial instrument pertaining to beneficial interests that itself is a derivative financial instrument 
generally  fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that a derivative embedded in a host contract that does not meet the definition of a derivative be accounted for separately referred to as bifurcation under certain conditions 
that general rule notwithstanding  sfas no 
prior to amendments made to it by sfas no 
provides a broad exception for interest only and principal only strips initially resulting from the separation of rights to receive contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that itself does not contain an embedded derivative that would have been accounted for separately 
sfas amends sfas to restrict the scope exception to strips that represent rights to receive only a portion of the contractual interest cash flows or of the contractual principal cash flows of a specific debt instrument 
prior to amendments made by sfas  sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  permitted a qualifying special purpose entity spe to hold only passive derivative financial instruments pertaining to beneficial interests other than another derivative financial instrument issued or sold to parties other than the transferor 
sfas amends sfas to allow a qualifying spe to hold a derivative instrument pertaining to beneficial interests that itself is a derivative financial instrument 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas no 
 which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations  requires that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits an entity to choose either the amortization method or the fair value method for subsequent measurement for each class of separately recognized servicing assets or servicing liabilities  permits at initial adoption a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized servicing rights  provided the securities reclassified offset the entity s exposure to changes in the fair value of the servicing assets or liabilities  and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
the statement also describes the manner in which it should be initially applied 
the company does not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines the fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is encouraged  provided that the registrant has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  which improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the over or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not for profit organization 
this statement also improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
this statement amends statement  fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  statement  and fasb statement no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
upon the initial application of this statement and subsequently  and employer should continue to apply the provisions in statements    and in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its statement of financial position and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost 
an employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  an employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after june  early application of the recognition or measurement date provisions is encouraged  however  early application must be for all of an employer s benefit plans 
retrospective application of the statement is not permitted 
in september  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
this sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheets and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the sab no 
permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
we are currently evaluating the impact sab no 
may have to our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position  that based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding revolving line of credit 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate for the revolving line of credit is the prime rate minus at december  or libor plus at december  
for every increase in our bank s prime rate or libor  our interest expense would increase by  assuming the same million remained outstanding for the entire year 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that we would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
market risk a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets outside the united states  however all sales transactions and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for both our domestic and foreign sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our financial results during  or
