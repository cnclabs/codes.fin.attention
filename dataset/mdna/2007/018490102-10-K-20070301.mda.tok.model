item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  the accounting policies  estimates and assumptions described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of specialty pharmaceutical products primarily eye care pharmaceuticals and skin care products to wholesalers within the united states  and we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
a portion of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at physician  hospital and clinic locations 
these customers are contractually obligated to maintain a specific level of inventory and to notify us upon the use of consigned inventory 
revenue for consigned inventory is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been used 
notification is usually through the replenishing of the inventory  and we periodically review consignment inventories to confirm the accuracy of customer reporting 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from most product lines by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from normal distribution channels 
return policies in certain international markets and for certain medical device products  primarily breast implants  provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
we do not provide a right of return on our facial aesthetics product line 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
the amount of allowances for sales returns recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for sales returns at december  compared to december  and the increase in the provision for sales returns in compared to and was primarily due to the acquired inamed medical device products  primarily breast implants  which generally have a significantly higher rate of return than specialty pharmaceutical products 
historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been within the amounts reserved or accrued 
we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid and medicare 
sales rebate and other incentive programs also include chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits managers and group purchasing organizations 
sales rebates and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for sales rebates and other incentive programs during and compared to the corresponding prior year is primarily due to the increase in us specialty pharmaceutical sales  principally eye care pharmaceutical products which are subject to such rebate and incentive programs 
in addition  an increase in our published list prices in the united states for pharmaceutical products  which occurred for several of our products early in and  generally results in higher provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales 
our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors  including but not limited to  current market dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  and actual movements of the us consumer price index urban cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated product net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated product net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 
we recognize license fees  royalties and reimbursement income for services provided as other revenues based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a contractual agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after entering into the contract 
we defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not culminated 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the united states and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our us pension plans account for a large majority of our aggregate pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our us pension plans for determining the net periodic benefit cost is for  which is the same rate used for and our assumptions for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our non us pension plans were  and for  and  respectively 
we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plans investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in our rate of return on assets assumptions for our us and us pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and non us pension benefit obligations at december  were and  respectively  and at december  were and  respectively 
we determine the discount rate largely based upon an index of high quality fixed income investments for our us plans  we use the us moody s aa corporate long bond index and for our non us plans  we use the iboxx corporate aa year index and the iboxx corporate aa year index and  for our us plans  a constructed hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with maturities that mirror the pension benefit obligations at the plans measurement date 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption for our u 
s and non us pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the balance sheet recognition and reporting provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which required us to recognize the funded status  which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations  of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
we discuss this change in accounting principle and the impact on our consolidated financial statements under item a of part ii of this report  recently adopted accounting standards 
share based awards on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of share based payment awards is estimated at the grant date using an option pricing model  and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation cost was recognized for awards to employees or directors if the exercise price of the award was equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not retrospectively revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and awards that were outstanding on the adoption effective date that are subsequently modified or cancelled 
estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding and unvested on the adoption effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
pre tax share based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of compensation related to employee and director stock options of million  employee and director restricted share awards of million  and million related to stock contributed to employee benefit plans 
pre tax share based compensation expense recognized under apb no 
for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of compensation related to employee and director restricted share awards of million and million related to stock contributed to employee benefit plans 
pre tax share based compensation expense recognized under apb no 
for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of compensation related to employee and director restricted share awards of million and million related to stock contributed to employee benefit plans 
there was no share based compensation expense recognized during and related to employee or director stock options 
the income tax benefit related to recognized share based compensation was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we used an estimated stock price volatility based upon our five year historical average 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed our estimated volatility calculation to an equal weighting of our ten year historical average and the average implied volatility of at the money options traded in the open market 
we estimate employee stock option exercise behavior based on actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
we recognize share based compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 
since share based compensation under sfas no 
r is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
sfas no 
r requires these estimates to be revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
in the pro forma information required under sfas no 
prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transitional election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to tax effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions and research and development r d tax credits available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for uncertain tax positions  utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities  along with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
changes in the valuation allowances are recognized in the provision for income taxes as incurred and are generally included as a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
the decrease in the amount of valuation allowances at december  compared to december  is primarily due to a million reversal of the valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset that we have determined is now realizable 
as a result of this determination  we have filed a refund claim for a prior year with the us internal revenue service 
this refund claim relates to the deductibility of certain capitalized intangible assets associated with our retinoid portfolio that we transferred to a third party in the balance of the net decrease in the valuation allowance at december  compared to december  is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain capitalized intangible assets that became realizable due to the completion of a federal tax audit in the united states  and the abandonment of certain intangible assets for tazarotene oral technologies that will result in a current tax deduction 
material differences in the estimated amount of valuation allowances may result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes if the actual amounts for valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets differ from the amounts we estimate 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings indefinitely in these foreign operations 
at december   we had approximately million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
income tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
we annually update our estimate of unremitted earnings outside the united states after the completion of each fiscal year 
purchase price allocation the allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
on march   we acquired inamed corporation  or inamed  and we engaged an independent third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the estimated fair values of in process research and development  identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets 
appraisals inherently require significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process r d projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the inamed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period under sfas no 
 which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 
operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a technology driven  global health care company that discovers  develops and commercializes specialty pharmaceutical and medical device products for the ophthalmic  neurological  facial aesthetics  medical dermatological  breast aesthetics  obesity intervention and other specialty markets 
we are a pioneer in specialty pharmaceutical research  targeting products and technologies related to specific disease areas such as glaucoma  retinal disease  dry eye  psoriasis  acne and movement disorders 
additionally  we discover  develop and market medical devices  aesthetics related pharmaceuticals  and over the counter products 
within these areas  we are an innovative leader in saline and silicone gel filled breast implants  dermal facial fillers and obesity intervention products  therapeutic and other prescription products  and to a limited degree  over the counter products that are sold in more than countries around the world 
we are also focusing research and development efforts on new therapeutic areas  including gastroenterology  neuropathic pain and genitourinary diseases 
at december   we employed approximately  persons around the world 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of operations following our june spin off of amo and through the first fiscal quarter of  we operated our business on the basis of a single reportable segment specialty pharmaceuticals 
due to the inamed acquisition  beginning in the second fiscal quarter of  we operated our business on the basis of two reportable segments specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
the specialty pharmaceuticals segment produces a broad range of pharmaceutical products  including ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy  ocular inflammation  infection  allergy and dry eye  skin care products for acne  psoriasis and other prescription and over the counter dermatological products  and botox for certain therapeutic and aesthetic indications 
the medical devices segment produces breast implants for aesthetic augmentation and reconstructive surgery  facial aesthetics products  and the lap band system designed to treat severe and morbid obesity and the bib tm system for the treatment of obesity 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to coordinate the development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
management evaluates our business segments and various global product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported sales  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported sales 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates 
the following tables compare net sales by product line within each reportable segment and certain selected pharmaceutical products for the years ended december   and year ended change in percent change in december  product net sales product net sales total performance currency total performance currency in millions net sales by product line specialty pharmaceuticals eye care pharmaceuticals botox neuromodulator skin care subtotal pharmaceuticals other total specialty pharmaceuticals medical devices breast aesthetics obesity intervention facial aesthetics total medical devices total product net sales domestic product net sales international product net sales selected product sales alphagan p  alphagan and combigan lumigan franchise other glaucoma restasis year ended change in percent change in december  product net sales product net sales total performance currency total performance currency in millions net sales by product line specialty pharmaceuticals eye care pharmaceuticals botox neuromodulator skin care subtotal pharmaceuticals other total specialty pharmaceuticals domestic product net sales international product net sales selected product sales alphagan p  alphagan and combigan lumigan franchise other glaucoma restasis other specialty pharmaceuticals sales primarily consist of sales to advanced medical optics  inc  or amo  pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement entered into as part of the june amo spin off that terminated as scheduled in june product net sales the million increase in product net sales in compared to primarily resulted from million of medical device product net sales in following the inamed acquisition and an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due primarily to increases in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals and botox product lines  partially offset by a decrease in other specialty pharmaceuticals sales  primarily consisting of contract sales to amo that terminated as scheduled in june eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales of restasis  our therapeutic for the treatment of chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  an increase in sales of elestat  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  an increase in sales of combigan tm in europe  latin america and canada  an increase in new product sales of alphagan p  our recently introduced next generation of alphagan for the treatment of glaucoma that was launched in the united states in the first quarter of  strong sales growth of zymar  a newer anti infective  and an increase in sales of acular ls  our newer non steriodal anti inflammatory 
this increase in eye care pharmaceuticals sales was partially offset by lower sales of alphagan p due to a general decline in us wholesaler demand and the negative effect of generic alphagan competition  a decrease in sales of acular  our older generation anti inflammatory  and lower sales of other glaucoma products 
we continue to believe that generic formulations of alphagan will have a negative effect on future net sales of our alphagan franchise 
we estimate the majority of the increase in our eye care pharmaceuticals sales was due to a shift in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher priced products  and an overall net increase in the volume of product sold 
we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from five percent to nine percent  effective january  we increased the published us list price for lumigan by five percent  restasis by seven percent  alphagan p by five percent  zymar by seven percent  and acular ls by nine percent 
this increase in prices had a positive net effect on our us sales for  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our specialty pharmaceutical products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our specialty pharmaceutical products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong growth in demand in the united states and in international markets  excluding japan  for both cosmetic and therapeutic use 
effective january   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately four percent  which we believe had a positive effect on our us sales growth in  primarily related to sales of botox cosmetic 
in the united states  the actual net effect from the increase in price for sales of botox for therapeutic use is difficult to determine  primarily due to rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies 
international botox sales benefited from strong sales growth for both cosmetic and therapeutic use in europe  latin america and asia pacific outside japan 
this increase in international botox sales was partially offset by a million decrease in international sales of botox for therapeutic use in japan  where we recently adopted a third party license and distribution business model as a result of our long term agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  that commenced in september based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales 
therapeutic and cosmetic net sales increased by approximately and  respectively in compared to the growth rate in botox therapeutic net sales was negatively impacted in by the million reduction in net sales in japan in compared to due to our long term agreement with gsk 
excluding this net sales reduction of million in japan  therapeutic botox net sales increased by in compared to we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  is currently over 
skin care sales increased in compared to primarily due to higher sales of tazorac  zorac  avage and md forte 
net sales of tazorac  zorac and avage increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in sales of tazorac  zorac and avage resulted primarily from our increasing the published us list price for these products by nine percent effective january  net sales from medical device products were million in product net sales consisted of million related to breast aesthetics  million for obesity intervention and million for facial aesthetics 
medical device product net sales have been included in our consolidated product net sales effective march   the date of the inamed acquisition 
breast aesthetics net sales primarily consist of saline filled and silicone gel filled breast implants and tissue expanders for use in breast reconstruction  augmentation and revisions 
obesity intervention net sales primarily consist of devices used for minimally invasive long term treatments of obesity such as our lap band system and bib tm system 
facial aesthetics net sales primarily consist of dermal filler products used to correct facial wrinkles  which include collagen and hyaluronic acid based injectable products 
the million increase in net sales in compared to was primarily the result of increases in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox and skin care product lines  partially offset by a decrease in other non pharmaceutical sales to amo 
eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales in the united states of restasis  our drug for the treatment of chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  growth in sales of our alphagan franchise  primarily from our international operations and new product sales from combigan tm which was in the launch phase in canada and brazil during  a strong increase in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  growth in sales of zymar  a newer anti infective  an increase in sales of elestat  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  and an increase in sales of acular ls  our newer non steroidal anti inflammatory 
this increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in sales of ocuflox  our older generation anti infective that is experiencing generic competition in the united states  acular  our older generation anti inflammatory  and other glaucoma products 
we continue to believe that generic formulations of alphagan will have a negative impact on future net sales of our alphagan franchise 
we estimate the majority of the change in our eye care pharmaceutical sales was due to mix and volume changes  however  we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from three and one half percent to nine percent  effective february  we increased the published us list price for lumigan by seven percent  restasis by three and one half percent and alphagan p by five percent 
this increase in prices had a subsequent positive net effect on our us sales during compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily as a result of strong growth in demand in the united states and in international markets for both therapeutic and cosmetic uses 
based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate that in  botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales 
therapeutic and cosmetic net sales grew approximately and  respectively  in compared to effective january   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately four percent  which we believe had a positive effect on our us sales growth in international botox sales also benefited from strong sales growth in europe  especially in germany  the united kingdom  spain  italy and the nordics  growth in sales in smaller distribution markets serviced by our european export sales group  and an increase in sales in canada  mexico  japan and australia 
we believe our worldwide market share in for neuromodulators  including botox  was over skin care sales increased in compared to primarily due to higher sales of tazorac in the united states and new product sales generated from prevage tm antioxidant cream  which we launched in january net sales of tazorac  zorac and avage increased million  or  to million in compared to million in we increased the published us list price for tazorac by nine percent effective february  foreign currency changes increased product net sales by million in compared to  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and brazilian real  partially offset by the weakening of the australian dollar and other asian and latin america currencies compared to the us dollar 
the million increase in net sales from the impact of foreign currency changes in compared to was due primarily to the strengthening of the brazilian real  canadian dollar  british pound  australian dollar  mexican peso  the euro and other latin american currencies compared to the us dollar 
us sales as a percentage of total product net sales decreased by percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to the impact of sales of medical device products  which have a lower amount of us sales as a percentage of total product net sales compared to our pharmaceutical products  and a decrease in us other non pharmaceutical sales  partially offset by an increase in us botox sales as a percentage of total pharmaceutical product net sales 
us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales declined percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to a decrease in us other non pharmaceutical sales and an increase in international botox and eye care pharmaceutical sales  principally in europe  as a percentage of total product net sales 
other revenues other revenues increased million to million in compared to million in other revenues increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in other revenues in compared to is primarily related to an increase of approximately million in royalty income earned principally from sales of botox in japan by gsk under a license agreement and other miscellaneous royalty agreements  and an increase of approximately million in reimbursement income  earned primarily from services provided in connection with contractual agreements related to the development and promotion of botox in japan and china  the co promotion of gsk s products imitrex statdose system and amerge in the united states to neurologists  and services performed under a co promotion agreement for a third party skin care product 
the increase in other revenues in compared to is primarily related to an increase in reimbursement income of million associated with services provided in connection with contractual agreements related to the development of posurdex for the ophthalmic specialty market in japan  the development and promotion of botox in japan and china  and services performed under a co promotion agreement for a third party skin care product  partially offset by a decline in royalty income of million  due primarily to a decrease in royalty receipts related to patents for the use of botulinum toxin type b for cervical dystonia

our cost of sales as a percentage of product net sales for increased percentage points from our cost of sales percentage in  primarily as a result of incremental cost of sales of million associated with the inamed acquisition purchase accounting fair market value inventory adjustment that was fully recognized as cost of sales in  sales of our medical device products  which generally have a higher cost of sales percentage compared to our specialty pharmaceutical products and a small increase in our cost of sales percentage for botox 
cost of sales in also includes million related to integration and transition costs associated with the inamed acquisition and million of costs associated with stock option compensation 
the increase in the cost of sales percentage in compared to was partially offset by the million decrease in other non pharmaceutical sales  primarily contract manufacturing sales related to amo  which had a significantly higher cost of sales percentage than our pharmaceutical sales

on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable march  to stockholders of record on february  we maintain an evergreen stock repurchase program 
our evergreen stock repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock for the primary purpose of funding our stock based benefit plans 
under the stock repurchase program  we may maintain up to million repurchased shares in our treasury account at any one time 
as of december   we held approximately million treasury shares under this program 
we are uncertain as to the level of stock repurchases  if any  to be made in the future 
the convertible notes pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum and are convertible  at the holder s option  at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
in certain circumstances the convertible notes may be convertible into cash in an amount equal to the lesser of their principal amount or their conversion value 
if the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount at the time of conversion  we will also deliver common stock or  at our election  a combination of cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
we will not be permitted to redeem the convertible notes prior to april   will be permitted to redeem the convertible notes from and after april  to april  if the closing price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold  and will be permitted to redeem the convertible notes at any time on or after april  holders of the convertible notes will also be able to require us to redeem the convertible notes on april   april  and april  or upon a change in control of us

at december   we had a committed long term credit facility  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  an unused debt shelf registration statement that we may use for a new medium term note program and other issuances of debt securities  and various foreign bank facilities 
the committed long term credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million through march the commercial paper program also provides for up to million in borrowings 
the current medium term note program allows us to issue up to an additional million in registered notes on a non revolving basis 
the debt shelf registration statement provides for up to million in additional debt securities 
borrowings under the committed long term credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maintaining maximum leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios 
certain covenants also limit subsidiary debt 
we believe we were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   we had million in borrowings under our committed long term credit facility  million in borrowings outstanding under the medium term note program and no borrowings under our commercial paper program 
during march and april  holders of our notes began to exercise the conversion feature of the notes 
in may  we announced our intention to redeem the notes 
most holders elected to exercise the conversion feature of the notes prior to redemption 
upon their conversion  we were required to pay the accreted value of the notes in cash and had the option to pay the remainder of the conversion value in cash or shares of our common stock 
we exercised our option to pay the remainder of the conversion value in shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we paid approximately million in cash for the accreted value of the notes and issued million shares of our common stock for the remainder of the conversion value 
in addition  holders of approximately million of aggregate principal at maturity of the notes did not exercise the conversion feature  and in may we paid the accreted value approximately million in cash to redeem these notes 
a significant amount of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
withholding and us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested these earnings indefinitely in such operations 
as of december   we had approximately million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
in connection with our march inamed acquisition  we initiated a global restructuring and integration plan to merge the inamed operations with our operations and to capture synergies through the centralization of certain general and administrative functions 
as of december   we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  million of integration and transition costs and million of income tax costs related to intercompany transfers of trade businesses and net assets  which we included in our provision for income taxes 
we currently estimate that the total pre tax charges resulting from the restructuring  including integration and transition costs  will be between million and million  all of which are expected to be cash expenditures 
in addition to the pre tax charges  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million  primarily related to the integration of information systems  and to pay an additional amount of approximately million to million for taxes related to intercompany transfers of trade businesses and net assets 
during  we completed the restructuring and streamlining of our operations in japan 
as of december   we recorded cumulative pre tax restructuring charges of million million in and a net reversal of million in 
there are no remaining accrued liabilities for restructuring and streamlining of our operations in japan at december  as of december   we substantially completed the restructuring and streamlining of our european operations and recorded cumulative pre tax restructuring charges of million  primarily related to severance  relocation and one time termination benefits  payments to public employment and training programs  contract termination costs and capital and other asset related expenses 
additionally  as of december   we incurred cumulative transition and duplicate operating expenses of million relating primarily to legal  consulting  recruiting  information system implementation costs and taxes related to the european restructuring activities 
future expenses related to the restructuring and streamlining of our european operations  if any  are not expected to be significant 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 
 which required us to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the year ended december  we discuss the change in accounting principle and the impact on our financial statements under item a of part ii of this report  recently adopted accounting standards 
on january   we consummated the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of groupe corn al laboratoires and its subsidiaries  or corn al  pursuant to a stock sale and purchase agreement  or purchase agreement  dated october   by and among us  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary allergan holdings france  sas  and waldemar kita  the controlling stockholder of corn al  the european pre floatation fund ii and the other minority stockholders of corn al 
under the purchase agreement  we purchased the outstanding capital stock of corn al for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  subject to possible post closing adjustments based on a final determination of corn al s debt and cash levels 
the acquisition consideration was all cash  funded from current cash and equivalents balances and our committed long term credit facility 
on february   we completed the acquisition of endoart sa 
under the terms of the agreement  we purchased all the outstanding capital stock of endoart sa for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of excess cash 
the acquisition consideration was all cash  funded from current cash and equivalents balances 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our expected obligations  working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our product net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as we deem appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was as follows a million increase in  a million increase in  and a million increase in the sales increase included million related to the brazilian real  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the euro  and million related to the british pound  partially offset by decreases of million primarily related to the australian dollar and other asian and latin american currencies 
the sales increase included million related to the euro  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the australian dollar  million related to the brazilian real  million related to the mexican peso and million related to other latin american currencies

inamed corporation on march   we completed the acquisition of inamed corporation  or inamed  a global healthcare company that develops  manufactures  and markets a diverse line of products  including breast implants  a range of facial aesthetics  and obesity intervention products 
the inamed acquisition was completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of december   and subsequently amended as of march   by and among us  our wholly owned subsidiary banner acquisition  inc  and inamed  and an exchange offer made by banner acquisition to acquire inamed shares for either in cash or of a share of our common stock  subject to proration so that of the aggregate inamed shares tendered were exchanged for cash and of the aggregate inamed shares tendered were exchanged for shares of our common stock 
in the exchange offer  we paid approximately billion in cash and issued  shares of common stock through banner acquisition  acquiring approximately of inamed s outstanding common stock 
following the exchange offer  the remaining outstanding shares of inamed common stock were acquired for approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock through the merger of banner acquisition with and into inamed in a merger in which inamed survived as our wholly owned subsidiary 
as a final step in the plan of reorganization  we merged inamed into inamed  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
the consideration paid in the merger does not include shares of common stock and cash that were paid to option holders for outstanding options to purchase shares of inamed common stock  which were cancelled in the merger and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to of the in the money value of the option and a number of shares of our common stock with a value equal to of the in the money value of the option 
subsequent to the merger  we issued  shares of common stock and paid million in cash to satisfy this obligation to the option holders 
we funded part of the cash portion of the purchase price by borrowing million under our billion bridge credit facility 
in april  we used the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay borrowings under the bridge credit facility 
also  we subsequently terminated the bridge credit facility in april see note  inamed acquisition  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on reasonable assumptions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules  for activities relating to foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
we record current changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts as unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  net  and we record the gains and losses realized from settled option contracts in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and are amortized to other  net over the life of the options 
we have recorded all unrealized and realized gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
if the interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt at december  in february  we entered into interest rate swap contracts based on the month libor with an aggregate notional amount of million  a swap period of years and a starting swap rate of 
we entered into these swap contracts as a cash flow hedge to effectively fix the future interest rate for our million aggregate principal amount senior notes due issued in april in april  we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received approximately million 
the total gain is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over a year period to match the term of the notes 
as of december   the remaining unrecognized gain  net of tax  of million is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   there are no outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
on january   we entered into a nine year  two month interest rate swap with a million notional amount with semi annual settlements and quarterly interest rate reset dates 
the swap receives interest at a fixed rate of and pays interest at a variable interest rate equal to libor plus  and effectively converts million of the notes to a variable interest rate 
based on the structure of the hedging relationship  the hedge meets the criteria for using the short cut method for a fair value hedge under the provisions of sfas no

we have also entered into contractual indemnity agreements with each of our directors and executive officers  pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify such directors and executive officers against any payments they are required to make as a result of a claim brought against such executive officer or director in such capacity  excluding claims i relating to the action or inaction of a director or executive officer that resulted in such director or executive officer gaining personal profit or advantage  ii for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale of our securities within the meaning of section b of the securities exchange act of or similar provisions of any state law or iii that are based upon or arise out of such director s or executive officer s knowingly fraudulent  deliberately dishonest or willful misconduct 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
however  we have purchased directors and officers liability insurance policies intended to reduce our monetary exposure and to enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we have not previously paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims as a result of these indemnification provisions 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal 
we customarily agree in the ordinary course of our business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials investigators in our drug development programs  in sponsored research agreements with academic and not for profit institutions  in various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for us in the ordinary course of business  and in our real estate leases 
we also customarily agree to certain indemnification provisions in our drug discovery and development collaboration agreements 
with respect to our clinical trials and sponsored research agreements  these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the investigator s institution relating to personal injury or property damage  violations of law or certain breaches of our contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical testing of our compounds or drug candidates 
with respect to real estate lease agreements  the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury or property damage caused by us  to violations of law by us or to certain breaches of our contractual obligations 
the indemnification provisions appearing in our collaboration agreements are similar  but in addition provide some limited indemnification for the collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
in each of the above cases  the term of these indemnification provisions generally survives the termination of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited 
we have purchased insurance policies covering personal injury  property damage and general liability intended to reduce our exposure for indemnification and to enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we have not previously paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims as a result of these indemnification provisions 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal 
foreign currency risk overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated revenues or operating costs and expenses as expressed in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management to focus its attention on our core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying currency exposures 
all of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to protect the value of intercompany receivables denominated in currencies other than the lender s functional currency
