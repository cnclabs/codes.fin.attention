critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue substantially all of the services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly or quarterly that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  property  plant equipment plant and equipment including dosimetry badges and software are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings and three to eight years for equipment 
landauer assesses the carrying value of its property  plant and equipment and the remaining useful lives whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
landauer capitalizes  as a component of equipment  internal software costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
such costs amounted to   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and in fiscal year   of the software costs was related to the implementation of an information technology initiative to re engineer various business processes and replace components of its information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle 
the new software is replacing certain legacy assets that were either subject to immediate impairment or retirement once the full system implementation has been completed 
in fiscal year  the remainder of the costs was related to legacy assets  some of which were included in the evaluation for immediate impairment or retirement 
information regarding these costs is contained under the footnote impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on page of this annual report on form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets landauer s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents and goodwill  an asset with an indefinite life 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe and sapra landauer as well as other smaller investments 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed periodically for impairment 
under sfas no 
 the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized  generally  must be performed annually and based on fair values 
the company s methodology for testing goodwill for impairment includes a review of potential impairment triggering events  financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by investment  and tests of fair market value

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states  landauer maintains a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and a supplemental key executive retirement plan that provides for certain retirement benefits payable to key officers and managers 
while charges for the supplemental plan are expensed annually  the plan is not separately funded 
the company maintains a directors retirement plan  terminated in  that provides for certain retirement benefits payable to non employee directors 
additionally  the company maintains an unfunded retiree medical expense reimbursement plan 
the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for these plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
management reviews the plan assumptions on an annual basis to ensure that the most current  relevant information is considered 
if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
the weighted average assumed discount rate used to determine the fiscal plan expenses was compared to for fiscal for fiscal expense  the expected long term rate of return of plan assets was compared to the fiscal rate of 
in establishing the rate  management considered the historical rates of return and the current and planned asset classes of the plan investment portfolio 
in determining the rate of compensation increase of for fiscal and  management considered historical company increases  market expectations and expected future company increases 
the weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at september  were a discount rate of compared to the fiscal rate of  adjusted to reflect the single rate that  when applied to the projected benefit disbursements from the plan  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that make up the citigroup pension discount curve as of september   and a rate of compensation increase of  unchanged from fiscal effective september   the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
the statement requires the recognition of a plan s funded status on the company s balance sheet 
previously unrecognized transactions and events affecting the plan s funded status are recognized as components of the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
these components will continue to be modified as a result of future transactions and events  amortization of previously unrecognized costs  and changes to actuarial assumptions 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management s control could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the financial statements of the company s international subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the us dollar as the functional currency 
to date  the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these risks could increase  however  as the company expands in international markets 
the company does not have any significant trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  or commitments in a currency other than that of the reporting unit s functional currency 
the company estimates that a adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased reported net income by approximately  in fiscal the company does not believe that such an adverse change would have a material impact to its financial condition 
therefore  the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in its non us operations or for trading or speculative purposes
