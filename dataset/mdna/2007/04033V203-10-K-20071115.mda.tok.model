recent event on september   we announced that we had signed an agreement to acquire procuri  a privately held company headquartered in atlanta  georgia 
procuri is a provider of on demand supply management solutions 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay million in consideration at closing  consisting of equal amounts of cash and stock  of which million of the cash will be placed in escrow to secure indemnity obligations of procuri stockholders 
we will also assume and payoff approximately million of procuri s debt 
the transaction is expected to close in the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal year prior period adjustment in connection with a review of our deferred revenue accounts in the year ended september   a million adjustment was made to increase the september  deferred revenue  current and decrease deferred revenue  less current portion 
the adjustment of deferred revenues corrected an error in the classification between deferred revenue  current and deferred revenues  less current portion 
total deferred revenues were not impacted by the adjustment

we have aligned our business model with the way we believe customers want to purchase and deploy spend management solutions 
customers may generally subscribe to our software products and services for a specified term  purchase a perpetual software license and or pay for services on a time and materials basis  depending upon their business requirements 
our revenue is comprised of license fees  subscription and maintenance fees  and services and other fees 
license revenue mainly consists of fees charged for the use of our software products under perpetual agreements 
subscription and maintenance revenue consists of fees charged for hosted on demand software solutions and fees for product updates and support  as well as fees paid by suppliers for access to the ariba supplier network 
services and other revenue consists of fees for implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous items  which are more fully described in business ariba spend management expertise 
due to the different treatment of our revenue streams under applicable accounting guidance  each type of revenue has a different impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subscription fees for hosted on demand software solutions are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the term 
therefore  a subscription license will result in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized perpetual license  but with revenue recognized in future periods 
similarly  maintenance fees are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
maintenance contracts are typically entered into when new software licenses are purchased  at a percentage of the software license fee 
in addition  most of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually to continue receiving product updates and product support 
given the ratable revenue recognition and historically high renewal rates of our subscription and maintenance agreements  this revenue stream has generally been more stable over time than perpetual software license fees 
services revenues are driven by a contract  project or statement of work  in which the fees may be fixed for specific services to be provided over time or billed on a time and materials basis 
the majority of our license fees are from perpetual software license sales 
revenue from these license sales is often recognized in the quarter that the software is delivered 
individual software license sales can be significant greater than million and sales cycles are often lengthy and difficult to predict 
as such  the timing of a few large software license transactions or the recognition of license revenue from these transactions can substantially affect our quarterly operating results 
these different revenue streams also carry different gross margins 
revenue from license fees tends to be high margin revenue  and gross margins are often greater than 
revenue from subscription and maintenance fees tends to be higher margin revenue with gross margins typically around to 
subscription and maintenance fees are generally based on software products developed by us  which carry minimal marginal cost to reproduce and sell 
revenue from labor intensive services and other fees tends to be lower margin revenue  with gross margins typically in the to range 
our overall gross margins could fluctuate from period to period depending upon the mix of revenue 
for example  a period with a higher mix of license revenue versus services revenue would drive overall gross margin higher and vice versa 
overview of fiscal year our software sales have shifted over time from predominantly perpetual licenses  with upfront revenue recognition  to more subscription or term licenses  with revenue recognition spread out over time 
this trend contributed to our subscription revenues increasing and our license revenue declining in the year ended september  our backlog of subscription software contracts increased during the year  which we anticipate will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year and beyond 

table of contents more specifically  license revenues of million in the year ended september  were down compared to the year ended september   while subscription and maintenance revenues of million were up compared to the year ended september  these changes were primarily due to a shift from perpetual software licenses to more subscription sales  as well as growth in overall software sales 
finally  services and other revenues of million were down compared to the year ended september  as a result of these trends  we experienced a continued shift in our revenue mix  with license revenues contributing of total revenues in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september   subscription and maintenance revenues contributing of total revenues in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september   and services and other revenues contributing of total revenues in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september   primarily as a result of the improvement in gross margin from services and other revenues from in the year ended september  to in the year ended september  and due to the shift in our revenue mix as the gross margin of software subscription and maintenance revenues is typically much higher than the gross margin of services revenues 
operating expenses decreased to million in the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september  the decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in net restructuring costs of million from the million charge in the year ended september  to a million benefit recorded in the year ended september  resulting from our execution of a sublease agreement in june and revisions of our estimates in the northern california real estate market in fiscal years and the decrease in operating expenses is also attributed to an overall million decrease in stock based compensation million of the overall decrease is within operating expenses primarily due to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by a million or increase in compensation and benefits expense associated with an increase in average sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative headcount in supporting our transition to an on demand model  an increase in sales commission due to reversals of million in the year ended september  based on the expiration of statute of limitations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a million insurance reimbursement in the year ended september  related to litigation expenses  and an increase in intellectual property related legal expenses of million 
in sum  our total net expenses  including cost of revenue and other items  decreased to million compared to million in the year ended september   which caused a net loss for the year of million compared to million in the year ended september  outlook for fiscal year with our increased backlog  introduction of new offerings and continued shift in demand toward subscription sales  we expect continued growth in subscription revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we believe that our success for fiscal year will depend largely on our ability to manage the continuing shift to an on demand delivery model from both a product and a financial standpoint  sell bundled solution offerings that include both technology and expert services  renew our subscription or time based revenues  including on demand software fees  maintenance fees  and fees for certain services  capitalize on new revenue opportunities  such as fees for the ariba supplier network and selling on demand spend management solutions to smaller and mid market customers  and complete our pending acquisition of procuri and effectively manage the integration of its operations with our business 
we believe that key risks to our revenues in fiscal year include our ability to introduce additional on demand versions of our products in fiscal year  our ability to renew ratable revenue streams without substantial declines from prior arrangements  including subscription software  software maintenance and 
table of contents subscription services  the impact of transitioning managed procurement customers to subscription software customers  our ability to generate organic growth  our deferral of services revenues as a result of including software implementation and other services as part of a sale with our subscription software solutions  the market acceptance of spend management solutions as a standalone market category  the overall level of information technology spending  our ability to close and recognize benefits from the procuri acquisition  and potential declines in average selling prices 
we believe that key risks to our future operating profitability include our ability to maintain or grow our revenues  our ability to maintain adequate utilization of our services organization  our ability to renew sublease agreements and find new tenants for abandoned space  and the potential adverse impacts resulting from legal proceedings 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies at a relatively early stage of development  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended september   and revenues please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements and application of critical accounting policies and estimates below for a description of our accounting policy related to revenue recognition 
license license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a shift from perpetual license sales to more subscription sales 
in the future  we believe that license revenues will continue to decline 
see outlook for fiscal year prospectively  commencing in fiscal year  we will present license revenues within services and other revenues 
license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a shift from perpetual license sales to more subscription sales and the difficult selling environment for enterprise software applications in the year ended september  we generally ship our software products shortly after entering into a license contract 
however  product shipment may be delayed for a number of factors  including factors within our discretion 
for example  delivery dates may be affected by the number of software license orders shipped or received in the quarter  the degree to which software license orders are concentrated at the end of the quarter  and our operational ability to fulfill software license orders at the end of the quarter 
any delay in shipping software products may have the effect of reducing revenue in the current period and increasing revenue in future periods 
subscription and maintenance subscription and maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million  an increase from subscription and maintenance revenues of million for the year ended september  subscription revenues consist mainly of fees for software access subscription and hosted software services 
subscription revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to growth in overall software bookings  a shift from perpetual license sales to more subscription sales and the growth of ariba supplier network revenue 
maintenance revenues consist primarily of ariba buyer and ariba sourcing product maintenance fees 
maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  although license revenues decreased during the same period  maintenance renewal revenue on our installed base remains relatively consistent

table of contents services and other services and other revenues were million for the year ended september   a decrease from services and other revenues of million for the year ended september  the decrease of million in services and other revenues is primarily due to a decline in renewals of sourcing services revenues in the year ended september  and a slight increase in the deferral of consulting services revenues in the year ended september  due to such services being bundled with other products or services without evidence of fair value 
we anticipate that services and other revenues will decline in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the transition of managed procurement customers to subscription software customers 
services and other revenues were million for the year ended september   a decrease from services and other revenues of million for the year ended september  the decrease of million in services and other revenues is primarily due to the deferral of approximately million of consulting services revenues in the year ended september  due to such services being bundled with other products or services without evidence of fair value  and due to a decline in implementation revenues

goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform a test for impairment on an annual basis or as events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired and that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual assessment for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in june  based on a combination of factors  particularly our market capitalization at that time  our then current and projected operating results  significant trends in the enterprise software industry  and our decision to reduce our workforce and eliminate excess facility space  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to assess whether any portion of our recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
we determined that our estimated fair value was less than the recorded amount of our net assets  thereby necessitating that we assess our recorded goodwill for impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment  we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value 
table of contents of the company to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
based on this allocation  we concluded that goodwill was impaired in the amount of million 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal years  and  and no further indication of goodwill impairment was noted

these transactions resulted in a million reduction to minority interests during the year ended september  for the year ended september   we increased consolidated net loss by  as the minority interest s share of income 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash of million 
our working capital on september  was million 
all significant cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments are held in accounts in the united states 
as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash of million 
our working capital on september  was million 
the increase in total cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash of million in the year ended september  is primarily attributable to our results of operations  excluding non cash charges for stock based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and non cash income of million from the softbank transaction 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash is also attributable to continued improved cash collections on outstanding accounts receivable in the year ended september  net cash from operating activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash from operating activities of million for the year ended september  cash flows from operating activities decreased million primarily due to a higher net loss excluding non cash charges and a million increase in payments on lease abandonment accruals due to a payment of million associated

in the year ended september   we returned million of the interim payments received in connection with the softbank arbitration proceedings  which represented the amounts owed to ariba for software and support under the strategic relationship with softbank  and received million from softbank for a three year software license of the ariba sourcing and ariba analysis product lines  an increase from a million insurance reimbursement related to litigation matters in the nine months ended september   an increase from reduced cash payments of restructuring obligations of million in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily for severance and benefit costs as part of the restructuring program in fiscal year to realign our business model with freemarkets  an increase from improved results of operations  excluding non cash charges  in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   and an increase from improved collections on outstanding accounts receivable in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  these items were partially offset by a million payment received from a subtenant in the year ended september  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in purchases of investments  net of sales of million  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of million due to purchases of computer equipment in the year ended september  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to the allocation of the interim payments received in connection with the softbank arbitration proceeding from restricted cash and the change in sales of marketable securities  net of purchases of million  partially offset by the settlement of the minority interests from softbank and other minority interest shareholders of million in the year ended september  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  the repurchase of common stock in both periods represents shares forfeited to ariba by employees in satisfaction of statutory tax withholding obligations incurred as a result of the vesting of restricted shares of common stock held by those employees 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock in both periods is attributed to stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase program 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended september  of million is attributed to a change in the terms of the employee stock purchase plan in august whereby the option component of the plan was eliminated see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended september  of million is attributed to a million increase in the repurchase of common stock as a result of statutory tax withholding incurred upon the vesting of restricted shares of common stock held by employees and a million decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan due to offering our employees the opportunity to exchange outstanding stock options for restricted shares of our common stock in the year ended september  
table of contents as of september   we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations our primary contractual obligations are under our operating leases and letters of credit which are discussed below 
in march  we entered into a facility lease agreement for  square feet in four office buildings and an amenities building in sunnyvale  california for our headquarters 
the operating lease term commenced in and ends in january we occupy  square feet in this facility  and currently sublease two buildings totaling  square feet to third parties 
these subleases expire in august and january the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
minimum monthly lease payments are million and escalate annually  with the total future minimum lease payments amounting to million over the remaining lease term 
as part of this lease agreement  we are required to issue standby letters of credit backed by cash equivalents  totaling million as of september   as a form of security through fiscal year also  we are required by other lease agreements to hold an additional  of standby letters of credit  which are cash collateralized 
these instruments are issued by our banks in lieu of a cash security deposit required by landlords for domestic and international real estate leases 
the total cash collateral of million is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we also occupy  square feet of office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease that expires in december this location consists principally of our services organization and administrative activities 
future minimum lease payments and sublease income under noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of september  in thousands year ending september  lease payments contractual sublease income net obligations thereafter total the above table represents our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the specific timing and actual amounts of payments 
of the total operating lease commitments as of september  noted above  million is for occupied properties and million is for abandoned properties  which are a component of the restructuring obligation 
other than the lease commitments and letters of credit discussed above  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
we do not have any material noncancelable purchase commitments as of september  
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated limited purpose entities  nor do we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
anticipated cash flows we expect to incur significant operating costs  particularly related to services delivery costs  sales and marketing  research and development and restructuring costs  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating costs  as well as the pending acquisition of procuri  will constitute a use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales  changes in deferred revenues  our ability to manage infrastructure costs  the outcome of our subleasing activities related to abandoned excess leased facilities and ongoing regulatory and legal proceedings 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource requirements for at least the next twelve months 
should we find it necessary to obtain additional funds  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and  in part  are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring obligations related to abandoned operating leases and contingencies related to the collectibility of accounts receivable and pending litigation 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from three sources i providing subscription software solutions on either a multi tenant or single tenant basis and associated technical support and product updates  otherwise known as subscription and maintenance  ii providing services  including implementation services  consulting services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous services  and iii licensing perpetual software 
the significant majority of our standard end user license agreements provide for use of our software under a time based license based on the number of users or other usage criteria 
we license our software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of some or all of the following i software solutions  either on a standalone or on demand basis  ii a maintenance arrangement  which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees and provides for technical support and unspecified product updates typically over a period of one year or over the term of the license  and iii a services arrangement  on either a fixed fee for access to specific services over time or a time and materials basis 
we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers 
sales made through resellers are generally recognized at the time that we have received persuasive evidence of an end user customer 
the license agreements for our products generally do not provide for a right of return  and historically product 
table of contents returns have not been significant 
we do not recognize revenue for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancel have expired 
direct sales force commissions are included as sales and marketing expense at the time of sale  when the liability is incurred and is reasonably estimable 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the inception of the arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until the fee is collected 
we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value 
our determination of the fair value of each element in a multiple element arrangement accounted for under sop is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is limited to the price when sold separately 
vsoe or other methods of determining fair value that are allowable under eitf are utilized for multiple element arrangements that are not subject to sop revenue from software solutions  hosting and sourcing solutions services is primarily recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  commencing with the initial customer access date 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to software solutions implementation  process improvement  training and other services is recognized as the services are performed or as milestones are achieved or if bundled with a subscription or time based service  or in circumstances where fair value cannot be established for undelivered service elements  is recognized ratably over the term of the access agreement 
certain of our contracts include performance incentive payments based on market volume and or savings generated  as defined in the respective contracts 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized when those thresholds are achieved 
when revenue associated with multiple element arrangements is recognized and more than one element in an arrangement does not have fair value  we first allocate revenue on the statement of operations to those elements for which evidence of fair value is available 
in circumstances where we provide consulting services as part of a multi element arrangement with software solutions  both the software solution revenue and service revenue are recognized under the lesser of proportional performance method based on hours or ratable over the term of the license 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized  and generally results from deferred subscription  maintenance and support  hosting  consulting or training services not yet rendered and recognizable under eitf and license revenue deferred until all requirements of sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements under sab  eitf or sop are satisfied 
deferred revenue excludes contract amounts for which payment has yet to be collected 
likewise  accounts receivable excludes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been deferred 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide for actual losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of 
table of contents judgment is required when we assess the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts might be required 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for the remaining customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the aggregate receivables are outstanding  the current business environment and historical experience 
alternatively  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve such that their ability to make payments was no longer considered impaired  we would reduce related estimated reserves with a credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below the recorded amount of our net assets for a sustained period 
our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines in the past 
in june  based on a combination of factors  particularly our market capitalization at that time  our then current and projected operating results  significant trends in the enterprise software industry  and our decision to reduce our workforce and eliminate excess facility space  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to assess whether any portion of our recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
we determined that our estimated fair value was less than the recorded amount of our net assets  thereby necessitating that we assess our recorded goodwill for impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment  we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the company to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
based on this allocation  we concluded that goodwill was impaired in the amount of million 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal years and and no further indication of goodwill impairment was noted 
the remaining balance of goodwill is million as of september   and there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
lease abandonment costs we initially recorded a significant restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year upon abandoning certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
in the years ended september   and  we revised our original estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts as a result of changed estimates of sublease rental projections 
during the year ended september   we revised our estimates for sublease rental projections resulting in a charge of million 
we also recorded a million adjustment to our restructuring obligation 
table of contents in march that was related to a prior period 
based on the guidance in sab  we concluded that the amount of the prior period error was immaterial to fiscal years and in july  we re assessed our office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania and ceased use of one of the floors we leased through  which resulted in a charge of million 
finally  we recorded a million adjustment to the restructuring obligation due to the closure of an excess legacy freemarkets facility 
this restructuring adjustment was considered part of purchase accounting for freemarkets and was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
during the year ended september   we revised our estimates for sublease rental rate projections to reflect continued soft market conditions in the northern california real estate market and sublease commencement dates  resulting in a charge of million 
the remaining charge in the year ended september  was related to property taxes of  based on a property tax audit assessment related to calendar years through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and an adjustment to the company s restructuring obligation related to a prior period 
the cumulative understatement of expenses for periods prior to the year ended september  was approximately  we concluded that the effect of the adjustment was not material to fiscal year and the prior periods 
we recorded the cumulative understatement as an increase in restructuring and integration expense and to total operating expenses during the year ended september  during the year ended september   we also recorded a  decrease to the restructuring obligation due to the assignment of a lease of an excess legacy freemarkets facility 
the reversal of the remaining obligation related to this facility was recorded as a decrease to goodwill 
during the year ended september   we recorded a net benefit to operations of million 
in june  we entered into an amendment with juniper  the successor in interest to netscreen to the sublease dated as of october  between ariba and netscreen 
pursuant to the amendment  juniper agreed to renew its sublease of approximately  square feet of space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january in addition  juniper agreed  effective october   to lease approximately  square feet of additional space at our sunnyvale  california headquarters through january also in june  we revised our estimates for rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates to reflect current market conditions primarily in the northern california real estate market 
the impact of the execution of the sublease agreement with juniper was a benefit to operations of approximately million and the impact of the revised estimated rental rate projections and sub lease commencement dates was a charge to operations of million  resulting in a net benefit to operations of million in the year ended september  lease abandonment costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sublessees and sublease rates using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
we review these estimates each quarterly reporting period  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of september   we had contractual commitments of million for abandoned properties 
our lease abandonment accrual is net of million of estimated sublease income 
actual sublease payments due under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities totaled million as of september  and the remainder of anticipated sublease income represents management s estimate of amounts to be received under future subleases 
actual future cash requirements and lease abandonment costs may differ materially from the accrual at september   particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates 
these differences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position 
for example  a reduction in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the remaining term of the lease  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on our sunnyvale  california headquarters by approximately million as of september  
table of contents legal contingencies we are subject to various claims and legal actions 
see legal proceedings 
we accrue for estimated losses in accordance with gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
although we currently believe that we have properly accrued for estimable and probable losses regarding the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving us  litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition or that the current amount of accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products primarily in the united states and india and market our products primarily in the united states  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our non us sales are priced in currencies other than the us dollar  a strengthening of the dollar may reduce the level of reported revenues 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a large portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the years ended september   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of the united states 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to reduce our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations denominated in local currency 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  all of these instruments are marked to market at each balance sheet date by a charge to earnings 
we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of september  in thousands buy sell contract value unrealized gain loss in usd foreign currency usd foreign currency euro sell   japanese yen sell   swiss franc buy  czech koruna buy  singapore dollar buy british pound buy total the unrealized gain loss represents the difference between the contract value and the market value of the contract based on market rates as of september  given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates upon which these forward exchange contracts are based would result in unrealized exchange gains or losses of approximately  in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange losses or gains on the underlying net monetary exposures 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from other foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment 
table of contents activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and as such we may suffer losses at the time of sale due to the decline in market value
