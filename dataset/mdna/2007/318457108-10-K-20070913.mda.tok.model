item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the caption risk factors 
general we are principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance  based in nashville  tennessee 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type 
generally  our customers are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
prior to our april  acquisition of usauto holdings  inc  we were engaged in pursuing opportunities to acquire one or more operating companies 
in addition  we marketed for sale a portfolio of foreclosed real estate 
we will continue to market the remaining real estate held  consisting of two tracts of land in san antonio  texas  and will attempt to sell it on a basis that provides us with the best economic return 
we do not anticipate any new investments in real estate 
as of august   we leased and operated retail locations  staffed by employee agents 
our employee agents exclusively sell insurance products either underwritten or serviced by us 
as of august   we wrote non standard personal automobile insurance in states and were licensed in additional states 
the following table shows the changes in the number of our retail locations for the periods presented 
retail location counts are based upon the date that a location commenced writing business 
year ended june  retail locations beginning of period opened acquired closed retail locations end of period the following table shows the number of our retail locations by state 
june  alabama florida georgia illinois indiana mississippi missouri ohio pennsylvania south carolina tennessee texas total 
table of contents consolidated results of operations overview our primary focus is the selling  servicing and underwriting of non standard personal automobile insurance 
our real estate and corporate segment consists of activities related to the disposition of foreclosed real estate held for sale  interest expense associated with debt  and other general corporate overhead expenses 
the following table presents selected financial data for our insurance operations and real estate and corporate segments for the periods presented year ended june  in thousands revenues insurance real estate and corporate consolidated total income loss before income taxes insurance real estate and corporate consolidated total our insurance operations generate revenues from selling  servicing and underwriting non standard personal automobile insurance policies in states 
we conduct our underwriting operations through three insurance company subsidiaries  first acceptance insurance company  inc  first acceptance insurance company of georgia  inc 
and first acceptance insurance company of tennessee  inc our insurance revenues are generated from premiums earned  including policy and renewal fees  from sales of policies written and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries  fee income  including installment billing fees on policies written as well as fees for other ancillary services principally a motor club product  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries 
the following table presents gross premiums earned by state and includes policies written and assumed by the insurance company subsidiaries and policies issued by our managing general agency mga subsidiaries on behalf of other insurance companies that are assumed by one of our insurance company subsidiaries through quota share reinsurance 
prior to may  we were not licensed to write insurance in alabama and therefore one of our insurance companies assumed a percentage of the business written in alabama through an mga subsidiary 
the assumed percentage was from july  through february   and following february  since may  all new alabama business has been written by one of our insurance company subsidiaries on a direct basis 
although we are licensed in texas  we currently write some business in texas through the texas county mutual insurance company system that is assumed by one of our insurance company subsidiaries 
for the months of july and august of  we ceded of our gross premiums earned to a reinsurer under a quota share reinsurance agreement that was non renewed effective september  premiums ceded after september  reflect only the cost of catastrophic reinsurance 
effective april   we elected to not renew our catastrophic reinsurance 

table of contents year ended june  in thousands gross premiums earned georgia florida texas illinois alabama tennessee ohio south carolina indiana pennsylvania missouri mississippi total gross premiums earned premiums ceded premiums not assumed total net premiums earned the following table presents the change in the total number of policies in force for the insurance operations for the periods presented 
policies in force increase as a result of new policies issued and decrease as a result of policies that cancel or expire and are not renewed 
year ended june  policies in force beginning of period acquired net increase during period policies in force end of period insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned  net of ceded reinsurance 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of operating expenses to premiums earned 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
we calculate this ratio on a net basis as a percentage of net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by fee income from insureds and ceding commissions received from our quota share reinsurer as compensation for the costs we incurred in servicing this business on their behalf 
our expense ratio for fiscal excludes expenses and fee income related to incidental mga operations 
for the period from january  through december   our operating expenses were reduced by a transaction service fee we received for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago agencies whose business we acquired in january combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the combined ratios for our insurance operations for the periods presented 

table of contents year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense combined the invested assets of the insurance operations are generally highly liquid and consist substantially of readily marketable  investment grade  municipal and corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations 
we invest in certain securities issued by political subdivisions in the states of georgia and tennessee  as these types of investments enable our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is composed primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses on our investment portfolio may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates and changes in the credit quality of securities held 
the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
in the past  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity 
if new competitors enter this market  existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
such conditions could lead to reduced prices  which would negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
we believe that between and  the underwriting results in the personal automobile insurance industry improved as a result of favorable pricing and competitive conditions that allowed for broad increases in rate levels by insurers 
however  since then we have witnessed a stabilization followed by a reduction in premiums and rates across most states 
given the cyclical nature of the industry  these conditions may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
year ended june  compared with the year ended june  consolidated results revenues for the year ended june  increased to million from million in the prior year 
net loss for the year ended june  was million  compared with net income of million for the year ended june  basic and diluted net income loss per share was for the year ended june   compared with and  respectively  for the year ended june  the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  includes an increase in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million per share on a diluted basis as well as million per share on a diluted basis related to the expiration of certain net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a deferred tax asset charge totaling million per share on a diluted basis  while the benefit from income taxes for the year ended june  includes a decrease in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million per share on a diluted basis 
the increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended june  was due to revisions in management s estimates for our future taxable income based on the results for the most recent fiscal year  while the charge related to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards was due to taxable income for the current fiscal year being less than management s prior estimates 
the decrease for the year ended june  was the result of taxable income exceeding the estimates used by management in establishing the valuation allowances at june  and  respectively  in addition to revisions in management s estimates for our future taxable income 
net income per share for the year ended june  included gains on sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale of million per share on a diluted basis 
insurance operations revenues from insurance operations were million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  income before income taxes from insurance operations for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the year ended june  
table of contents premiums earned for the year ended june   premiums earned increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to the expansion of our business 
approximately of the premium growth was in florida  texas and south carolina  where we opened locations in fiscal year  and chicago  where we acquired locations in january the total number of insured policies in force at june  increased over the same date in from  to  at june   we operated retail locations or stores  compared with stores at june  commission and fee income commissions and fee income increased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this increase was the result of the growth in net premiums earned 
however  fee income increased at a rate lower than our increase in premiums earned because we charge lower fees in florida compared with our other states 
investment income investment income increased primarily as a result of the increase in the amount of invested assets 
the weighted average investment yields for our fixed maturities portfolio were and at june  and  respectively  with effective durations of years and years at june  and  respectively 
the yields for the comparable lehman brothers indices were at june  and other other revenues for the year ended june  included million  compared with million for the prior year  from a transaction service fee earned through december in connection with the chicago acquisition for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago agencies whose assets we acquired in january we will not receive this transaction service fee in future periods 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june  compared with for the same period last year 
for the year ended june   we experienced a negative development for losses occurring in prior accident periods of approximately million 
for the premiums earned during this fiscal year  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 
during fiscal  we experienced significant unanticipated increases in the frequency of pip losses in florida  the severity of bodily injury bi losses in florida and georgia  and the severity of property damage losses in georgia and other states 
the higher than anticipated severity in georgia bi losses was somewhat driven by a higher than anticipated occurrence of large losses losses of  or above 
to a lesser extent  the increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the current year was the result of a change in our business mix resulting from premium growth in our emerging states of florida and texas where we anticipated higher loss ratios 
in january  we hired a new head of product management with significant experience in rate making for the non standard automobile insurance sector 
we have filed new rates  which are currently effective in florida commenced december  south carolina and georgia commenced march and pennsylvania commenced september  
we are currently preparing a rate filing for texas  which we expect to file on or before september  we expect to file new rates in the emerging states of illinois  missouri  indiana and ohio within the next days 
we will file new rates for bodily injury  medical payments  and uninsured motorists coverage in florida  in conjunction with the change in florida coverage resulting from the october  expiration of florida s motor vehicle no fault law personal injury protection  or pip 
we also expect to file for new rates for our other florida coverages ie  property damage  comprehensive and collision  etc 
within days  which should be approved and made effective prior to december  while the scheduled elimination of the pip coverage will result in a decline in premiums earned in florida  it may improve our overall loss ratio for florida 
our loss ratio exclusive of loss adjustment expenses for florida pip coverage was and for the three months and year ended june   respectively  on premiums earned of million and million for the respective periods 

table of contents operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the addition in fiscal of new retail locations including those acquired in chicago and expenses  such as advertising  employee agent compensation  rent and premium taxes that vary along with the increase in net premiums earned 
the expense ratio decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily a result of the increase in premiums earned from new stores without a corresponding increase in fixed operating costs such as advertising  rent and base compensation of our employee agents 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  as a result of the higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
real estate and corporate loss before income taxes from real estate and corporate for the year ended june  was million versus income before income taxes of million for the year ended june  the year ended june  included gains on sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale of million 
there were no gains on sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale during the year ended june  in addition  during the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with borrowings related to the chicago acquisition compared with million for the year ended june  year ended june  compared with the year ended june  consolidated results net income for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the year ended june  net income per share was and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  for the year ended june  and and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  for the year ended june  total revenues for the year ended june  increased from million to million over the same period last year 
the benefit from income taxes for the years ended june  and included decreases in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million per share on a diluted basis and million per share on a diluted basis  respectively 
such decreases were the result of taxable income for these years exceeding the estimates used by management in establishing the valuation allowances at june  and  respectively  in addition to revisions in management s estimates for our future taxable income based on the results for the most recent fiscal years 
net income per share for the year ended june  included gains on sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale of million per share on a diluted basis compared with gains of million per share on a diluted basis for the year ended june  insurance operations revenues from insurance operations were million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  income before income taxes from insurance operations was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june  premiums earned total gross premiums earned  before the effects of reinsurance  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this increase was due to the development of new stores in existing states as well as our expansion into new states 
of 
table of contents this increase  million was attributable to the expansion of our business into florida and texas 
overall  the number of insured policies in force at june  increased over the same date in from  to  at june   the number of operating retail locations or stores was as compared with stores at june  net premiums earned increased for the year ended june  over the same period in in addition to the increase in total gross premiums earned  net premiums earned also increased as a result of two changes involving reinsurance 
net premiums earned increased as a result of the change in the assumed reinsurance percentage for our alabama business written through other insurance companies from to effective february  for the year ended june   million in premiums earned in alabama were not assumed by us 
we are now licensed in alabama and  starting in may  we began writing all new policies in alabama on a direct basis 
as a result  in alabama  we no longer incur the contractual costs associated with writing business through another insurance company 
net premiums earned for the year ended june  also increased as the result of eliminating our quota share reinsurance effective september  this reinsurance was in effect for two months of the year ended june  and resulted in an million reduction in net premiums earned  which we ceded to the reinsurer 
commission and fee income commission and fee income declined as a percentage of net premiums earned during the year ended june  compared with the prior year as a result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance and increasing the assumed reinsurance percentage for our alabama business 
ceding commissions from our reinsurer were eliminated with the non renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement 
investment income investment income increased primarily as a result of the increase in invested assets as a result of our growth and to a lesser extent as we shifted the portfolio from tax exempt to taxable investments 
the weighted average investment yield for our fixed maturities portfolio was at june  with an effective duration of years 
the yield for the comparable lehman brothers indices at june  was other other revenues for the year ended june  included a million transaction service fee earned in connection with the chicago acquisition for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago agencies whose assets we acquired in january loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  for the year ended june   we experienced a positive development for losses occurring in prior accident periods of million  which we believe was attributable to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and was not the result of any individual factor 
the loss ratio for the year ended june  increased primarily as a result of higher loss ratios in our expansion states and from an increase in storm losses 
operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the addition of new retail locations including those acquired in chicago and expenses  such as advertising  employee agent compensation  rent and premium taxes that vary along with the increase in net premiums earned 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the expense ratio for the year ended june  was positively impacted by an additional ceding commission of million  or  which was recorded based upon the favorable loss experience during the last year of the quota share reinsurance which was non renewed effective september  operating expenses 
table of contents incurred for new retail locations also contributed to the increase in the expense ratio for the year ended june  in addition  the expense ratio increased as a result of declining fee income from ancillary products which reduces expenses in calculating the expense ratio  and the fact that this fee income was spread over a larger base of net premiums earned as a result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  real estate and corporate income before income taxes from real estate and corporate for the year ended june  was million versus a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  the year ended june  included gains on the sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale of million compared with million for the year ended june  investment income declined from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  primarily due to a reduction in the amount of invested assets 
other operating expenses primarily include other general corporate overhead expenses 
during the year ended june   we incurred severance costs of million in connection with the resignation of a former executive officer 
in addition  for the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with borrowings related to the chicago acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are premiums  fee income and investment income 
our primary uses of funds are the payment of claims and operating expenses 
operating activities for the year ended june  provided million of cash  compared with million provided in the same period in fiscal net cash used by investing activities for the year ended june  was million  compared with million in the same period in fiscal both periods reflect net additions to our investment portfolio as a result of the increase in net premiums earned 
during the year ended june   we sold fixed maturity investments of million that were subsequently reinvested 
these sales and reinvestments were primarily related to weekly auction rate securities that were reinvested longer term and portfolio changes made in order to help obtain premium tax credits in certain states 
in december  we borrowed million from our revolving credit facility and used the proceeds to increase the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we repaid this amount in july during the year ended june   we increased the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries by a total of million to support additional premium writings 
of this capital contribution  million came from funds our holding company received from our insurance company subsidiaries through an intercompany tax allocation agreement under which the holding company was reimbursed for current tax benefits utilized through the recognition of tax net operating loss carryforwards 
the balance of the capital contribution came from million of unrestricted cash  million from the borrowing under the revolving credit facility and million from the proceeds of trust preferred securities sold by one of our subsidiaries in june at june   we had million available in unrestricted cash and investments outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
of these funds  in july  we used million to pay down the revolving credit facility and million to pay scheduled quarterly payments of principal and interest on our debt 
future debt payments will be serviced by the additional unrestricted cash from the sources described in the next paragraph 
we are part of an insurance holding company system with substantially all of our operations conducted by our insurance company subsidiaries 
accordingly  the holding company will only receive cash from operating activities as a result of investment income and the ultimate liquidation of our foreclosed real estate held for sale 
it will also receive dividends from non insurance company subsidiaries that sell ancillary products to our insureds 
cash could be made available through loans from financial institutions  the sale of securities  and dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries 
in addition  as a result of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  taxable income generated by the insurance company subsidiaries will provide cash to the holding company through an intercompany tax allocation agreement through which the insurance company subsidiaries reimburse the holding company for current tax benefits utilized through recognition of the net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from our insurance company subsidiaries 
these limitations relate to statutory capital and surplus and net income 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
a low rbc ratio would prevent an insurance company from paying dividends 
statutory guidelines suggest that the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to we believe that our insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient financial resources available to support their net premium writings in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows generated from operations and dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions 
any acquisitions or other growth opportunities may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing 
we cannot assure you that additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  or that any such financing would not negatively impact our results of operations 
chicago acquisition in order to gain a presence in the market  on january   we acquired certain assets principally the trade names  customer lists and relationships and the lease rights to retail locations of two non standard automobile insurance agencies under common control in chicago  illinois for million in cash 
in addition  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition  million of additional consideration was paid in march based on attainment of certain financial targets 
no further amounts are due from the company in connection with this acquisition 
credit facility in connection with the chicago acquisition  we entered into  and borrowed under  a credit agreement with two banks consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility  both maturing on june  through september   both facilities bore interest at libor plus basis points per annum 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on january  that fixed the interest rate on the term loan facility at through june  at june   the swap  which qualifies as a cash flow hedge  had a fair value of million and is included within other assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss 
payments receipts associated with the swap are reported in the statement of operations as a part of interest expense 
the term loan facility is due in equal quarterly installments through june  both facilities are secured by the common stock and certain assets of our non regulated subsidiaries 
for the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with the noted credit agreement 
at june   the unpaid balance due under the facilities was million 
at june   we were not in compliance with financial covenants in the credit agreement regarding a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum combined ratio 
our lenders waived this non compliance as of june  and we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement dated september  the amended terms have less restrictive financial covenants  increased the interest rate we pay by basis points and require us to make a prepayment of at least million in principal before december  in addition  the availability under the revolving credit facility was permanently reduced from million to million 
trust preferred securities on june   first acceptance statutory trust i fast i  our newly formed wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust entity  completed a private placement whereby fast i issued  shares of preferred securities at  per share to outside investors and  shares of common securities to us  also at  per share

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting policies losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period  but have not been paid 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported  which are referred to herein as incurred but not reported  or ibnr  reserves 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including case and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate unpaid liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our internal actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
we utilized our internal actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
see business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for additional information 
revenue recognition 
insurance premiums earned are recognized on a pro rata basis over the respective terms of the policies 
written premiums are recorded as of the effective date of the policies for the full policy premium although most policyholders elect to pay on a monthly installment basis 
policy and renewal fees are included in premiums earned and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the respective terms of the policies 
premiums are generally collected in advance of providing risk coverage  minimizing our exposure to credit risk 
premiums receivable are recorded net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
commission income and related policy fees  written for affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies  are recognized at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy  whichever is later 
commissions on premium endorsements are recognized when premiums are processed 
motor club fees written by an affiliate are earned on a pro rata basis over the respective terms of the contracts and included within commission and fee income 
fees are paid monthly by motor club members and are generally collected in advance of providing coverage  minimizing our exposure to credit risk 
fee income includes agency and installment fees to compensate us for the costs of providing installment payment plans  as well as late payment  policy cancellation  policy rewrite and reinstatement fees 
we recognize these fees on a collected basis 
installment billing fees paid by policyholders are recognized as revenue when each installment is billed 
valuation of deferred tax asset 
income taxes are maintained in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting policy because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 

table of contents based on business activity prior to the usauto acquisition  management believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of the loss carryforwards 
therefore  a full valuation allowance had been established 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income after the usauto acquisition  we reduced our deferred tax valuation allowance by million 
further  based upon our revised estimates after considering the actual results for the year ended june   the allowance was increased by million  while the years ended june  and included reductions in the allowance of million and million  respectively 
in addition  during the year ended june   the provision for income taxes included a million charge related to the expiration of certain net operating loss carryforwards due to taxable income for the current fiscal year being less than management s prior estimates 
at june   our total gross deferred tax asset is million  and we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
on a net basis  the deferred tax asset is million after an allowance of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
if future taxable income is not sufficient to recover the deferred tax asset  the maximum charge to the provision for income taxes will be million 
if we generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the deferred tax asset as of june   the maximum additional benefit for income taxes will be million 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
our acquisitions have resulted in goodwill of million 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the acquisitions also resulted in other identifiable intangible assets with a current book value of million 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
if impairment indicators exist between the annual testing periods  management will perform an interim impairment test 
should either an annual or interim impairment test determine that the fair value is below the carrying value  a write down of these assets will be required 
at june   impairment tests were performed and in management s opinion  no impairment exists

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an exposure to interest rate risk relating to fixed maturity investments 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities

at june   million was borrowed under the revolving facility 
in july  we repaid the million outstanding under the revolving credit facility
