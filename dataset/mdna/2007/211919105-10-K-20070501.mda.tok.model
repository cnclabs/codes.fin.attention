item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company principally earns revenues from the licensing of its software products and the provision of services in deployment of the company s technology to government agencies and commercial businesses throughout north america  europe and other parts of the world 
the company licenses its retrievalware software to end users directly and also distributes its software products through license agreements with value added resellers  system integrators  original equipment manufacturers and other strategic partners 
revenues are generated from software licenses with customers and from the related sale of product maintenance  training and professional services 
additions to the number of authorized users  licenses issued for additional products and the renewal of product maintenance arrangements by customers pursuant to existing licenses also provide revenues to the company 
under software maintenance contracts  customers are typically entitled to receive telephone support  software bug fixes and upgrades or enhancements of particular software products when and if they are released 
with respect to the company s excalibur web product  revenues may be derived from either a license model as described  or from a hosted service offering 
the company believes its retrievalware product has unique capabilities supporting the needs of customers within government agencies that will enable it to capitalize on current market opportunities and achieve its operational goals 
going forward  the company expects to focus a substantial amount of resources on further penetration of the national security  defense  law enforcement and intelligence gathering community with the united states and its allies 
an important objective in this market is to upgrade existing installations of older versions of retrievalware to the retrievalware platform that includes technical advancements such as categorization  dynamic classification  profiling and distributed indexing software capabilities 
on march   the company agreed to sell the assets of its retrievalware business for million in cash to fast search transfer fast 
under this agreement  fast will assume certain obligations of the business and will retain the professionals serving its enterprise search customers  the company anticipates that the closing of this transaction will occur in the second quarter of fiscal for further discussion of this transaction  see note  subsequent events  to notes to consolidated financial statements 
further  the company expects to increase its development  selling marketing efforts with regard to its excalibur web product 
excalibur is an advanced effort aimed at applying portions of the company s existing technology to searching and indexing contextually relevant information on the web 
the excalibur platform became commercially available on november  the primary market for the excalibur platform is the bb publisher industry  which has thousands of printed periodicals that are distributed to professionals 
the company partners directly with leading bb publishers in its excalibur offering  excalibur provides bb publishers with a more cost effective way to accelerate the transition from providing periodical hard content in printed form to providing their content dynamically to viewers and participants of interactive on line vertical communities 
excalibur delivers a vertical slice of the web that is 
totally 
relevant for a particular vertical community  affording the professional users ready access to the most relevant information to perform their work 
under its agreements with the bb publishers the company receives a percentage of website advertising revenue typically between and of net advertising revenues or subscription fees or income based on the level of end user search queries 
the company can also generate professional services fees depending upon customer web site customization requirements 
the first excalibur supported site was launched into production in november as of march   there are a total of six excalibur supported websites in production from four bb publishers and a total of websites in pilot phase awaiting launch 
we believe that these pilot sites will be launched within the next days 
the company expects additional revenue growth to be generated by the fast ad momentum platform it acquired on march  this ad platform is being integrated with excalibur  and will enable publishers to directly manage and improve their professional communities search experiences and pursue search based revenues for their web sites 
this ad platform is also expected to work as an additional marketing channel that will connect the publisher websites supported by excalibur directly with the providers of advertising inventory  increasing the opportunities for the excalibur supported sites to further increase their ad revenues 
in concert with the excalibur product offering  the company entered into a hosting facility agreement with at t and  as of january   had established two hosting centers san diego  ca and dallas  tx 
excalibur sales and marketing efforts are focused on the top bb publishers 
these publishers possess large  rapidly changing content collections in diverse formats and reach a large number of end users 
excalibur operating costs  including the cost of excalibur hosted services and excalibur research and product development costs  totaled million in fiscal going forward  cash outlays will be limited to equipment  personnel and general operating costs  including marketing activities 
the company expects to continue to increase its investment in excalibur and may also elect to seek additional funding sources for this effort 
the company may also elect to seek additional and or alternative market segments for the excalibur offering over the coming quarters 
management s primary objective is to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations without hampering development  sales and marketing efforts 
the company is committed to investing in the enhancement of its products to meet the needs of its customers and prospects 
to achieve its main objective  the company continually evaluates revenue opportunities to determine the market sectors in which the company should concentrate its sales and marketing efforts 
the company s business environment and the search software industry in general are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  changes in customer requirements and emerging new market segments 
the company competes within the commercial sector where its market position has not been as strong as it has been within the government sector 
as such  the company has elected to focus the majority of its efforts within the commercial setting on the media and publishing sectors 
the company believes this segment may afford greater opportunities when compared to addressing a wide array of commercial market segments 
the company s competitors include many companies that are larger and more established and have substantially more resources 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
to address the competition  the company will continue to invest in research and development to advance its leadership position in linguistic analysis  scalability  performance  and taxonomy development and deployment 
the company may also make additional investments in specific product features to better serve the needs of customers looking for online customer service and support solutions and with regard to the excalibur web product  may elect to create a public search portal

the company recorded a net restructuring charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this effort 
the company will continue to invest in its excalibur web product  such that on a consolidated basis  the company is expected to remain in a net loss position until such time as excalibur is accepted into the commercial marketplace and certain levels of revenue are attained 
a detailed review of the numerous risks and challenges facing the company is contained in the risk factors section beginning on page critical accounting policies convera s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
convera does not have any material ownership interest in any entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the company 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases those estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring costs  income taxes and litigation  on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
convera believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company generally derives revenue from selling software licenses  providing training and professional services  selling software maintenance and providing hosted services 
retrievalware revenue generally consists of software license  training and professional services and software maintenance  excalibur revenue generally consists of hosted services and can include training and other professional services and advertising revenue shares 
the company recognizes revenue for its retrievalware product in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
all revenue is recognized net of sales tax 
software licenses are sold to customers as a permanent license perpetual license or as a license for a definitive period of time term license historically  the company has not experienced significant returns or exchanges of its products 
provided that the fee is fixed and determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable  revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses and term licenses is recognized upon shipment of product if vsoe exists using the residual method 
when vsoe cannot be established  term license revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the license 
to the extent that a discount exists in a multiple element or bundled arrangement that includes a software license  the company attributes that discount entirely to the delivered elements utilizing the residual method as described in paragraph of sop as amended by sop the company generally utilizes the residual methodology for recognizing revenue related to multi element software agreements 
under the residual methodology  the company recognizes the arrangement fee as follows a the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  is deferred and b the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
this assumes that a all other applicable revenue recognition criteria in sop are met and b the fair value of all of the undelivered elements is less than the arrangement fee 
certain of the company s customers are original equipment manufacturers oems and resellers 
oem contracts generally stipulate that the company receive royalty payments from the sale of the oem s integrated product over the specified contract term  which generally range from two to five years 
the company generally receives prepaid royalties  due at varying dates  and is entitled to receive additional royalties in the event that the oem product sales exceed the level provided for by the guaranteed prepaid royalties 
with prepaid royalties  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the software and or software developer s kit  as appropriate  provided the payment terms are considered normal and customary for these types of arrangements  the fee is considered fixed and determinable  and all other criteria within sop have been met 
to the extent the oem product sales exceed the level provided for by the guaranteed prepaid royalty and additional royalties are due  the company generally recognizes the additional royalties as the sales occur 
reseller contracts generally stipulate royalties due to the company on the resale of the company s products and call for a guaranteed minimum royalty payment in exchange for the right to sell the company s products within a specified territory over a specified period of time 
the company recognizes the prepaid royalties as revenue upon delivery of the initial copy of the software  provided the payment terms are considered normal and customary for these types of arrangements  the fee is considered fixed and determinable  and all other criteria within sop have been met 
to the extent the reseller s product sales exceed the level provided for by the guaranteed minimum royalty and additional royalties are due  the company generally recognizes the additional royalties as the reseller sales occur 
customization work is sometimes required to ensure that the company s software functionality meets the requirements of its customers 
under these circumstances  the company s revenues are derived from fixed price contracts and revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
estimated losses on such contracts are charged against earnings in the period such losses become known 
these cost estimates underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
further  we believe that this method of recognition is closely aligned with the evolution of the work product as defined 
maintenance revenue related to customer support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the respective agreements 
customer support agreements generally include bug fixes  telephone support and product release upgrades on a when and if available basis 
when the company provides a software license and the related customer support arrangement for one bundled price  the fair value of the customer support  based on the price charged for that element when sold separately  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the respective agreement 
revenue from training and professional services is recognized when the services are performed 
such services are sold as part of a bundled software license agreement as well as separately to customers who have previously purchased software licenses 
when training or professional services that are not essential to the functionality of the software are sold as part of a bundled license agreement  the fair value of these services  based on the price charged for the services when sold separately  is deferred and recognized when the services are performed 
deferred revenue consists of deferred training and professional services revenues  deferred maintenance revenues and deferred license revenues 
the company incurs shipping and handling costs which are recorded in cost of license revenues 
excalibur hosted service revenues are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition 
the company evaluates excalibur hosted services arrangements that have multiple deliverables  in accordance with as emerging issues task force eitf abstract issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  multiple deliverable arrangements that contain elements that do not qualify as separate units of accounting are recognized ratably over term of the hosting arrangement 
excalibur hosted service agreements typically include monthly contract minimums and can also include advertising share revenue agreements 
monthly contract minimums and other hosting fees or set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
advertising share revenues are recognized when earned under the provisions of the hosting agreement 
no advertising revenue has been recorded to date under any of the hosted services agreements  however  as additional publisher vertical sites are launched and hosted on the company s excalibur product  the company will become dependent on its publisher customers to provide timely and accurate reports of the web advertising revenue sold by the publisher on each of these sites to determine its revenue 
provision for doubtful accounts convera maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on an analysis of the company s historical collection experience and the company s portfolio of customers taking into consideration the general economic environment as well as the industry in which the company operates 
to the extent convera does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent convera does not accurately estimate its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets convera s prior acquisitions of other companies resulted in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill resulting from these acquisitions is associated with the company s enterprise search software products reporting segment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the impairment of goodwill is assessed on an annual basis or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value 
this assessment is performed by comparing the market value of the company s outstanding common stock with the carrying amount of the company s net assets 
if the market value exceeds the carrying amount of the company s net assets  impairment of goodwill does not exist 
if the market value is less than the carrying amount of the company s net assets  the company will perform further analysis and may be required to record an impairment 
the analysis performed at the end of fiscal year revealed no impairment of goodwill 
the company evaluates all of its long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of the company s assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and the impairment will be recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
research and product development costs software development costs are included in research and product development and are expensed as incurred 
historically  the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of the company s core software products has been short  and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
accordingly  the company has not capitalized any software development costs related to its software product  the retrievalware product suite 
the company s new excalibur web product encountered a longer period between technological feasibility and the attainment of commercial availability and  as a result  the company began capitalizing software development costs related to excalibur during the first quarter of fiscal year and continued to do so until such time as commercial availability was determined 
capitalization of software development costs associated with excalibur ceased and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs for this offering commenced on november  and was to continue over a twenty four month period 
during the quarter ended october   management made the determination that due to the lack of revenues generated to date and the loss of a significant potential contract that the asset group related to its excalibur web product may be impaired 
the company analyzed the recoverability of the capitalized software development as required by sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this analysis concluded that the estimated future gross revenues  as reduced by the costs associated with generating such revenues  were insufficient to recover the capitalized cost and  accordingly the company recognized an impairment charge on those capitalized costs of million  equal to the unamortized balance of the related capitalized research and development costs 
for further information related to impairment charges see note impaiment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as discovery achieved technological feasibility in the third quarter of fiscal  as a derivative product of excalibur  the development costs that would otherwise be capitalized under sfas no 
were impaired  and accordingly  have been expensed as incurred

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no

should events indicate that any of the company s assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and the impairment will be recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
during the quarter ended october   the company determined that certain assets used to host its trueknowledge for web product were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended october  for further information related to impairment charges see note impaiment of long lived asset in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
deferred taxes convera records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of projected future taxable income

in january  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method under accounting principal board opinion no 
apb accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the company uses the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r which is consistent with that used for pro forma disclosures under sfas accounting for stock based compensation 
the company has elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r 
the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include the impact of the adoption of sfas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new grants and to the unvested portion of grants that were outstanding and unvested and ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered beginning on february   the first day of the company s fiscal year stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to february  is based on the grant date fair value as determined under the pro forma provisions of sfas prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company measured compensation expense for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic method prescribed by apb no 
the company applied the disclosure provisions of sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
under apb no 
 when the exercise price of the company s stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
nonvested shares of stock referred to as deferred stock granted under the company s stock option plan are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company s common stock 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the corresponding service period 
if an employee leaves the company prior to the vesting of the deferred stock  the estimate of compensation expense recorded in previous periods is adjusted by decreasing compensation expense in the period of forfeiture
