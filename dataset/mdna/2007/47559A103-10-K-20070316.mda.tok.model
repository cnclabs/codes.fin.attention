general the parent company is a bank holding company founded in and headquartered in jeffersonville  new york 
the parent company owns of the outstanding shares of the bank s common stock and derives substantially all of its income from the bank s operations in the form of dividends paid to the parent company 
the bank is a new york commercial bank chartered in serving sullivan county  new york with branch offices in jeffersonville  eldred  liberty  loch sheldrake  monticello two  livingston manor  narrowsburg  callicoon and wurtsboro 
the bank s administrative offices are located in jeffersonville  new york 
the company s mission is to serve the community banking needs of its borrowers and depositors  who predominantly are individuals  small businesses and local municipal governments 
the company believes it understands its local customer needs and provides quality service with a personal touch 
the financial results of the company are influenced by economic events that affect the communities we serve as well as national economic trends  primarily interest rates  affecting the entire banking industry 
changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on the company s net income 
national economic policies have caused interest rates to rise times since june the company s yields on interest earning assets have fallen and the costs of interest bearing liabilities have risen  creating net interest margin compression 
locally  the economy began to weaken in while the local economic forecast has slowed somewhat  it should be acknowledged that the economy in most other areas of new york state continues to be less robust 
significant improvement in the local economy continues to be demonstrated in the sullivan county real estate market 
several new housing projects continued to progress along 
a permanent concert facility has opened on the original site of the woodstock festival in bethel this year 
several native american run casinos are still on the horizon 
however  real estate values have stabilized since the success of these projects  tourism  real estate values and the availability of qualified labor is critical to the local economy and the company 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management

the following schedule sets forth  for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the dollar amount of interest income calculated on a tax equivalent basis and interest expense  and changes therein for as compared to  and as compared to the increase and decrease in interest income and expense due to both rate and volume have been allocated to the two categories of variances volume and rate based on percentage relationships of such variance to each other 
volume and rate analysis compared to compared to increase decrease increase decrease due to change in due to change in volume rate total volume rate total interest income investment securities and securities available for sale short term investments loans total interest income interest expense now and super now deposits savings and insured money market deposits time deposits federal funds purchased and other short term debt long term debt total interest expense net interest income the company s operating results are affected by inflation to the extent that interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels adjust to inflation and impact net interest income 
management can best counter the effect of inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objectives of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
this means that prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact that alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earning ands the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loan and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and general market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from an instantaneous shift in all market interest rates 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december  under instantaneous shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table dollars in thousands projected change in net interest projected projected income as a projected dollar percentage percent of annualized change in change in total interest rate net interest net interest net interest stockholders shock prime rate income income income equity no change under an instantaneous interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at once 
this is a very conservative modeling technique that illustrates immediate rather than gradual increases or decreases in interest rates 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the asset and liability committee and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by  or of total stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock and decline by  million or of stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or instantaneous interest rate shock to of the company s total net interest income 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
generally we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities  so that we can adjust it and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
the bank purchases investments for the securities portfolio and borrowings from the fhlb of ny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
the bank also offers adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of the bank s assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans
