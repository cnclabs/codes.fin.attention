item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are developing novel  proprietary products for the treatment of acute and intermittent conditions 
our technology  the staccato system  enables the precise delivery and rapid onset of therapeutic effect of many small molecule drugs 
our lead product candidates consist of the following az for acute migraine headaches is prochlorperazine incorporated in a chemically heated  single dose staccato device 
we completed enrollment of a phase iib clinical trial for treatment of migraine headaches in december we announced the initial results of this trail in march az for treatment of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia is loxapine incorporated in a chemically heated  single dose staccato device 
we completed enrollment of a phase iia clinical trial of az for treatment of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia in january we announced initial results of this trail in march az for acute treatment of panic attacks associated with panic disorder is alprazolam incorporated in a chemically heated  single dose staccato device 
we initiated a phase iia clinical trial of az for acute treatment of panic attacks in april az for acute pain is fentanyl incorporated in an electrically heated  multiple dose staccato device 
we completed a phase i clinical trial of az in december we were incorporated december  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  capital lease and equipment financings and government grants 
we have generated million in revenue from inception through december   substantially all of which was earned through united states small business innovation research grants 
we do not expect any grant revenues in or material product revenue until at least from inception through  we focused on the development of our technology  the selection and preclinical testing of product candidates and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies 
in  we expanded our activities to include the clinical development of our product candidates 
the continued development of our product candidates 
table of contents will require significant additional expenditures  including expenses for preclinical studies  clinical trials  research and development  manufacturing development and seeking regulatory approvals 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials  and we expect these expenditures to increase in future years as we continue development of our product candidates 
in  we intend to continue our on going clinical trials for az  initiate new clinical trials for az and az  and file at least one ind and initiate a phase i trial for a new product candidate 
these clinical trails will result in higher expenditures than in previous years 
if these product candidates continue to progress  expenses for future phase iii clinical trials will be significantly higher than those incurred in phase ii clinical trials 
we plan no additional clinical development of az during  unless we are able to secure a corporate partner to support continued clinical and device development 
in august we executed a lease for a new facility in mountain view  california 
in  we intend to build a current good manufacturing practice pilot manufacturing facility in this new location and plan to move our operations to the mountain view facility by the end of we intend the pilot manufacturing facility to be capable of manufacturing materials for toxicology studies and clinical trial materials for future clinical trials 
facility lease expenses will increase substantially in and the first quarter of  as we incur rent expense on the mountain view facility while it is under construction in and our current facilities in palo alto  california during and decommissioning in the first quarter of in addition  we will incur significant expense in moving our operations  including our laboratories and manufacturing operations  from our existing premises to the new facility 
on december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements providing for the financing of additional clinical and nonclinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az  staccato loxapine 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony capital llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of symphony holdings llc  and its investors have invested million to form symphony allegro  inc  or symphony allegro  to fund additional clinical and nonclinical development of staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we have exclusively licensed to symphony allegro certain intellectual property rights related to staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we have retained manufacturing rights to these two product candidates 
we continue to be primarily responsible for the development of these two product candidates in accordance with a development plan and related development budgets 
pursuant to the agreements  we have received an exclusive purchase option that gives us the right  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the equity of symphony allegro  and reacquire the intellectual property rights that we licensed to symphony allegro 
this purchase option is exercisable at predetermined prices between december  and december   subject to an earlier exercise right in limited circumstances 
the purchase option exercise price may be paid for in cash or in a combination of cash and our common stock  in our sole discretion  provided that the common stock portion may not exceed of the purchase option exercise price or of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the purchase option closing date 
if we pay a portion of the purchase option exercise price in shares of our common stock  then we will be required to register such shares for resale under a resale registration statement pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement 
if we do not exercise our purchase option by december   then symphony allegro will retain its exclusive license to develop and commercialize staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine for all indications  and we will manufacture and sell staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine to symphony allegro or its sublicensee for those purposes 
as our activities have expanded  we have consistently increased the number of our employees 
we expect that we will add a significant number of employees during the remainder of to support our expanded operations 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during development stage was million and total stockholders equity was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we expect our net losses to increase as we continue our existing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials  expand our research and development efforts and our manufacturing development  move to our new facility  and continue to add the necessary infrastructure to support operating as a public company 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the development of our product candidates to be crucial to our long term success 
if 
table of contents we do not complete development of our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of these product candidates  we may be forced to cease operations 
the probability of success for each product candidate may be impacted by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  device development  manufacturing capability  regulatory approval and commercial viability 
our strategy includes entering into strategic partnerships with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates  such as our symphony allegro relationship 
if third parties have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates  the progress of such product candidate will not be under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to any future partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing az  az and az  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we anticipate developing additional product candidates  which will also increase our research and development expenses in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
we expect the existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities along with the interest earned thereon  funding available from symphony allegro and funds received from option exercises and purchases of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through at least the end of the first quarter of we will need to raise additional capital to support continued development of our product candidates thereafter 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant estimates and judgments in preparation of our financial statements 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and 
table of contents fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study and clinical trial costs based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research institutions and organizations 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial costs 
we make good faith estimates which we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risk and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
if any of our product candidates enter phase iii clinical trials  the process of estimating clinical trial costs will become more difficult because the trials will involve larger numbers of patients and clinical sites 
stock based compensation employee equity incentive awards issued on or subsequent to january  on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
as required  we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method 
under this transition method  beginning january   compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  related to i employees  based on the intrinsic value in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and ii non employees based on the options fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit 
our current estimate assumes no dividends will be paid prior to the vesting of the restricted stock unit 
we estimate the expected term of options using the simplified method  as illustrated in sab as we have been operating as a public company for a period of time that is significantly shorter than our estimated expected option term  we are unable to use actual price volatility data 
therefore  we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on volatility of similar entities 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
employee equity incentive awards issued prior to january  prior to january   we used the intrinsic value recognition method for equity incentive awards issued to employees in accordance with apb during the year ended december   we granted options to employees to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations from an unrelated valuation specialist during this period 
instead  we relied on our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are non employee directors  to determine a reasonable estimate of the then current value of our common stock 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock during  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors 
our board of directors estimated fair value of our common stock as follows in april at per share primarily based on the continuing clinical development of our product candidates 
at this time we had completed our phase i clinical trial and had initiated our phase iia clinical trial of az  our preclinical studies of az and az had progressed  and we had a pre ind meeting with the fda with respect to az  in october at per share upon receipt of the results of our phase iia clinical trial of az and phase i clinical trial of az  which are described in the section entitled business in this prospectus 
these results were sufficiently encouraging for us to consider undertaking the steps necessary to initiate our initial public offering  and in december at per share in light of the results of our phase i clinical trial of az and the anticipated filing of a registration statement in connection with our initial public offering  which occurred on december  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements in connection with our initial public offering in march  we reassessed the estimated fair value of our common stock in light of the expected completion of the offering 
in reassessing the fair value of our common stock during for purposes of computing the stock based compensation expense  we reassessed the fair value of the common stock assuming the successful completion of our initial public offering and then determined the reassessed fair value at previous points in time 
in determining the reassessed fair value of our common stock during  we established as the reassessed fair value at december  of the midpoint of the estimated price range of the initial public offering and applied it over the prior month period using a straight line basis 
we also considered other material factors in reassessing fair value for financial reporting purposes as of the respective option grant dates  including the completion of our phase i clinical trial of az in september  the completion of our phase i clinical trial of az in november  the results of our phase iia clinical trial of az  valuations of existing comparable publicly traded companies  the state of the public offering market for development stage life sciences companies and our decision to pursue an initial public offering 
we believe this approach was consistent with valuation methodologies applied by other life science companies pursuing an initial public offering 
the reassessed fair value used to compute the stock based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods  including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes 
based upon the reassessment discussed above  we determined that the reassessed fair value of the options to purchase  shares of common stock ranged from to per share during the year ended december  we took into account the factors identified above in determining the reassessed fair value of the common stock as of each grant date 
share based compensation resulting from this reassessment equals the difference 
table of contents between the reassessed fair value per share of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price per share and is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
as a result of the reassessed fair value of options granted  we recorded deferred stock based compensation relative to these options of approximately million during the year ended december   which is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options on a straight line basis 
during the years ended december  and  we amortized  and  respectively  of deferred stock based compensation 
at december  we have million of deferred stock compensation to be amortized in future periods as follows  in   in and  in in addition  we had three officer stock option grants that were subject to variable accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with the variable options  we measured the additional compensation each period based on the incremental difference between the reassessed fair value of the shares and the exercise price of the stock options and recorded compensation expense on a graded vesting basis in accordance with fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
as a result of the reassessed fair value  we recorded  of stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  as a result of changes in the our stock price  we recorded a  reduction in compensation expense during the first quarter of as the exercise price was fixed in march  the contingency was resolved and variable accounting for these options ceased 
in december  we extinguished the housing loans that were made to the three officers having a total principal value of million and we agreed to pay million of taxes related to the extinguishment on the officers behalf 
we recognized compensation expense of million in the quarter ended december  as a result of the extinguishments of the officers notes and related taxes 
in connection with the loan extinguishment agreements  we settled the loan extinguishment by reducing the aggregate intrinsic value of their stock options as described below 
as a result  variable stock based compensation expense was reduced by an amount equal to the million loan extinguishment and related taxes in the quarter ended december  in settlement for the extinguishment of the officer notes receivable  we increased the exercise price of certain options to purchase common stock held by these officers such that the aggregate intrinsic value of their stock option awards was reduced by an amount equal to the amounts of the loans extinguished and related taxes paid on their behalf 
we settled this transaction based on the initial public offering price of per share 
non employee equity incentive awards we account for stock compensation arrangements with non employees in accordance  with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we make assumptions with respect to the expected life of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
we have to date assumed that non employee stock options have an expected life of six to ten years  representing their full contractual life  and assumed common stock volatility of 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
share based compensation expense is recognized over the period of expected service by the non employee 
as the service is performed  we are required to update these assumptions and periodically revalue unvested options and make adjustments to the stock based compensation expense using the new valuation 
these adjustments may result in additional or less stock based compensation expense than originally estimated or recorded  with a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense in the statement of operations 
ultimately  the final compensation charge for each option grant to non employees is unknown until those options have vested or services have been completed or the performance of services is completed 
stock based compensation expense associated with these non employee options was   and  for  and  respectively

our revenue for and was million and million  respectively 
in  we recognized approximately million of government grant revenue and  of revenue from drug compound feasibility screening 
in  we recognized approximately million of government grant revenue and  of revenue from drug compound feasibility screening 
the decrease of million of government grant revenue was due to the expiration of existing government grants 
we do not expect additional grant revenue in  as we place greater emphasis on strategic partnerships and allocate fewer resources to obtaining grants 
we do not expect to generate significant  if any  revenues from drug compound feasibility screening in future periods 
operating expenses share based compensation expenses had varying degrees of impact on our comparative operating expenses for the years ended december   and our operating expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands year ended december  non share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative total non share based compensation expenses share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative total share based compensation expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing development efforts 
all research and development costs  including those funded by third parties  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigational sites where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party supplier  consultant and employee related expenses  which include salary and benefits  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies  and in and  certain incremental charges related to officer loan extinguishments and non cash stock based compensation expense

research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to increased spending on clinical trials for az and az product candidates  additional spending on new preclinical programs  increased staffing and other personnel related costs to support our preclinical studies and clinical trials and additional internal research efforts and increased share based compensation expense 
based on our internal records and estimated allocation of employee time and related expenses  our research and development expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials increased to million in from million in research and development expenses represented of total operating expenses for and of total operating expenses for we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development to support the continued development of our product candidates and core technology  expand our research and development efforts and expand our manufacturing development

we expect that research and development expenses for clinical trials will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we conduct additional and later stage clinical trials for our product candidates 
in addition  we expect to incur additional non cash stock based compensation expense in due to the adoption of sfas r in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility and information technology costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent related costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
in  we also incurred certain incremental charges resulting from the extinguishment of officer notes 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in expenses in include million related to the extinguishment of the officer notes and related taxes paid on behalf of the officers 
excluding this expense  general and administrative expenses increased million which was primarily due to expanding legal and accounting staff  adding infrastructure and incurring additional costs related to operating as a public company  including directors and officers insurance  investor relations programs  increased director fees  increased professional fees and non cash stock based compensation expense

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from approximately million in the increases were primarily due to increases in spending on our az product candidate as we prepared for and initiated a phase iib clinical trial in  our az product candidate as we prepared for the initiation of a phase iia clinical trial in the third quarter of  and preclinical efforts on additional potential product candidates 
spending on our az product candidate decreased in as compared to as we incurred higher expenses in for the preparation and initiation of the phase i clinical trial completed in september also  spending on our az product candidate decreased in as compared to as we incurred higher costs in as a result of our efforts to file an ind with the fda which occurred in february and our manufacture of clinical trial material

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin provides measurement and recognition guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold for tax positions 
fin also requires extensive disclosures about uncertainties in the income tax positions taken 
we will adopt fin  as required on january  we have not performed the calculations related to this implementation and therefore the impact of fin on its financial statements is unknown at this time 
on june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error correction  which replaces apb  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas on january  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and do not believe the impact of the adoption will be material 
off balance sheet arrangements none item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents  which have maturities of less than three months  and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and investments held by symphony allegro of million 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a material negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates
