we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts  nike owned retail  including stores and e commerce  and independent distributors and licensees in the united states and worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories 
through this diverse portfolio of brands  our strategy is to create long term revenue growth by connecting with consumers across geographies

table of contents increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 
in fiscal  we met the majority of these financial goals 
our revenues grew to billion  net income grew to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  an increase versus fiscal these reported results included a million pre tax charge  related to stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment fas r  which we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal see note summary of significant accounting policies and note common stock in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the adoption of fas r  and the effects of the converse arbitration ruling in fiscal and subsequent settlement in fiscal excluding these items  our net income grew and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  a increase versus fiscal see reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the converse arbitration and stock based compensation expense below 
fiscal results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of percentage points as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the european tax agreement the company finalized in the second quarter of fiscal for the year  the increase in net income was below our rate of revenue growth due to higher selling and administrative expenses versus the same period in the prior year 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to the adoption of fas r and higher investments in growth drivers such as demand creation and operating overhead 
our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program 
in addition  we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases 
our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal as a result of the adoption of fas r 
although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year  we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals

fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage declined basis points versus the prior year 
the primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal were as follows lower footwear in line net pricing margins in the us  emea and asia pacific regions 
the lower footwear in line net pricing margins were due to higher product costs  primarily the result of higher oil prices  additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand in the us  higher sales incentives in emea and asia pacific  strategies to improve consumer value in emea and japan  and a shift in the mix of footwear models sold towards models with lower margins within emea and japan 
a shift in the mix of revenues reported from our operating segments towards regions and subsidiaries with lower margins

for fiscal  other income expense  net was primarily comprised of the million gain on the sale leaseback of our oregon footwear distribution center and the million benefit from the settlement of the converse arbitration  offset by foreign currency hedge losses 
the foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal primarily reflect the strengthening of the euro since we entered into these hedge contracts 
the change in other income expense  net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal  which were more than offset by the converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our oregon footwear distribution center discussed above  compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal  which were more than offset by the million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the converse arbitration 
foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other income expense  net are reflected in the corporate line  the gain on the sale of the oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the us region line  and the converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the other line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the notes to consolidated financial statements note operating segments and related information 
in fiscal  the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits  most notably in the emea region 
we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other income expense  net  and the favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal compared to the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal the significant reduction in other income expense  net for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year  partially offset by the converse arbitration charge

these benefits included the year european tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal  which is effective for fiscal years through this agreement  which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  our ceo and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the american jobs creation act of the act to repatriate million of foreign earnings in fiscal the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
a million repatriation was made during the quarter ended may  comprised of both foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested 
accordingly  the provisions made did not have a material impact on the company s income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year 
futures orders worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were nearly higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period  which approximate current spot rates 
the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately percentage point to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year 
excluding this currency impact  unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders 
the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders  and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders  including at once and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel  wholesale sales of equipment  cole haan  converse  exeter brands group  hurley  nike bauer hockey  nike golf and retail sales across all brands

if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may   we would be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination fee of million 
our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate million 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below

capital resources in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec under which billion in debt securities may be issued 
in may  we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to million in medium term notes  as our capital needs dictate 
we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the medium term note program we have issued million in medium term notes 

table of contents during fiscal  no medium term notes were issued under the program 
we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
during fiscal  one of the company s japanese subsidiaries entered into a billion yen approximately million as of may  loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings 
the interest rate on the facility is based on the six month japanese yen london interbank offer rate libor plus a spread  resulting in an all in rate of at may  the facility expires on december  unless both parties agree to an extension 
during fiscal  the company s same japanese subsidiary entered into a billion yen approximately million as of may  term loan that replaces certain intercompany borrowings and matures on february  the interest rate on the loan is approximately and interest is paid semi annually 
as of may   we had a multi year billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks  and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility 
the facility matures in december  and can be extended for one additional year on both the first and second anniversary date 
based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 
the facility fee is of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility 
under this committed credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  and set a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program  under which there was no amount outstanding at may  or may  we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
we currently believe that cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future

 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of fas are effective for the fiscal year beginning june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fas in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the provisions of fas are effective for the fiscal year beginning june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fas critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since 
table of contents our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

table of contents contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded within other income expense  net 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by fas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates 
table of contents may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite lived intangible assets would be classified within other income expense  net 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
any significant impairment charges would be classified within other income expense  net 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted fas  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
stock based compensation as of the first quarter of fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fas r 
under the provisions of fas r  the fair value of stock based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility 
expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year  along with other factors 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

table of contents in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other income expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

table of contents we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
when we begin hedging exposures  the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european subsidiary 
we use forward contracts to hedge non functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollars and mexican pesos 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the decrease in var as of may  occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of may  compared to may  such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being 
table of contents hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below  except the interest rate swaps which are described below 
these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk euro functional currency intercompany loan us dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan british pound denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency intercompany loan japanese yen denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan canadian dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation 
intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties  as discussed above 
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary 
there were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal we did not issue any long term fixed rate corporate bonds during fiscal or  however  in previous years we issued a total of million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds that mature between july and october fixed interest 
table of contents rates on these bonds range from to 
for each of the bonds issued  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month libor plus a spread 
as a result of the interest rate swap agreements  the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was at may  and at may  for million of the issued bonds  the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond 
these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges  so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt 
the remaining million bond matures in october  whereas the associated interest rate swap expired in october accordingly  changes in the fair value of this swap were recorded in net income each period 
the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net loss of million and million at may  and may   respectively  and a million gain at may  the change in fair value of the million interest rate swap that expired in october was not material for the years ended may   and in fiscal we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on month libor plus a spread 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at and receives variable interest payments based on month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of billion japanese yen 
this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period 
the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may   and
