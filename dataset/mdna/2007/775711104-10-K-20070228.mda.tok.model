the previous presentation reconciles reported net revenues us gaap amounts to revenue excluding the industrial fumigant company for the years ended december  and the non gaap information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under us gaap

following the plaintiffs motion for rehearing  the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class 
orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the plaintiffs to do so 
in ernest w 
warren and dolores g 
warren et al 
v 
orkin exterminating company  inc  et al  pending in the superior court of cobb county  marietta  georgia  the court ruled in august certifying the class action against orkin 
orkin has appealed this ruling to the georgia court of appeals 
other lawsuits against orkin  and in some instances the company  are also being vigorously defended  including the petsch case 
for further discussion  see note to the accompanying financial statements 
the company is currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs for tax years and the irs has issued notices of proposed adjustment with respect to various issues 
the company is currently reviewing its position regarding the adjustments and plans to defend against those adjustments that are without merit 
the company does not expect the resolution of these issues  taken individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company made a contribution of million to its defined benefit retirement plan the plan during and as a result of the plan s funding status 
the company believes that it will make contributions in the amount of approximately million in in the opinion of management  additional plan contributions will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than the operating leases disclosed in the table below  the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
the impact that the company s contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years non compete agreements non cancelable operating leases    capital leases acquisition notes payable total      minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined 
the company estimates that it will contribute approximately million to the plan in fiscal critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repairs and associated labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs relative to termite control services 
factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company s business practices 
however  it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims 
positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts  more effective treatment methods that include a directed liquid and baiting program  more effective termiticides  and expanding training 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management s knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data  actual developments may vary from the company s projections 
this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment 
therefore  changes in estimates may be material 
management s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management s knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
it should be noted that the number of claims has been decreasing due to the company s proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs 
initiatives that have been implemented include pre employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers  utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully deployed to company vehicles  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi monthly basis  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting 
at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation  the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services 
the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service 
the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
prior to  traditional termite treatments were recognized as revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was established for estimated costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred 
under the accounting method adopted in  the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  and  the cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred 
for outstanding claims  an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information 
the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and  while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts  these costs are incurred over the contract term 
the accounting principle adopted in eliminates the need to obtain actuarial estimates of the claim costs to be incurred and management s estimates of reapplication costs 
also  management believes the newly adopted this accounting method more closely conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred  and conforms to the accounting methodology of orkin and its subsidiary  western pest services 
the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 
due to this change  in the company recorded a cumulative adjustment to reduce net income by million net of income taxes 
as the revenue is being deferred  the future cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued 
the company will continue to accrue for noticed claims 
contingency accruals the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation 
estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel 
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation 
however  in the opinion of management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date  which is generally the date of the grant 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas r on january  details related to the adoption of sfas r and the impact to the company s financial statements are more fully discussed in note employee benefit and stock compensation plans

  and r 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans as an asset or a liability in its statement of financial position 
the funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation for other post retirement benefit plans 
an employer is also required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income 
sfas also requires certain disclosures regarding the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and the transition asset or obligation

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
the effects of prior year uncorrected errors include the potential accumulation of improper amounts that may result in a material misstatement on the balance sheet or the reversal of prior period errors in the current period that result in a material misstatement of the current period income statement amounts 
adjustments to current or prior period financial statements would be required in the event that after application of various approaches for assessing materiality of a misstatement in current period financial statements and consideration of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  a misstatement is determined to be material
