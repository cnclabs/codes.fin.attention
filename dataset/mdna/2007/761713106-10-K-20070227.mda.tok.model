following the overview and discussion of business initiatives  the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to rai s results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented in this report 
the discussion and analysis of rai s results of operations is presented in two comparative sections  compared with  and compared with disclosures related to liquidity and financial condition complete management s discussion and analysis 
you should read this discussion and analysis of rai s consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of december  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  overview and business initiatives rai s operating subsidiaries include rjr tobacco  conwood  santa fe  lane and gpi 
rai s largest reportable operating segment  rjr tobacco  is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states 
rjr tobacco s largest selling cigarette brands  camel  kool  doral  winston and salem  are currently five of the ten best selling brands of cigarettes in the united states 
those brands  and its other brands  including pall mall  misty and capri  are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the united states to meet a range of adult smoker preferences 
rjr tobacco also manages a contract manufacturing business through arrangements with bat affiliates 
rai s other reportable operating segment  conwood  is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the united states 
rai acquired conwood on may  conwood s primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands  grizzly and kodiak  two of the six best selling brands of moist snuff in the united states  and levi garrett  a loose leaf brand 
conwood s other products include dry snuff  plug and twist tobacco products 
all of conwood s products held the first or second position in market share in their respective categories in the disclosures classified as all other include the total assets and results of operations of santa fe  lane and gpi 
santa fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the natural american spirit brand 
santa fe markets its products primarily in the united states  and has a small  but growing  international tobacco business 
lane manufactures or distributes cigars  roll your own  cigarette and pipe tobacco brands  including dunhill and captain black tobacco products 
gpi manufactures and exports cigarettes to us territories  us duty free shops and us overseas military bases  and manages a contract manufacturing business 
beginning on january   conwood will distribute certain of lane s non cigarette products  and rjr tobacco will distribute dunhill cigarettes 
also  beginning on january   gpi will manage santa fe s international business 
rjr tobacco rjr tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive us cigarette market with a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is believed to be a mature market  and overall consumer demand is expected to continue to decline 
trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for its products if  and when  wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their 
table of contents purchases of product to manage their inventory levels 
rjr tobacco believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on other external factors that may impact the purchasing decisions of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors 
competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price  as well as product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence 
cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing  substantial marketing support  retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve a brand s market position or to introduce a new brand 
rjr tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands 
rjr tobacco s marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image  build brand awareness and loyalty and switch adult smokers of competing brands 
in addition to building strong brand equity  rjr tobacco s marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy  including discounting at retail  to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure 
competitive discounting has increased significantly over time as a result of higher state excise taxes and the strength of deep discount brands 
deep discount brands are brands marketed by manufacturers that are not original participants in the msa  and accordingly  do not have cost structures burdened with msa payments to the same extent as the original participating manufacturers 
rjr tobacco s brand portfolio strategy during and included three categories of brands investment  selective support and non support 
the investment brands were camel and kool  which received significant resources focused on accelerating their share of market growth 
the selective support brands included two premium brands  winston and salem  and two value brands  doral and pall mall  all of which received limited support in an effort to optimize profitability 
the non support brands were managed to maximize near term profitability 
at the beginning of  rjr tobacco further refined its brand portfolio strategy and modified the three categories of brands to growth  support and non support 
the growth brands include two premium brands  camel and kool  and a value brand  pall mall 
although all of these brands are managed for long term accelerated growth and profit  camel and kool will continue to receive significant investment support  consistent with their previous investment brand status 
the support brands include three premium brands  winston  salem and capri  and two value brands  doral and misty  all of which receive limited support for scale and long term profit 
the non support brands include all remaining brands and are managed to maximize near term profitability 
rjr tobacco expects that  within the next four years  this focused portfolio strategy will result in growth in total rjr tobacco share  as gains on growth brands more than offset declines among other brands 
conwood on may   rai  through its newly formed subsidiary  conwood holdings  inc  completed its billion acquisition of of the capital stock of a newly formed holding company owning conwood company  lp  conwood sales co  lp  rosswil llc  scott tobacco llc  conwood llc  conwood llc and conwood llc 
conwood is engaged in the business of developing  manufacturing and marketing smokeless tobacco products 
conwood s headquarters and primary manufacturing facility are located in memphis  tennessee 
the conwood acquisition was funded by rai borrowings  new debt rai securities and available cash 
see liquidity below for additional information relating to borrowing arrangements and long term debt 
the transaction was treated as a purchase of the conwood net assets by rai for financial accounting purposes 
rai believes the conwood acquisition will enhance shareholder value and will continue to be accretive to operating earnings 
the conwood acquisition also is expected to enhance rai s efforts to offer a range of differentiated tobacco products to adult consumers 
rai intends to combine certain operations of lane with conwood  to be completed by the end of  in order to consolidate and strengthen the companies portfolio of smokeless tobacco products and other non cigarette tobacco products 
conwood is the only company with brands in every category of the smokeless tobacco market  including moist snuff  loose leaf  dry snuff  plug and twist tobacco 
conwood s moist snuff products accounted for approximately of its total net sales in in contrast to the declining us cigarette market  us moist snuff volumes have grown at an average rate of approximately per year over the last four years with an accelerated growth of price value brands 
also  the profit 
table of contents margins on moist snuff are significantly higher than in the cigarette industry 
moist snuff s growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both 
within the moist snuff category  premium brands have lost market share to price value brands  led by grizzly  in recent years 
conwood s us moist snuff market share was for the year ended december   based on distributor reported data processed by msai  for distributor shipments to retail 
conwood has more than doubled its total share in the past six years 
conwood s continued growth is attributable to its innovation  product development and brand building  including the launch of the grizzly moist snuff brand in which  for  had a market share 
conwood faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories 
similar to the cigarette market  competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price  as well as product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence 
critical accounting policies and estimates gaap requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in rai s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations  financial condition and results of operations of rai and its subsidiaries 
for information related to these and other significant accounting policies  see note to consolidated financial statements 
purchase accounting rai accounts for business combination transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that rai allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
estimates of fair values for property  plant and equipment  trademarks and other identifiable intangibles generally are based on independent appraisals  pension and postretirement obligations are based on actuarial studies  and other accounts are based on management s best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
in addition  depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of trademarks and other intangibles with finite lives  are directly related to estimated fair values and estimated useful lives determined as of the acquisition date 
the determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment 
among other things  it requires developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for trademarks and other intangibles  selecting appropriate valuation bases and methodologies for property  plant and equipment  determining appropriate actuarial assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans  and determining the number and timing of employees to be terminated or relocated and the associated costs 
the value of goodwill and trademarks and other intangibles with indefinite lives will be subjected to annual impairment testing that could result in future impairment charges 
changes in the useful lives of property  plant and equipment  trademarks or other intangibles could impact depreciation or  in certain situations  impairment charges 
tobacco related litigation rai discloses information concerning tobacco related litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote 
rai and its subsidiaries record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
rai and its subsidiaries will record any loss related to tobacco litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount of the range will be recorded 
as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr tobacco  conwood and their affiliates  including rai  and indemnitees  have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or 
table of contents claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars 
unfavorable judgments awarding compensatory damages  punitive damages and or fines have been returned against rjr tobacco in the engle case  the scott class action case  a small number of individual smoking and health cases  a broin ii flight attendant ets case and a california state law enforcement action 
the july engle punitive damages verdict was reversed by the intermediate appellate court on may   and the reversal was upheld by the florida supreme court on july  rjr tobacco has paid approximately million since january   related to unfavorable smoking and health judgments  including pre acquisition contingencies related to the b w business combination 
rai and its subsidiaries believe  however  that they have valid bases for appeals in their pending cases  and believe they have a number of valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously 
rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees  including b w  or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against conwood  when viewed on an individual basis  is not probable or estimable 
rjr tobacco recorded less than million related to the judgment in the thompson v 
b w individual case in the fourth quarter of  to be paid in no other liability for smoking and health tobacco litigation or smokeless tobacco litigation was recorded in rai s consolidated balance sheet as of december  as discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr has liabilities totaling million that were recorded in in connection with certain indemnification claims  not related to smoking and health  asserted by jti against rjr and rjr tobacco  relating to the activities of northern brands and related litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against rjr tobacco  conwood or their affiliates  including rai  and indemnitees 
any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of rai or its subsidiaries 
settlement agreements as discussed in litigation affecting the cigarette industry in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr tobacco  santa fe and lane are participants in the msa  and rjr tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions 
their obligations and the related expense charges under the msa and other state settlement agreements are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries  their relative market share and inflation 
since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped 
adjustments to these estimates  which historically have not been significant  are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
conwood is not a participant in the msa 
for more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the msa and other state settlement agreements  see governmental health care cost recovery cases msa and other state settlement agreements in note to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles and are accounted for under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges in connection with rai s ongoing application of sfas no 
rai generally engages an independent appraisal firm to assist it in determining the fair value of its reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment 
in particular  the fair value of a reporting unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows  determining an appropriate discount rate  and when goodwill impairment is implied  determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities  including unrecorded intangibles 
although rai believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
generally  if the current competitive environment worsens or rai s operating companies strategic initiatives adversely affect 
table of contents their financial performance  the fair value of goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles could be impaired in future periods 
pension and postretirement benefits rai and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees  and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents 
these benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after january  for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits  see note to consolidated financial statements

 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
all previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss  unrecognized prior service cost  or unrecognized transition obligation or asset existing at the date of the conwood acquisition were eliminated 
as a result of the conwood acquisition  rai s pension benefit obligation and pension assets increased by million and million  respectively  and the postretirement benefit obligation increased by million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

postretirement benefit expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
because pension and other postretirement obligations will ultimately be settled in future periods  the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions 
with the assistance of independent actuarial and investment management firms  rai reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidentally with a major event and modifies them as needed 
demographic assumptions such as termination of employment  mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change 
gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions 
the minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses  as described in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  is included in pension expense 
prior service costs  which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments  are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees 
the market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years 
if the market value of assets had been used to determine pension expense  the impact would have been a decrease to the costs of million 
approximately million is attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense and million is due to the gain loss amortization component 
the minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses  as described in sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  is also included in the postretirement benefit expense 
prior service costs  which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments  are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees  or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees 
the market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset losses of million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years 
if the market value of assets had been used to determine 
table of contents postretirement benefit expense  the impact would have been an increase to the costs of million  all attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense 
the most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below pension benefits postretirement benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december discount rate rate of compensation increase pension benefits postretirement benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended december discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the january  overall beginning discount rate of was changed to for the period from april  to december   for plans impacted by the sale of rjr tobacco s packaging operations

rai generally uses a hypothetical bond matching analysis to determine the discount rate 
the overall expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for pension and postretirement assets are based on the target asset allocation for plan assets  long term capital markets forecasts for asset classes employed and excess return expectations of active management to the extent asset classes are actively managed 

table of contents assumption sensitivity assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans

the cap was raised above previous amounts creating an unrecognized prior service cost of million 
in  rai introduced new retiree medical options and cost sharing for certain retirees creating a prior service credit of million 
the prior service cost will be amortized over the number of years  on average  it takes for employees to be fully eligible for benefits 
pension expense in is expected to be within a range of million expense to million income  compared with expense of million in  primarily due to increased asset returns and employer contributions 
postretirement benefit expense in is expected to be within a range of million to million  compared with expense of million in 
table of contents the amount by which the pension and postretirement benefit obligations exceed the fair value of the plan assets could increase to the extent of a decline in the fair value of plan assets  as well as adverse changes in actuarial assumptions  including a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations 
rai expects to contribute approximately million to its pension plans in  of which million was contributed in january additional cash funding may be made in the future 
rai expects payments related to its postretirement plans to be million in differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
in recent years  actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions 
in particular  pension and postretirement liabilities have decreased as a result of the increase in the discount rate 
these changes have resulted in a reduction in charges to comprehensive income 
these changes are expected to result in a reduction in pension and postretirement expense in future years 
however  the pension protection act passed into law in may require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future

for further discussion of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against rai or its affiliates or indemnitees  see note to consolidated financial statements 
even though rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees  or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against conwood  when viewed on an individual basis  is not probable  the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against rjr tobacco  conwood or their affiliates or indemnitees  or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss 
moreover  notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters  it is possible that rai s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters 
in november  rjr tobacco  b w and the other major us cigarette manufacturers entered into the msa with attorneys general representing most us states  territories and possessions 
as described in note to consolidated financial statements  the msa imposes a stream of future payment obligations on rjr tobacco and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future

the msa and other state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected rjr tobacco s shipment volumes 
rai believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations  cash flows or financial condition of rai and rjr tobacco in future periods 
the degree of the adverse impact will depend  among other things  on the rate of decline in us cigarette sales in the premium and value categories  rjr tobacco s share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories  and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the msa and other state settlement agreements 
the msa includes an adjustment  referred to as an npm adjustment  that potentially reduces rjr tobacco s and other participating manufacturers annual payment obligations 
certain requirements must be satisfied before the npm adjustment  which relates to a specified market year  is available 
in april  rjr tobacco placed million of its msa payment into a disputed payments account  in accordance with a procedure established by the msa 
that amount represented rjr tobacco s share of the npm adjustment as calculated by an independent auditor designated under the msa 
during  proceedings were initiated and prosecuted with respect to an npm adjustment for the independent auditor determined that the participating manufacturers again suffered a market share loss sufficient to trigger an npm adjustment for on april   rjr tobacco and the other cigarette manufacturers initiated the significant factor proceedings called for under the msa 
on february   the independent economic consulting firm retained by the settling states and the cigarette manufacturers issued a final  non 
table of contents appealable determination that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the market share loss 
rjr tobacco is evaluating what action to take in light of this determination 
the settling states contend that rjr tobacco and other participating manufacturers are not entitled to the npm adjustment 
as of february   of the settling states  had filed legal proceedings seeking orders compelling rjr tobacco and the other participating manufacturers that placed money in the disputed payments account to pay such disputed amounts to the settling states 
rjr tobacco intends to defend these proceedings vigorously by  among other things  moving to compel arbitration as provided in the msa 
as of february   courts had addressed whether disputes concerning the npm adjustment are arbitrable  and had ruled that arbitration is required under the msa 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these proceedings 
governmental activity the marketing  sale  taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years 
various state governments have adopted or are considering  among other things  legislation and regulations that would significantly increase their taxes on tobacco products  restrict displays  advertising and sampling of tobacco products  establish ignition propensity standards for cigarettes  raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products  restrict or ban the use of certain flavorings in tobacco products  require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products  require the disclosure of nicotine yield information for cigarettes based on a machine test method different from that required by the us federal trade commission  impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas  and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients  including over the internet 
in addition  during  the us congress will consider regulation of the manufacture and sale of tobacco products by the fda  and also may consider legislation regarding further increases in the federal excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products  regulation of environmental tobacco smoke  additional warnings on tobacco packaging and advertising  reduction or elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising expenses  implementation of a national standard for fire safe cigarettes  regulation of the retail sale of tobacco products over the internet and in other non face to face retail transactions  such as by mail order and telephone  and banning of the delivery of tobacco products by the us postal service 
in february  proposed legislation was introduced in the us house of representatives and the us senate that would give the fda broad regulatory authority over tobacco products 
the proposals would grant the fda authority to impose product standards including standards relating to  among other things  nicotine yields and smoke constituents and would reinstate the fda s proposed legislation that would have restricted marketing 
the proposed legislation also would govern modified risk products and would impose new and larger warning labels on tobacco products 

table of contents together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal taxes on tobacco products  these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products 
cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states 
the federal excise tax per pack of cigarettes is 
all states and the district of columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from per pack in south carolina to per pack in new jersey 
on december   the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack  calculated on a month rolling average basis  was approximately 
four states passed excise tax per pack increases in texas to  effective january   new jersey to  effective july   vermont to on july   and to on july   and hawaii to over six years  in six annual increments of  commencing october  
additionally  ballot initiatives to increase the cigarette excise tax in arizona by per pack and in south dakota by per pack were approved 
certain city and county governments  such as new york and chicago  also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions 
a federal excise tax was first imposed on smokeless tobacco products in and currently is per pound for chewing tobacco  and per pound for snuff 
the federal tax on small cigars  defined as those weighing three pounds or less per thousand  is per thousand 
large cigars are taxed at a rate of of the manufacturer s price  with a cap of per thousand 
forty nine states also subject smokeless tobacco to excise taxes 
as of december   states taxed smokeless tobacco on an ad valorem basis at rates that range from in north carolina to in massachusetts 
california  which adjusts its rate annually in an effort to equalize smokeless tobacco and cigarette taxes  currently imposes a rate of 
in  texas passed legislation that raises its ad valorem excise tax rate to effective january  alabama  arizona  connecticut  montana and north dakota tax moist snuff and in alabama  arizona and north dakota chewing tobacco as well on the bases of weight at rates ranging from for snuff units weighing less than of an ounce in alabama to per ounce of snuff in montana  and per ounce for chewing tobacco in alabama to per ounce in north dakota 
kentucky has a unit tax of per unit on moist snuff 
three states changed the method of taxing moist snuff from an ad valorem basis to a weight based tax during vermont per ounce  rhode island per ounce and new jersey per ounce 
cigars are generally taxed on an ad valorem basis  ranging from in north carolina to in alaska and washington 
alabama  arizona  oklahoma and texas have unit based tax schemes for cigars  while california  connecticut  florida  iowa  tennessee and vermont tax little cigars the same as cigarettes 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania levies no tax on other tobacco products 
on october   the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the us department of treasury  referred to as the ttb  issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  proposing changes to the regulations that govern the classification and labeling of cigars and cigarettes for federal excise tax purposes 
the proposed regulatory changes address concerns regarding the adequacy of current regulatory standards for distinguishing between cigars and cigarettes  with particular reference to the distinction between little cigars and cigarettes 
the distinction between cigars and cigarettes is important for federal tax purposes because the rate of tax varies from one product class to another 
for example  the rate of tax on little cigars weighing not more than three pounds per thousand is per thousand  compared to the rate of tax on cigarettes weighing not more than three pounds per thousand which is per thousand 
it is estimated that at least three fourths of all recognized and established little cigar brands in the united states would be re classified as cigarettes under criteria established under the proposed regulations 
although the captain black and winchester little cigar brands manufactured by lane have been classified and sold as little cigars for more than years and years  respectively  both brands would be re classified as cigarettes under these proposed regulations 
although it is not possible to fully assess and quantify the negative impact of the proposed regulations on the little cigar products of lane  the immediate impact would be to increase the federal excise tax on such products by more than tenfold 
the deadline for submitting written comments to ttb regarding the proposed regulations is march  in  the report of the advisory committee to the surgeon general of the us public health service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial 
table of contents action 
since  federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging 
since  television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the united states 
cigarette advertising in other media in the united states is required to include information with respect to the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes  as well as a warning statement 
during the past four decades  various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted 
in  congress enacted the comprehensive smoking education act 
among other things  this act establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking  requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis  increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements  and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually  on a confidential basis  a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the secretary of health and human services 
the warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy  surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health  surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight  and surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
since the initial report in  the secretary of health  education and welfare now the secretary of health and human services and the surgeon general have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards  including various types of cancer  coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease 
these reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  the federal alcohol  drug abuse and mental health act was signed into law 
this act required states to adopt a minimum age of for purchase of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor  report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs 
in january  the us department of health and human services announced regulations implementing this legislation 
and in june  the surgeon general released a report entitled the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke 
among its conclusions  the report found the following exposure of adults to secondhand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer  exposure of children to secondhand smoke results in an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome  acute respiratory infections  ear problems and more severe asthma  and that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke 
in  congress enacted the comprehensive smokeless tobacco health education act of  which  among other things  required health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising and prohibited the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on any medium of electronic communications subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission 
the warnings currently required on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising  which appear on a rotating basis  are warning this product may cause mouth cancer  warning this product may cause gum disease and tooth loss  and warning this product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes 

table of contents in june  the seven largest us cigar companies  including lane  entered into agreements with the us federal trade commission to clearly and conspicuously display on virtually every cigar package and advertisement one of the following warnings  which appear on a rotating basis surgeon general warning cigar smoking can cause cancers of the mouth and throat  even if you do not inhale  surgeon general warning cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease  surgeon general warning tobacco use increases the risk of infertility  stillbirth and low birth weight  surgeon general warning cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes  and surgeon general warning tobacco smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease  even in nonsmokers 
legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted in states and many local jurisdictions  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
a number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs  health care programs or cancer research 
in addition  educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general 
federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft  and the us interstate commerce commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate 
certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking 
in december  the california environmental protection agency air resources board issued a proposed identification of environmental tobacco smoke as a toxic air contaminant for public review 
on january   the air resources board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a toxic air contaminant  following a three year administrative process 
the air resources board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke 
rjr tobacco cannot predict the form any future california regulation may take 
on december   the new york office of fire prevention and control issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in new york state after june   to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions 
the cigarettes that rai s operating companies sell in new york state comply with this standard 
in  california and vermont  and in  illinois  massachusetts and new hampshire  each enacted fire safe legislation of its own  adopting the same testing standard set forth in the ofpc regulations described above 
this requirement took effect in vermont on may   and will take effect in california on january   in new hampshire on october   and in illinois and massachusetts on january  similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states 
varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of rjr tobacco 
on august   the massachusetts department of public health released a report entitled  change in nicotine yields  based on data submitted by rjr tobacco as well as other cigarette manufacturers pursuant to massachusetts law 
under this law  cigarette manufactures are required to provide nicotine yield data generated under a machine test method different from that required by the ftc for all styles of a cigarette brand family that has a national market share of or more as well as other brand styles selected by the mdph 
other than texas in  no other state has passed similar regulations 
however  massachusetts recent report has generated interest from at least one other state for this type of information 
a price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for us sale 
consequently  a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad  but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that rjr tobacco manufactures for domestic sale 
the us federal government and all states  except massachusetts  have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes 
in addition  rjr tobacco has taken legal action against certain distributors and retailers who engage in such practices 

table of contents rjr tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the msa and nonparticipating manufacturers under the msa  referred to as npms 
forty six states have passed legislation to ensure npms are making required escrow payments 
under this legislation  a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be msa compliant 
failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an npm s ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state 
early efforts to enact legislation  from to early  resulted in a range of npm laws  some containing only minimal requirements 
however  once the national association of attorneys general  referred to as naag  became involved in the legislative initiative  model complementary npm language was developed and introduced in the states where either no npm laws existed or where existing laws needed to be amended to bring them in line with the model language 
additionally  states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the msa 
the loophole allows npms that concentrate their sales in a single state  or a limited number of states  to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts 
to obtain the refunds  the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the msa ie  the state s allocable share 
naag has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole 
following a challenge by npms  the us district court for the southern district of new york has issued an order enjoining new york from enforcing allocable share legislation 
it is possible that npms will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states 
finally  four states  alaska  michigan  minnesota and utah  have enacted equity assessments on npms products 
this legislative initiative has not been endorsed by naag  and one npm has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in michigan 
thirty five states by statute or court rule have limited  and several additional states are considering limiting  the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court 
the limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from million to million 
such bonding statutes allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments  such as cigarette manufacturers  to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process 
in six other jurisdictions  the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court 
on may   the world health organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty 
the treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking  restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing  provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients  increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least of each package and include graphic pictures on packages 
the treaty entered into force on february  days after ratification by the th country 
in february  the first session of the conference of the parties  referred to as the cop  occurred in geneva  switzerland 
the cop  among other actions taken  established a permanent secretariat  adopted a budget  and created working groups to begin to develop protocols on cross border advertising and illegal trade and guidelines on establishing smoke free places and regulating tobacco products 
although the us delegate to the world health organization voted for the treaty in may  and the secretary for health and human services signed the document in may  it is not known whether the treaty will be sent to the us senate for ratification 
ratification of the treaty by the united states could lead to broader regulation of the industry 
it is not possible to determine what additional federal  state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on rjr tobacco or the cigarette industry in general  but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on rjr tobacco or the cigarette industry in general 
similarly  it is not possible to determine what additional federal  state or local legislation or regulations relating to smokeless tobacco products will be enacted or to predict the effect of new regulation on conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general  but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general 
tobacco buyout legislation on october   the president signed the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of  referred to as fetra  eliminating the us government s tobacco production controls and price support program 
the buyout of 
table of contents tobacco quota holders provided for in fetra is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer  on a market share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied 
the aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately billion  including approximately billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock 
as a result of the tobacco buyout legislation  the msa phase ii obligations established in will be continued as scheduled through the end of  but will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations 
rai s operating subsidiaries annual expense under fetra  excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment  is estimated to be approximately million to million 
rai s operating subsidiaries incurred million in related to assessments from quota tobacco stock liquidation 
in the first quarter of  a million favorable adjustment was recorded relating to the tobacco stock liquidation assessment 
remaining contingent liabilities for liquidation of quota tobacco stock  if any  will be recorded when an assessment is made 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to federal tobacco buyout expenses 
rai s operating subsidiaries will record the fetra assessment on a quarterly basis upon required notification of assessments 
rai s operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate billion to billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the msa

such laws and regulations provide for significant fines  penalties and liabilities  sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 
in the past  rjr tobacco has been named a potentially responsible party with third parties under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act with respect to several superfund sites 
rai and its subsidiaries are not aware of any current environmental matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of rai or its subsidiaries 
regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency and other governmental agencies under various statutes have resulted in  and likely will continue to result in  substantial expenditures for pollution control  waste treatment  plant modification and similar activities 
rai and its subsidiaries are engaged in a continuing program to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  and dependent upon the probability of occurrence and reasonable estimation of cost  accrue or disclose any material liability 
although it is difficult to reasonably estimate the portion of capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  rai does not expect such expenditures or other costs to have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of rai or its subsidiaries
