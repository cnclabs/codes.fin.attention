item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies 
the sec defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the company s revenue recognition policy for long term leases with scheduled rent increases leasing segment meets the sec definition of critical 
certain of the company s long term land leases have original terms of to years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date 
the first such lease commenced in  had an original term of years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals as well as reappraisal increases 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
accounting for leases and certain of its interpretations  rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight line basis 
to calculate the annual straight line amount  the known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by for this lease  the calculated annual straight line amount for was eight times multiple the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease the contractual amount 
in subsequent years  as the tenant pays higher rents  the multiple gradually decreases until the th year of the lease  at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight line amount 
if the company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight line amount  it would record a significant receivable for each of the first years  which receivable would grow to approximately  management does not believe that the company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the th year the turnaround date since management could not be assured of collection 
in  management met with the sec accounting staff to discuss its concerns over the provisions of fas no 
as they related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future 
the company presented the sec accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectibility of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible 
the sec accounting staff did not object to this application by the company 
through december   the receivable on this lease has grown to approximately  cumulative excess of straight line over contractual rentals and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still years away 
in  a second such lease commenced with an original term of years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals as well as reappraisal increases 
for this lease  the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight line amount until the th year of the lease 
through december   the receivable on this lease is approximately  cumulative excess of straight line over contractual rentals and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is years away 
in june  the company entered into an amended and restated agreement of its lease with lamar outdoor advertising llc lamar with a current remaining term of years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually 
for this lease  the contractual amount paid by lamar will not exceed the calculated straight line amount until the th year of the lease 
through december   the receivable on this lease is approximately  cumulative excess of straight line over contractual rentals and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is years away 

table of contents accordingly  the company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer 
although the company s other long term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases  the provisions of the leases are such that the future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now  as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known  ie  future cost of living adjustments or future appraised values 
the company is reporting the annual rental revenues under these leases using the contractual amounts in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
the company continues to recognize accrued leasing revenue from two leases which were recorded in prior years 
the audit committee of the board of directors concurs with the company s application of its critical accounting policy relating to leasing revenue under long term land leases 
segments the company operates in two segments  leasing and petroleum storage 
the leasing segment consists of the long term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown providence  rhode island upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon  with the exception of a parking garage  and to pay real property taxes  and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in rhode island and massachusetts to lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon 
the company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the capital center area will consist primarily of long term ground leases 
pending this development  the company leases these parcels for public parking purposes under short term cancellable leasing arrangements 
the petroleum storage segment consists of operating the facility in east providence  rhode island  for global companies  llc global 
the principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations 
the tenants in the leasing segment incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the company s land  whereas the company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenses as well as capital improvements at the facility 
changes in capital structure in december  the company amended its articles of incorporation to create three classes of 
par value stock class a common stock  class b common stock  and excess stock 
the company converted the then outstanding  shares of par value common shares into  shares of class a common stock 
in addition  the company issued in the form of a stock dividend  shares of class b common stock one share for each ten shares of class a common stock held 
no fractional class b shares were issued 
the amended articles of incorporation prohibited any shareholder from acquiring more than a interest in the company s classes of common stock and prohibited the two shareholders who each beneficially then owned in excess of of the company s classes of common stock from increasing their percentage ownership of each class of common stock 
the purpose of the amendment of the articles of incorporation was to provide the company with the necessary flexibility to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit 
the amendment provided that if the company did not make an election to be taxed as a reit on or before march   the restrictions on share ownership would automatically lapse and shares of class b common stock would automatically be converted into shares of class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the company did not make the election and on march   the shares of class b common stock were converted into shares of class a common stock  resulting in the company having  shares of class a common stock outstanding 
no excess stock was issued and it is no longer authorized
