those risk factors expressly qualify all subsequent oral and written forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf 
we do not have any intention or obligation to update forward looking statements included in this form k after the date of this form k  except as required by law 
overview net sales during fiscal decreased approximately from the prior year 
sales were down  on a world wide basis in nearly every major category 
several factors influenced the reduction in sales  including  but not limited to lack of adequate supply of etx products and riflescopes from its foreign sourced suppliers and lower than expected supply of products manufactured domestically  principally meade and coronado branded higher end products  diminished demand and pricing pressure for the company s lowest priced telescope and binocular products and more aggressive price competition  principally in the pricing of certain higher end scopes by meade s primary competitor in that market niche 
euro denominated sales at the company s european subsidiary were relatively flat as compared to the prior year 
however  due to the strengthened euro as compared to the prior year  us dollar sales attributable to the company s european subsidiary increased approximately over the prior year 
sales to lidl  a large german based european retailer and the company s largest customer  increased approximately over the prior year  and represent over of meade europe s net sales and approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal in keeping with the company s strategy to outsource its production to low cost producers  the company transitioned the production of its mid level etx products to a supplier in china during fiscal those products had previously been manufactured  primarily  in the company s irvine  california facility 
delays at the chinese supplier led to significant reduction in availability of those etx products which severely affected sales of those products during the year 
unit and dollar sales of mid level etx products were down approximately from prior year levels 
sales of riflescopes were also negatively affected during fiscal because of continuing supply problems 
sales of riflescopes were down approximately from fiscal levels following a decline in fiscal from fiscal levels principally due to lack of supply 
management took two major steps during fiscal to improve supply chain management at the company 
first  management appointed a new senior vice president of operations and  with that  restructured the operations department  adding two additional senior level managers and emphasizing a process driven supply chain organization 
second  management signed an agreement with three sixty sourcing ltd  a hong kong corporation sourcing 
sourcing will provide the company with assistance for virtually all aspects of its exclusive sourcing in china  including  without limitation  identification and management of chinese suppliers  quality control and assurance  logistics services  business development support  and administrative services 
management believes that the restructuring of the company s operations department and the agreement with sourcing will mitigate the current supply chain problems and eliminate the severe shortages in key products principally riflescopes and mid priced telescopes that the company has experienced over the past two fiscal years 
sales of the company s higher end products were down significantly in fiscal factors influencing the decline include both diminished supply coming from the company s production facilities sales of coronado branded high end products were especially affected by the closing of the coronado production facility in arizona and delays experienced in getting the production on line in california and pricing pressure from the company s principal competitor in the high end market 
sales of telescope accessories were also down significantly during the year reflecting lower sales of the company s dsi astro imagers and lower sales of other accessories following the decline in telescope sales overall 
management can not apportion how much of the high end decline is attributable to lack of supply versus diminished demand due to increased competition 
however  management believes that a majority of its high end products are in production and that production will be able to fully meet demand  and that the combination of new products  effective marketing and appropriate pricing will stimulate demand for the company s higher end products 
the company also experienced a decline in unit and dollar sales of its lower end products  specifically sales of its low end telescopes and binoculars 
this decline was influenced in part by management s decision to be more selective in the retailers that sell these products  eschewing retailers with so called guaranteed sale requirements 
management believes that the costs including  but not limited to  inventory requirements  freight and handling  inspection and repair exceed the benefits of selling on a guaranteed sale basis 
apart from the effects of being more selective with the retailers  sales of lower end telescope and binocular products declined at most of the company s major retailers 
demand for the products was diminished compared to the prior year and the company experienced some pricing pressure as well 
management believes that competition for these types of low end products will continue to be acute 
however  management also believes that it may be able to increase demand for these products with enhanced and new product introductions  targeted marketing and competitive pricing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
those criteria are typically met when product is shipped 
revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment if these criteria are not met 
although there are many factors that influence revenue recognition  the principal reason the company may not recognize revenue at the time of shipment is if the substance of the transaction is a consignment 
consignment type arrangements have happened on a limited basis in the past 
management has  however  decided that  as a standard policy  it will no longer enter into consignment type arrangements 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts product returns or offers markdown incentives 
product returns and markdown incentives are principally related to lower end meade branded products 
management judgments must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales return and incentive allowance estimates 
the company continuously monitors and tracks returns and allowances and records revenues net of provisions for returns and allowances 
the company s estimate of sales returns and allowances is based upon several factors including historical return or markdown experience  current market and economic conditions  customer demand and acceptance of the company s products and or any notification received by the company of such a return 
historically  sales returns and allowances have been concentrated on the company s lower end product lines  have been within management s estimates and were approximately  and of gross sales of such lower end products for the years ended february   and  respectively 
however  actual returns and allowances may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from management s estimates depending on actual market conditions at the time of the return or allowance 
the company has not identified any trends  events or uncertainties that would require a change in management s methodologies or assumptions related to sales return and allowance estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets 
the company also evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete product 
these evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of the company s products  and current market and economic conditions 
inventory reserves are established  based on such judgments  for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than its cost 
inventory reserves represented  and of gross inventory value at february   and  respectively see item exhibits and financial statement schedules schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts 
historically  the net realizable value of the company s inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if the company is not able to meet its sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate significantly from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of the company s inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
the company has not identified any trends  events or uncertainties that would require a change in management s methodologies or assumptions related to determining the net realizable value of its inventories 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
as required by sfas no 
 the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 
any impairment losses will be reflected in operating income 
income taxes a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is necessary in the determination of the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability and the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  the value of that asset will be reduced to its expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
if it is determined that a deferred tax asset that had previously been written down will be realized in the future  the value of that deferred tax asset will be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when the determination is made 
actual results may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the evidence used to assess the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets 
the company has not identified any trends  events or uncertainties that would require a change in management s methodologies or assumptions related to the valuation of its deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended february  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling expenses general and administrative expenses esop contribution expense research and development expenses total operating expenses loss income from operations interest expense loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
sales of the company s higher end telescope products decreased in the aggregate by approximately million from the prior year 
related telescope accessories also decreased from the prior year by approximately million 
sales of the company s mid level etx products decreased by approximately million and sales of the company s less expensive  smaller aperture telescopes decreased from the prior year period by approximately million 
binocular sales were down approximately million and riflescope sales declined by approximately million from prior year sales levels 
partially offsetting these sales declines was an increase in sales of spotting scopes of approximately million  principally on increased sales of spotters to lidl in europe 
also offsetting the sales declines was an increase of nearly million in sales of microscopes and magnifiers 
management believes that as supply problems are resolved  sales of the company s higher end products and accessories and sales of mid level etx products will improve 
management also believes that as the company introduces new and innovative products into the telescope markets several of which are slated for introduction during fiscal and that demand for a broad range of products in that category will be stimulated 
management believes that demand for the company s less expensive telescope and binocular products can be enhanced with new product introductions  targeted marketing and competitive pricing 
included in the above discussion of specific year over year changes is the positive effect of the stronger euro versus the dollar compared to the prior year european us dollar sales were positively affected by approximately million 
gross profit decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of 
the dollar decrease followed the million decrease in net sales and the percentage point decrease in gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales for the period 
a combination of significantly reduced sales volume of higher end products during the current year not covering fixed costs to the extent those costs were covered in the prior year  unit cost increases outpacing average selling price asp increases  unit cost decreases not compensating for discounted asps  the previous two conditions reflecting the aggressive inventory rationalization undertaken by management during the year  and sku reduction led to the overall declines in gross margins 
among the product types that the company buys as finished goods from its various suppliers principally located in china  small imported telescope  mid level etx products  microscopes and magnifiers saw an increase in asps over the asps for fiscal asps for the company s higher end manufactured product categories those sold under the meade and coronado brand names also experienced higher overall asps during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
other imported finished goods including riflescopes  binoculars  and the majority of the company s accessories  all experienced decreases in asps for fiscal as compared to fiscal discounts  markdowns and product mix change were the principal drivers of the lower asps during fiscal despite the improvements in asps for certain imported product types and for the domestically manufactured higher end products  all of the company s imported and domestically manufactured higher end product categories experienced decreased gross margins from the prior year except for binoculars which was the only product category to show gross margin improvement over the prior year 
adding marginally to the decrease in gross profit was approximately million in severance for certain employees in the manufacturing and operations departments included in cost of sales during fiscal there was no corresponding severance included in cost of sales in the prior year 
the strengthened euro versus the dollar did not have a significant effect on gross margin because the european subsidiary utilizes forward contracts on substantially all of its significant dollar inventory purchases 
selling expenses decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of 
the dollar decrease was primarily due to a reduction in marketing and advertising expenses of approximately million as the company rationalized its advertising expenses against lower sales  freight cost reductions of approximately million on lower sales  commission expense reduction of approximately million on lower commissionable sales  and a decrease of approximately million in sales related compensation costs that was completely offset by approximately million in severance costs during fiscal partially offsetting the decreases were increases in temporary labor of approximately million and increased bad debt expense of approximately million 
the increase in selling expenses as a percent of sales compared to the prior year is attributable to the variability of the expenses being less than the variability of sales 
general and administrative expenses increased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in stock compensation costs related to the company s adoption of fas r  an increase of approximately million in accounting and legal fees that were principally related to the company s internal stock option investigation and the related preparation of the company s required filings  and increased temporary labor of approximately million 
general and administrative compensation costs included approximately and million related to severance costs during fiscal and  respectively 
not including severance costs  compensation costs decreased approximately million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
including severance costs  general and administrative compensation costs were unchanged from the prior year 
severance costs incurred during fiscal were related to the departure of the company s general counsel and chief financial officer 
severance during the prior year related to the departure of the company s then chief executive officer 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales compared to the prior year is partially due to the one time nature of several of the charges during the year and the relatively fixed nature of other costs incurred 
stock based compensation expenses  included in general and administrative expenses  related to stock options with exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value at the measurement date were zero in fiscal  and approximately  in fiscal  respectively 
esop contribution expense was relatively flat from the prior year at approximately million in each of the two years  of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
changes in this non cash charge are principally due to changes in the average market value of the company s common stock during the year 
the non cash esop contribution expense may fluctuate as the number of shares allocated and the market value of the company s common stock changes 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million in fiscal of net sales  an increase of 
the increase was principally due to an increase in external research and development consulting costs 
research and development expenses continue to be focused on new product development and product improvement in the company s core consumer product categories 
interest expense decreased from million for fiscal of net sales to million for fiscal of net sales  a decrease of 
this decrease was principally due to lower average borrowings as compared to the prior year 
the tax provision was million on consolidated pre tax losses of million for fiscal this was the result of the company recording a provision for income taxes on pre tax income generated in europe at an estimated rate of the european pre tax income was approximately million for the fiscal year  and no tax benefit recognized on pre tax losses generated by the company s domestic operations domestic operations pre tax loss was approximately million for the year 
the company did not recognize tax benefit on its domestic pre tax losses due to the uncertainty of realizing those benefits 
the company is not recognizing tax benefits for financial reporting purposes because it continues to believe  consistent with its determination made at february   that those tax benefits should not be recognized due to insufficient objective evidence at this time to support recognition of those benefits for financial reporting purposes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended february  was significantly affected by recording a valuation allowance to recognize the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the company s domestic net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was recorded because there was insufficient objective evidence at that time to recognize those assets for financial reporting purposes 
at february   a valuation allowance of approximately million was recorded to offset the company s deferred tax assets 
ultimate realization of any tax benefits is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  including periods prior to the expiration of certain underlying tax credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
sales of the company s higher end telescopes and telescope accessory products increased in the aggregate by approximately million over the prior year 
management believes that the increase in high end sales reflects the market s favorable response to new products introduced late in fiscal and during fiscal included in the approximate million increase in high end product is approximately million related to increased coronado brand product sales 
the prior year reflects only four months of coronado sales compared to a full year in the current period 
sales of the company s less expensive  smaller aperture telescopes increased over the prior year period by approximately million on stronger demand  principally related to the company s etx product lines 
included in the approximate million increase in small telescopes is approximately million from coronado sales 
sales of microscopes  magnifying glasses  laser rangefinders  oem camera products and other miscellaneous products increased  in the aggregate  by approximately million compared to the prior year 
sales increases were offset principally by a decrease in sales of riflescopes of approximately million and a decrease in binocular sales of just under million 
included in the above discussion of specific year over year changes is the negative effect of the stronger dollar versus the euro compared to the prior year european us dollar sales were negatively affected by approximately million 
gross profit increased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the dollar increase followed the increase in net sales and relatively flat gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales for the period 
gross margin was down six tenths of a point compared to the prior year as improvements coming from sales trending to several higher margin products were offset by lower margins at simmons outdoor principally due to discounts on prior year  older technology  products and air freight expenses on the new simmons products 
the air freight was incurred in an effort to provide the company s customers with the simmons products in as timely a manner as possible 
the strengthened dollar versus the euro did not have a significant effect on gross margin because the european subsidiary utilizes forward contracts on substantially all of its significant dollar inventory purchases 
stock based compensation expenses  included in cost of sales  related to stock options with exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value at the measurement date were zero in fiscal compared to  in fiscal selling expenses increased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the dollar increase was primarily due to higher variable costs  principally freight up over million from the prior year  on higher net sales  plus increases in advertising and personnel expenses up approximately million  each 
the increase as a percent of sales was principally due to marketing and advertising costs related to the introduction of the new simmons riflescopes that the company was not able to cancel subsequent to the identification of the significantly lower than expected shipments of simmons riflescopes from the company s asian supplier 
stock based compensation expenses  included in selling expenses  related to stock options with exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value at the measurement date were zero in fiscal compared to  in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in general and administrative expenses includes approximately million in severance payments for the company s outgoing chief executive officer  approximately million in executive search fees related to the search for a new chief executive officer and the addition of personnel in the company s finance department  and nearly million related to management consultants that advised the company on operational matters and internal control documentation 
expenses at the company s european subsidiary increased nearly million on higher consulting fees related to product testing to meet european union requirements approximately million  higher personnel costs and lower foreign currency exchange gains approximately million  each and the balance in higher facilities related costs 
also contributing to the increase was approximately million for coronado general and administrative costs that were not included in the prior year period 
stock based compensation expenses  included in general and administrative expenses  related to stock options with exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value at the measurement date were approximately  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal esop contribution expense decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in this non cash charge was principally due to a decrease in the average market value of the company s common stock over the current year 
the non cash esop contribution expense may fluctuate as the number of shares allocated and the market value of the company s common stock changes 
research and development expenses decreased to million of net sales in fiscal from million in fiscal of net sales  a decrease of 
the decrease was principally due to a decrease in external research and development consulting costs as well as decreased in house personnel costs 
research and development expenses continue to be focused on new product development and product improvement in the company s core consumer product categories 
stock based compensation expenses  included in research and development expenses  related to stock options with exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value at the measurement date were zero in fiscal compared to  in fiscal interest expense increased from million for fiscal of net sales to million for fiscal of net sales  an increase of 
this increase was principally due to higher costs of funds as compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the year ended february  was significantly affected by recording a valuation allowance to recognize the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the company s domestic net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was recorded because there was insufficient objective evidence at the time to recognize those assets for financial reporting purposes 
ultimate realization of the benefit of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods including periods prior to the expiration of certain underlying tax credits 
at february   a valuation allowance of approximately million was recorded to offset the company s deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended february   and  respectively 
the net loss in fiscal was significantly affected by a  valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets 
during fiscal the company continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
the net loss for the year ended february   therefore  reflects no tax benefits on the company s us based pre tax losses which aggregated 
on a consolidated basis  the company incurred pre tax losses of   and  for the years ended february   and  respectively 
net sales during fiscal decreased approximately from fiscal levels 
for the fiscal year  sales were negatively affected as supply shortages expanded to include not just riflescopes but many of the company s foreign sourced and domestically produced telescopes as well 
management can not apportion how much of the decline in sales may be attributable to lack of supply versus diminished market demand 
however  the supply problems during fiscal were severe 
gross margins dropped over seven percentage points during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the combination of significantly reduced sales volume of higher end products during the current year not covering fixed costs to the extent those costs were covered in the prior year  average selling prices dropping or not keeping pace with average cost per unit increases reflecting the aggressive inventory rationalization undertaken by management during fiscal  and sku reduction led to the overall declines in gross margins 
operating margins fell significantly during fiscal as the effects of significant severance costs and increased legal and accounting costs related to late filing of the prior years required filings added to the effects of lower gross margins 
with respect to sales recovering from the declines experienced during fiscal  management believes that sufficient quantities of riflescope and telescope products both domestically produced and foreign sourced are in production and that production will be able to fully meet demand  a combination of new products  effective marketing and appropriate pricing will stimulate demand for the company s higher end products  and while competition for low end products will continue to be acute the company may be able to increase demand for these products with enhanced and new product introductions  targeted marketing and competitive pricing 
supply chain management will be critical to the company s success in achieving its fiscal targets and beyond 
management took two major steps during fiscal to improve supply chain management at the company 
first  management appointed a new senior vice president of operations and  with that  restructured the operations department  adding two additional senior level managers and emphasizing a process driven supply chain organization 
second  management signed an agreement with three sixty sourcing ltd  a hong kong corporation sourcing 
sourcing will provide the company with assistance for virtually all aspects of its exclusive sourcing in china 
management believes that the restructuring of the company s operations department and the agreement with sourcing will mitigate the current supply chain problems and eliminate the severe shortages in key products principally riflescopes and mid priced telescopes that the company has experienced over the past two fiscal years 
as of february   the company had million in cash 
the company funded its operations during the fiscal year with cash and other working capital 
operations generated approximately million in cash  overcoming a million net loss with approximately million in depreciation  amortization and esop expenses  approximately million in stock based compensation expenses  approximately million in bad debt allowances and approximately million and million reductions in inventories and accounts receivable  respectively 
also adding to cash flow from operations was approximately million in increased short term liabilities 
inventories decreased as management continued to focus on inventory reduction through aggressive discounts on older inventories and planned sku count reductions 
lack of sufficient supply of several of the company s primary products also affected inventory levels 
inventories at february  were million on fiscal year sales of million 
inventories at february  were at the lowest level at a year end reporting period since february  when inventories were million on fiscal year sales of million 
overall inventory turns increased to times during fiscal  up from times in fiscal in addition  cash from operations was used to pay down the company s bank lines of credit by approximately million bringing the balance owed on its bank lines to million at february  accounts receivable decreased on lower sales during the company s fourth fiscal quarter as compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable all increased from the prior year and were influenced by the timing of certain expenses and deliberate cash management 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year due to the seasonal nature of the business 
these requirements are typically financed through a combination of internally generated cash flow from operating activities and short term bank borrowings 
continuing losses for the year ended february  led the company to conclude that it would not be in compliance with the minimum ebitda requirement as set forth in the us credit agreement for the period then ended 
accordingly  on may   in anticipation of such non compliance  the company executed the eleventh amendment to amended and restated credit agreement the eleventh amendment 
the eleventh amendment makes the following key changes to the us credit agreement extends the expiration date to september   reduces the facility to  adjusts the pricing grid based on the company s calculated fixed charge coverage ratio  removes the million reserve previously established in the fifth amendment  sets minimum ebitda  tangible net worth and capital expenditure requirements measured on a rolling four quarter basis beginning with the quarter ending may  and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenants measured on a rolling four quarter basis beginning with the quarter ending on may   requires payment of an intercompany loan to the company s european subsidiary in the amount of approximately  by not later than july   and establishes prepayment penalties 
the fee for the amendment was  upon execution of the eleventh amendment the company was in compliance with all of its bank covenants 
availability under the us revolving loan which is subject to a borrowing base with standard advance rates against eligible accounts receivable and inventories at february  was approximately million 
the credit facility expires in september  is collateralized by substantially all of the domestic assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries and contains certain financial covenants including  but not limited to  minimum ebitda levels  minimum tangible net worth targets  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and certain limits on capital expenditures 
amounts outstanding under the us revolving loan bear interest at the bank s base rate or libor rate plus applicable margins at february  
on july   the company s european subsidiary purchased a building for cash of approximately  euro approximately  usd at that date 
the approximately  sq 
ft building  located in rhede  germany  is being used as office and warehouse space 
the building is being depreciated straight line over twenty five years 
in addition to an already existing long term loan with its bank european term loan no 
the european subsidiary obtained a  euro approximately  usd at february  long term loan commitment european term loan no 
toward the purchase of the building 
european term loan no 
bears interest fixed at with monthly principal payments due of approximately  euro approximately  usd at february  for ten years 
on september   the european subsidiary drew down the  euro term loan no 
approximately  usd at that date 
the european subsidiary renegotiates the terms of its short term revolving lines on an annual basis 
currently the european line is  euro approximately  usd at february  increasing to a maximum of  euro approximately  usd at february  during fiscal the line bears interest at euribor plus 
the line increases to  euro approximately  usd at february  from august  through august   then increases to  euro from september  through february  from march  through august  the line returns to  euro 
the aforementioned lines of credit are provided on the condition that an intercompany loan of  be repaid to the company s european subsidiary by july  the european line of credit and term loans are collateralized by all of the principal assets of the subsidiary  are further collateralized by a guarantee from the us parent company in the amount of  euro approximately  usd at february   and require a minimum capitalization of  euro approximately  usd at february  at the subsidiary 
the company continues to depend on operating cash flow and availability under its bank lines of credit to provide short term liquidity 
in the event the company s plans require more capital than is presently anticipated  additional sources of liquidity such as debt or equity financings  may be required to meet its capital needs 
there can be no assurance that such additional sources of capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
however  management believes that operating cash flow and bank borrowing capacity in connection with the company s business should provide sufficient liquidity for the company s obligations for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures aggregated million  million and million for the fiscal years ended february    and  respectively 
contributions to the company s employee stock ownership plan esop are accounted for as a contribution expense on the company s statement of operations and are accrued quarterly based upon the expected annual contribution amount 
as quarterly contributions are accrued  the corresponding number of shares is added to the weighted average common shares outstanding and unearned esop shares on the company s balance sheet are reduced 
the esop uses the contributions to repay amounts due on the esop loan 
the esop contribution expense is a net non cash charge which is added back to net income to arrive at cash flows provided by operating activities 
as the company makes these non cash contributions to the esop to fund the repayment of the esop loan  the company will realize cash tax savings equal to the product of the tax basis of the contributions  multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rates in effect at the time 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of february   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total up to year years years after years long term debt non cancelable operating leases and other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations on december   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of coronado technology group  llc  for approximately million in cash plus contingent consideration 
a final payment of approximately million was paid in may  based upon the financial performance of the acquired operations for the twelve months ended december  inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain levels of market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company conducts business in a number of foreign countries and is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in the euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
in prior years foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on meade s revenues or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that european or other currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
the company has adopted a hedging program to manage its foreign currency exchange rate and  at times  interest rate risks 
upon continuing evaluation and when deemed appropriate by management  the company may enter into hedging instruments to manage its foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks 
from time to time  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the forward exchange contracts vary  typically with the seasonal inventory requirements of the company s german subsidiary 
the company s german subsidiary purchases inventory from asian suppliers in us dollars 
a forward exchange contract is typically entered into when the us dollar amount of the inventory purchase is firm 
given the company s foreign exchange position  a change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
the company does not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
as of february   the company did not have any outstanding forward exchange contracts 
the company s financial instruments consist of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  short term obligations  and long term obligations 
the company s principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the us revolving and term loans 
the debt under the us revolving and term loans bears interest at a floating rate tied to either the libor rate or the bank prime rate of interest 
had us interest rates been one percentage point higher during fiscal  interest expense for the year ended february  would have increased by less than million
