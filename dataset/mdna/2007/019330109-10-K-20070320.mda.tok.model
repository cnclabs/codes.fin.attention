item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview allied motion designs  manufactures and sells motion products to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world primarily for the commercial motor  industrial motion control  and aerospace and defense markets 
the company s products are used in demanding applications in medical equipment  hvac systems for trucks  busses and off road vehicles  the specialty automotive market  industrial automation  pumps  health fitness  defense  aerospace  semiconductor manufacturing  fiber optic based telecommunications  printing  and graphic imaging market sectors  to name a few 
today  five companies form the core of allied motion 
the companies  emoteq  computer optical products  motor products  stature electric and premotec offer a wide range of standard motors  encoders and drives for original equipment manufacturers oem and end user applications 
a particular strength of each company is its ability to design and manufacture custom motion control solutions to meet the needs of its customers 
the company has made considerable progress in implementing its new corporate strategy  the driving force of which is applied motion technology know how 
the company s commitment to allied s systematic tools  or ast for short  is driving continuous improvement in quality  delivery  cost and growth 
ast utilizes a tool kit to effect desired changes through well defined processes such as strategy deployment  target marketing  value stream mapping  material planning  standard work and single minute exchange of dies 
one of the company s major challenges is to maintain and improve price competitiveness 
the company s customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
currently  the company is producing some of its motor sub assemblies and finished products at a sub contract manufacturing facility in china 
the company will continue to look for opportunities where production in low cost regions for certain projects are anticipated to result in increased profits 
the company s products contain certain metals  and the company has been experiencing significant fluctuations in the costs of these metals  particularly copper  steel and zinc  which are both key materials in our products 
the company has reacted by aggressively sourcing material at lower cost from asian markets  combining the sourcing of metals to benefit from volume purchasing and by passing on surcharges to our customers 
the company has an aggressive motor development plan for five new standalone products and two new product lines that leverage the combined technology base of the allied motion companies 
the company continues to focus on new product designs that design out cost  provide higher performance and meet the needs of our served markets 
early in  the company announced several new motor designs targeted at various markets 
each of these motors are targeted at precision motor applications 
it normally takes twelve months to get new products designed into new customer applications 
all product development efforts are focused on adding value for our customers in our served market segments 
management believes the strategy we have developed for the company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability

revenues revenues were  in compared to  in or a increase 
the incremental revenues achieved by the companies acquired in increased revenues by which were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from existing businesses of 
on a proforma basis  sales from premotec and stature increased and consolidated sales decreased 
the decrease in existing business is primarily due to revenues related to certain projects last year that were not repeated this year  primarily in the aerospace defense and electronics markets and changes in customer buying patterns 
gross margins gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for and for the decrease is due to a change in sales mix significant drop in sales of our higher margin business partially offset by increased sales of lower margin business  the weighting of the lower margins of the acquired businesses  additional costs incurred to set up low cost manufacturing capability in china and the negative impact of the upward trend in the cost of purchased metal 
the company has proactively responded to the increased metal costs by aggressively sourcing materials from asian markets  by combining the sourcing of metals for its various manufacturing operations to benefit from volume purchasing and by passing surcharges to its customers 
the company anticipates gross margins will improve company wide as we continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies through the implementation of lean manufacturing  by increasing offshore sourcing of materials and from continued cost reduction efforts to reduce overhead costs and expenses 
we also anticipate that we will start realizing improved margins from products manufactured in our low cost manufacturing facilities in selling expenses selling expenses were  and  in and  respectively 
of this increase  selling expenses from existing businesses decreased and incremental expenses from stature and premotec contributed of this increase

non gaap measures ebitda is provided for information purposes only and is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by the company s management to measure the operating performance of the company s business because ebitda excludes charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings  as well as our provision for income tax expense 
accordingly  the company believes that ebitda provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business  apart from the expenses associated with its physical assets or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the company s industry 
ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s calculation of ebitda for year ended december  and is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  net income interest expense provision for income tax depreciation and amortization income before interest expense  provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased  during to a balance of  at december  the increase compares to a  increase in the same period last year

under the domestic revolving line of credit agreement agreement  the company has available the lesser of a  or b the sum of of eligible trade accounts receivable excluding premotec and of eligible inventory  as defined in the agreement 
under the agreement  the company utilizes lock box arrangements whereby remittances from customers reduce the outstanding debt  and therefore the line of credit balance has been classified as a current liability 
as of december   the amount available under the domestic line of credit was  under the foreign line of credit agreement foreign agreement  the company has available the lesser of a eur million million as of december   or b of eligible trade accounts receivable of premotec as defined in the foreign agreement 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s base rate plus  with a minimum of at december  
under the foreign agreement  remittances from customers reduce the outstanding debt  therefore the balance has been classified as a current liability 
as of december   the amount available under the foreign line of credit was  the company has a bank overdraft facility payable to a foreign bank with no monthly repayments required  interest due at the bank s base rate plus  with a minimum of as of december   due on demand  secured by premotec s inventory

borrowings under the new line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s base rate plus  with a minimum of 
the company also has various term loans obtained in connection with its acquisitions 
all borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
the loan agreements prohibit the company from paying dividends and require that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth and profitability 
as of december   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
as of december   the amount available under the lines of credit and overdraft facility was  the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the line of credit facilities 
the company s domestic line of credit expires in may the company is currently in discussions with lenders regarding its global debt financing needs 
the company believes it will be successful in obtaining debt financing facilities and that such debt financing facilities and the company s capital currently available is sufficient to meet its currently anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
if additional capital is needed in the future  the company would pursue additional capital via debt or equity financings 
a key component of the company s liquidity relates to the availability of amounts under its lines of credit 
any lack of availability of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies  lower costs of materials and surcharges passed on to customers 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies are reviewed on a regular basis 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
the company uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based on historical experience and judgments based on current economic and customer specific factors 
significant judgments are made by management in connection with establishing the company s customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  the company s customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
the company continues to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which may not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of the company s customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company monitors and forecasts expected inventory needs based on historical usage and sales forecasts 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if actual market conditions are significantly different from those projected by management the recorded reserve may be adjusted  and such adjustments may have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly  and in the past the company has recorded substantial charges for inventory obsolescence and excess inventories 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
provides a fair value test to evaluate goodwill and long lived asset impairment 
as part of the review  the company estimates future cash flows 
depending upon future assessments of fair value and estimated future cash flows  there could be impairment recorded related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for certain domestic retirees and records the cost of the obligations based on estimates 
the net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the benefits 
several assumptions are used to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  the future rate of compensation increases and health care cost increases 
the discount rate is selected based on a bond pricing model that relates to the projected future cash flows of benefit obligations 
actuarial assumptions used are based on demographic factors such as retirement and mortality 
actual results could vary materially from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pension or postretirement benefits

in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas  which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material to be excluded from inventory costing and instead included as period expenses

the company adopted the standard on january  and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the interpretation requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position must be more likely than not ie  greater than likelihood of receiving a benefit before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
further  the interpretation prescribes the benefit to be recorded in the financial statements as the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions 
the interpretation also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
the interpretation is effective in the first quarter for allied motion and the company plans to adopt the interpretation when required 
the interpretation is currently being evaluated by allied motion for its full impact 
at this time  the company believes it has properly and adequately provided for all income tax positions and therefore expects minimal impact from adopting the interpretation

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the company implemented sab january  and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb no 
 fair value measurements 
fas is definitional and disclosure oriented and addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by gaap  it does not create or modify any current gaap requirements to apply fair value accounting 
the standard provides a single definition for fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications  and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and inputs used in valuations 
fas prescribes various disclosures about financial statement categories and amounts which are measured at fair value  if such disclosures are not already specified elsewhere in gaap 
the new measurement and disclosure requirements of fas are effective for allied motion in the first quarter the company expects no significant impact from adopting the standard 
contractual commitments for more information on the company s contractual obligations on operating leases and contractual commitments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s commitments under these obligations were as follows in thousands year ending operating capital line of term interest on debt december  leases leases credit loans obligations total thereafter the capital lease commitments include amounts representing interest

the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s domestic and foreign lines of credit and its foreign term loan are variable based on the prime rate and euribor  and are effected by changes in market interest rates 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
a change in the interest rate of on the company s variable rate debt would have the impact of changing interest expense by approximately  annually 
foreign currency risk on august   the company completed the acquisition of premotec  located in the netherlands 
sales from this operation are denominated in euros  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the euro us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins  net income and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company
