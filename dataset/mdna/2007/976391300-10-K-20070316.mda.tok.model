item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a real estate investment trust reit engaged in the business of owning real property and real estate related assets 
we operate in three strategic business segments i operating properties  ii loans and iii real estate securities 
we may make investments in each of these segments directly and in strategic alliances and joint ventures with third parties our business objective is to maximize long term shareholder value through a total return value approach to real estate investing 
we measure our success in meeting this objective by a number of factors  including increases in diluted per share net income  cash returns generated by our investments  increases in shareholder equity and total return to our shareholders 
during  and  our operating results were as follow net income applicable to common shares   net income per common share  basic net income per common share  diluted net cash provided by operating activities  total assets    with certain self imposed limitations  we will seek opportunities to invest in or acquire most types of real estate assets or securities 
we believe that entering into specific strategic alliances and joint ventures with regional or specialized real estate professionals provides us with a platform to be extremely competitive in markets in which we are not currently located or have a management infrastructure in place 
also  we seek to enter into strategic co investment joint ventures with institutional and high net worth investors to enhance our total return through acquisitions  asset management and other fees and a promoted economic interest 
in view of the foregoing  our near term investment strategy will be to identify and invest in discrete real estate investments including investments through joint ventures 
as market conditions dictate  we will focus our investment activity in one or more of our business segments and aggressively pursue such opportunities 
we intend to fund these investments through one or more of the following cash reserves  borrowings under our credit facility  property loans  issuance of debt and equity on joint ventures with third parties 
for the long term  as investments mature in value to the point where we are unlikely to achieve better than a market return on their then enhanced value  it is likely we will exit the investment and seek to redeploy the capital to higher yielding opportunities 
therefore  non recurring items are an important part of our overall earnings 
significant investments  dispositions and financing transactions during included l acquiring three office properties containing approximately  square feet  l acquiring in a joint venture  two loans secured by first priority liens on  square feet of commercial space  an indoor parking structure  the underlying land and unsold condominiums at a property commonly referred to as river city in chicago  illinois  l forming concord debt holdings llc f k a debt holdings llc a joint venture with lexington and investing  to acquire and originate approximately  in loans and originated a collateral debt obligation pool  l selling all of our  shares in sizeler property investors inc for an aggregate sales price of approximately  representing an aggregate gain excluding dividends of  l obtaining  in first mortgage indebtedness  l issuing a total of  common shares in november pursuant to an underwritten public offering for a per share price of after underwriters discount resulting in net proceeds of l entering into two joint venture relationships with local partners which hold properties containing approximately  square feet for an aggregate investment of  and l modification of our mortgage debt encumbering certain of our net lease properties commonly referred to as the finova portfolio 
other significant events for the year ended december  included l entered into new leases and renewed leases totaling approximately  square feet  l increased average portfolio occupancy to  l redeeming our series a preferred shares  l issuing rights to our common and preferred shareholders to subscribe for and purchase up to an aggregate of  of newly issued common shares for a price of per common share  which was fully subscribed  raising net proceeds in the second quarter of of approximately  l establishing a quarterly dividend of per common share retroactive to january   and l issuing a total of  common shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan for net proceeds of  trends competition we face substantial competition for our targeted investments 
our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the growth of our investment portfolio  depends to a significant degree on our ability to implement our investment policy and operating strategies 
we compete with numerous other companies for investments  including other reits  insurance companies  real estate opportunity funds  pension funds and a multitude of private investors 
many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and for this and other reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully for particular investments 
we will continue to capitalize on the acquisition and investment opportunities that our advisor brings to us as a result of its acquisition experience as well as our partners in joint ventures which serve as platforms to investments in various geographic areas and particular classes of assets 
through its broad experience  our advisor s senior management team has established a network of contacts and relationships  including relationships with operators  financiers  commercial real estate brokers  potential tenants and other key industry participants 
in addition we believe that our advisor s significant real estate management infrastructure gives us economies of scale that provides us with a competitive advantage when bidding on investment opportunities 
interest rate environment interest rates can fluctuate 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  options  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the potential negative effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our operations 
in the past  we entered into the following agreements in order to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility i an interest rate swap with a  notional amount that effectively converted the interest rate on that portion of principal of our note payable to keybank  with an outstanding balance at december  of  secured by certain of our net lease properties  from a floating rate equal to libor plus to a fixed libor rate of plus and ii an interest rate swap with a balance guaranty on our repurchase agreement with respect to our first mortgage residential whole pool loan certificates  which bears interest at libor minus  effectively fixing our rate at on that financing 
we do not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative purposes but only for interest rate risk management 
liquidity and capital resources general liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments and other general business needs 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility and issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required for our investment activities 
additionally  to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of l cash and cash equivalents  l operating cash flow derived primarily from rental income received from our operating properties  l debt service received from loans held  l dividends received from our ownership of real estate securities  and l borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we also raised funds through equity offerings and debt financings 
we had cash and cash equivalents of  at december   which consisted of  in cash and  in cash equivalents with maturities of less than days 
in addition  we had  available under our credit facility 
in the future  we may raise additional funds through debt financing and or equity offerings 
toward that end i in april we issued  common shares in a registered rights offering to our existing holders resulting in net proceeds of  ii in august we instituted a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drip pursuant to which holders of our common shares can reinvest all or a portion of the dividends paid on the common shares as well as invest additional sums in our common shares  and iii in november we issued  newly issued common shares in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement resulting in net proceeds of  at december   we had an effective registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of approximately  of additional equity or debt securities 
in addition  our upreit structure will also enable us to acquire properties by issuing to sellers  as a form of consideration  limited partnership interests in our operating partnership 
although to date we have not issued limited partnership interests in a transaction  we believe that this structure will facilitate our ability to acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties by enabling us to structure transactions which will defer taxes payable by a seller while preserving our available cash for other purposes  including the possible payment of dividends 
revolving future cash requirements the following table sets forth the timing of our payment obligations related to our off balance sheet and contractual obligations  including all fixed and variable rate debt obligations  except as otherwise noted  as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years mortgage loans payable     principal and interest revolving line of credit principal and interest loans payable    principal and interest repurchase agreements   ground lease obligations advisors fee     off balance sheet obligations commitments concord   vision   capital and tenant improvements   the underlying lease agreements require the tenant to pay the ground rent expense 
base management fee based upon the terms of the advisory agreement and equity and assets in place at december   with no effect given to the additional investments  equity issuances or incentive compensation to fur advisors 
no amounts have been included due to the automatic annual renewal provisions of the advisory agreement 
excludes pending acquisitions that are subject to due diligence 
under the terms of our agreement with marc realty  as of december   we were required to loan an additional  to fund capital and tenant improvements 
we carry comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance i fire  ii flood  iii extended coverage  iv acts of terrorism  as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of  and v rental loss insurance with respect to our properties where coverage is not provided by our net lease tenants 
under the terms of the net leases  the tenant is obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are generally non recourse to us contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance 
although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements  we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain at reasonable costs  it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio 
cash flows our level of liquidity based upon cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately  during the year ended december  the increase resulted from  of cash provided by operating activities and  of cash provided by our financing activities  which was partially offset by  of cash used in our investing activities 
cash provided by operating activities of  was comprised of i net income of  ii net negative adjustments for non cash items of  and iii a net negative change in operating assets and liabilities of  the adjustments for non cash items were primarily comprised of increases due to i depreciation and amortization of  ii minority interest expense of  iii distributions in excess of equity in earnings of preferred equity investment of  iv loss on early extinguishment of debt of  and v a decrease in interest receivable on loans of  the decreases in non cash items were primarily due to i gain on sale of exclusivity rights of  ii gain on sale of equity investment of  iii net gains on sale of securities available for sale of  iv the effect of straight lining of rental income of  v equity in earnings of equity investments in excess of distributions of  vi gain on winn dixie settlement of  vii interest earned on restricted cash of  and viii bad debt recoveries of  see our results of operations below for additional details on our operations 
cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of i  of proceeds received from prepayment on whole pool mortgage backed securities available for sale and ii  of proceeds from the sale of various real estate securities owned 
the balance related to the  of loans receivable collected and  of proceeds from the sale of preferred equity investments 
the significant components of the cash we used for our investing activities during were as follows i  for purchases of whole pool mortgage backed securities available for sale  ii  for our preferred equity investment in marc realty  iii the origination or purchase of loans totaling  iv  for building acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing operating properties  v  increase in restricted cash  vi  for purchases of various real estate securities  vii  for our investment in concord and vii  for an investment in our limited partnership 
cash provided by financing activities was the result of several transactions including i borrowings under repurchase agreements of  ii contributions from minority partners of  iii  of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares  iv  of mortgage loan proceeds  and v  of proceeds from our revolving line of credit with keybank 
we used cash for financing activities including i  of dividend payments on our series a preferred shares  ii  of dividend payments on our common shares  iii  of repayment of borrowings under repurchase agreements  iv  of mortgage loan repayments  v  of distributions to minority interests  vi  of deferred financing costs  vii  of paydowns of our revolving line of credit with keybank  and viii  of loan payable repayments

loans interest income from our loan investments was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to our investment in the toy building loan which generated  of interest income during the year ended december   and our investment in whole pool agency mortgage backed securities  which generated interest income of  during this same period 
equity in earnings in preferred equity investments increased by  to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to our april origination of mezzanine loans and two second mortgage loans  commonly referred to as the marc realty portfolio and the sale in of four of the properties indirectly securing these loans  which generated a gain of approximately  real estate securities during we increased income from our investment in real estate securities by  most notably by our investment in newkirk

louis  missouri property as a result of the pending condemnation proceedings by the city of st

critical accounting policies and estimates our most critical accounting policy relates to the evaluation of the carrying value of real estate  loans and our investments in joint ventures 
we evaluate the need for an impairment loss on a real estate asset when indicators of impairment are present and the projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are not sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
the projection of cash flows used in the impairment evaluation involves significant judgment by management 
the allocation of the purchase price to operating properties upon acquisition also involves significant management judgment and has a significant impact on the amount and timing of depreciation and amortization 
upon acquisition of an operating property  the fair value of the real estate  which includes the impact of mark to market adjustments for assumed mortgage debt related to the property acquired  is allocated to tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and the value of tenant relationships  based in each case on management s determination of fair value 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  and identified intangible such as above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections and utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we also invest in mezzanine loans 
in connection with these mezzanine loans  we may also acquire an ownership interest in the borrower that allows us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flow from operations as well as proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management determines whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  preferred equity  joint venture or as real estate 
this requires management to use judgment in evaluating the substance of the investment and impacts the timing and amount of income recognized from the investment 
we currently classify all of our mezzanine loans  where we also acquire an ownership interest in the borrower and receive a preferred return  as preferred equity investments 
in addition  our loans are periodically evaluated for possible impairment in order to determine whether it is necessary to establish a loan loss reserve 
in some instances  if a borrower is experiencing difficulties making loan payments  we may assist the borrower to address the problems  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in our judgment  it is probable we will not receive all contractually required payments when they are due  the loan is deemed impaired  and a loan loss reserve established 
as of december  we have determined that no loan loss reserve is necessary 
our investments in equity and joint venture investments are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our equity investments is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment change if we determine that a decline in value of an investment is other than temporary 
finally  estimates are used when accounting for the allowance for contingent liabilities and other commitments 
all of the estimates and evaluations are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from the estimates and evaluations

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement provides a fair value option under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities 
this fair value option will be available on a contract by contract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the effective date for this statement is the beginning of each reporting entity s first fiscal year end that begins after november  the statement also allows an entity to early adopt the statement as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after the issuance of this statement  provided that the entity also adopts the requirement of sfas no

however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement clarifies that market participant assumptions include assumptions about risk  for example  the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as a pricing model and or risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
this statement clarifies that market participant assumptions also include assumptions about the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset 
this statement also clarifies that a fair value measurement for a liability reflects its nonperformance risk

the adoption of sab on december  did not have a material effect on the trust s consolidated financial statements 
funds from operations we compute funds from operations ffo as shown in the calculation below 
funds from operations is a non gaap financial measure which represents funds from operations as defined by nareit 
nareit defines funds from operations as net income  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we consider ffo a useful additional measure of performance because it can facilitate a comparison of current operating performance among reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance or liquidity 
the following presents a reconciliation of our net income to our funds from operations for the years ended december  and december  in thousands  except per share amounts for the year ended net income    real estate depreciation    amortization of capitalized leasing costs   real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated interests  less minority interest share of depreciation and amortization   gain on sale of real estate  gain on sale of operating property of unconsolidated interests  gain on exchange of newkirk realty trust  funds from operations    series a preferred dividend   funds from operations applicable to common shares    interest expense on series b shares   series a preferred dividend  funds from operations applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions    basic weighted average common shares    convertible preferred shares   stock options diluted weighted average common shares   funds from operations per share diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the potential negative effects of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flow and earnings 
among our liabilities are both fixed and variable rate debt 
in an attempt to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on the variable rate portion of this debt  we entered into the following agreements i an interest rate swap with a  notional amount that effectively converted the interest rate on that portion of principal of our note payable to keybank  with an outstanding balance at december  of  from a floating rate equal to libor plus to a fixed rate of and ii an interest rate swap with a balance guaranty on our repurchase agreement with respect to our first mortgage whole pool loan certificates which bears interest at libor minus  effectively fixing our rate at on that financing 
the notional amount of the balance guaranty swap was  at december  the fair value of our fixed rate debt  based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt  exceeded its carrying value by  and at december  and  respectively 
the following table shows what the annual effect a change in the libor rate would have on interest expense based upon the unhedged balances in variable rate loans at december  change in libor change in consolidated interest expense pro rata share of change in interest expense of debt on non consolidated entities minority partners share proforma increase decrease in net income we may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the potential negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings  including hedging strategies  depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
in addition  we have a pro rata share of notes and mortgage loans receivable aggregating  as of december   which are based on variable rates and partially mitigate our exposure to change in interest rates 
market value risk our mortgage backed securities are reflected at their estimated fair value of  at december  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities
