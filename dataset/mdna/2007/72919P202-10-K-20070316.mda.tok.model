overview we design and develop on site energy systems based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology  for commercial and residential energy consumers worldwide 
we are focused on platform based systems  which include proton exchange membrane  or pem  fuel cell and fuel processing technologies  from which we are offering or developing multiple products 
we are currently offering our gencore product for commercial sale 
our gencore product is a back up power product for telecommunications  broadband  utility and industrial uninterruptible power supply  or ups  applications 
we are also developing additional products for continuous run power applications  with optional combined heat and power capability for remote small commercial and remote residential applications 
we are a development stage enterprise in the early period of field testing and marketing our initial commercial products to a limited number of customers  including telecommunications companies  utilities  government entities and our distribution partners 
our initial commercial product  the gencore t  is designed to provide direct current backup power for the targeted application described above 
see product development and commercialization 
the gencore t is fueled by hydrogen and does not require a fuel processor 
our sales and marketing strategy is to build a network of leading distributors who have established relationships  and sub distributor networks  that can distribute and service our products in targeted geographic and or market segments 
we have distribution agreements in place with distributors  including tyco  our largest north american distribution partner and ist  our distribution partner in south africa with whom we jointly received a million customer buy down grant from the international finance corporation in we also form relationships with customers and enter into development and demonstration programs with telecommunications companies  electric utilities  government agencies and other energy providers 
many of our initial sales of gensys and gencore t are contract specific arrangements containing multiple obligations that may include a combination of fuel cell systems  continued service  maintenance and other support 
the multiple obligations within our contractual arrangements are not accounted for separately based on our limited commercial experience and available evidence of fair value 
as a result  we defer recognition of product and service revenue and recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the contractual terms as the continued service  maintenance and other support obligations expire  which are generally for periods of twelve to thirty months 
however  if the warranty or service period is expected to exceed the contractual warranty service period the deferred revenue would be recognized over that expected longer warranty service period and may not begin until units are installed 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
as we gain commercial experience  including field experience relative to service and warranty of our initial products  the fair values for the multiple elements within our future contracts may become determinable and we 
table of contents may  in future periods  recognize product revenue upon delivery or installation of the product  or we may continue to defer recognition  based on application of appropriate guidance within eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or changes in the manner in which we structure contractual agreements  including our agreements with distribution partners 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our product development activities  ability to commercialize our fuel cell systems  market acceptance of our systems and other factors 
we expect to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaling million and working capital of million 
during the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was million  consisting primarily of a net loss of million offset  in part  by non cash expenses in the amount of million  including million for amortization and depreciation and million for stock based compensation 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting of million of net purchases of marketable securities  million used to purchase property  plant and equipment and a million loan made to a potential investee 
cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of net proceeds  in the amount of million  from the sale of our class b capital stock to smart hydrogen and payment of million to settle our debt obligation related to the purchase of the facilities in we have financed our operations through december   primarily from the sale of equity  which has provided cash in the amount of million since inception 
cumulative net cash used in operating activities has been million  and cash used in investing activities has been million  including our purchase of property  plant and equipment of million and our net investments in marketable securities in the amount of million offset  in part  by net proceeds from acquisition of million 
product development and commercialization we are focused on a fuel cell technology platform from which we believe we can offer multiple products 
we currently have one commercial product line  gencore  which we continue to enhance and broaden gencore back up power for telecommunication  broadband  utility and ups applications we currently offer the gencore product line which is focused on providing direct current backup power for telecom  broadband  utility and industrial ups market applications 
our gencore products are fueled by hydrogen and do not require a fuel processor 
see distribution  marketing and strategic relationships for additional information regarding product development and commercialization 
additionally  we continue to advance the development of our other technology platforms gensys remote continuous power for light commercial and residential applications we plan to continue to develop gensys into a platform that is expected to support a number of products  including systems fueled by liquefied petroleum gas  or lpg  for remote applications and  eventually  both grid independent and grid connected light commercial and residential applications fueled by lpg or natural gas 
in connection with the development of our gensys platform  we are developing combined heat and power fuel cell systems for light commercial and residential applications that provide supplemental heat as electricity is produced 
we began field testing of the next generation gensys  our continuous run product  in the third quarter of see distribution  marketing and strategic relationships for additional information regarding product development and commercialization 
home energy station we have been developing technology in support of the automotive fuel cell market under a series of agreements with honda r d co ltd 
of japan honda  a subsidiary of honda motor co  ltd  under which we have developed  on a joint and exclusive basis  and tested three phases of prototype fuel cell systems that provide electricity and heat to a home or business  while also providing 
table of contents hydrogen fuel for a fuel cell vehicle named the home energy station 
since  we have successfully demonstrated three successive prototype generations of the home energy station at honda r d americas facility in torrance  california and at plug power s facility in latham  ny 
the companies are currently collaborating on the fourth generation prototype home energy station pursuant to the latest agreement signed in early across each generation of the home energy station  we have significantly reduced size and weight  as well as improved performance 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  product and service revenue 
product and service revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in the amount of revenue recognized for units shipped prior to we defer recognition of product and service revenue at the time of delivery and recognize revenue as the continued service  maintenance and other support obligations expire 
however  if the warranty or service period is expected to exceed the contractual warranty service period the deferred revenue would be recognized over that expected longer warranty service period and may not begin until units are installed 
the costs associated with the product  service and other obligations are expensed as they are incurred 
many of our initial sales of gensys and gencore t products contain multiple obligations that may include a combination of fuel cell systems  continued service  maintenance and other support 
while contract terms generally require payment shortly after delivery and installation of the fuel cell system and are not contingent on the achievement of specific milestones or other substantive performance  the multiple obligations within our contractual arrangements are not accounted for separately based on our limited commercial experience and available evidence of fair value of the different components 
as a result  we defer recognition of product and service revenue and recognize revenue on a straight line basis as the continued service  maintenance and other support obligations expire  which are generally for periods of twelve to thirty months 
however  if the warranty or service period is expected to exceed the contractual warranty service period the deferred revenue would be recognized over that expected longer warranty service period and recognition of revenue may not begin until units are installed 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
during the year ended december   we shipped fuel cell systems and recognized product and service revenue against these current year deliveries in the amount of  we also recognized million of revenue originally deferred at december  this compares to fuel cell systems shipped for the year ended december   during which we recognized  of product and service revenue against deliveries and million of revenue originally deferred at december  of the shipments  units were on a consignment basis and no revenues were recorded in total installations for the year ended december  were units compared with the units for the comparable period 
units shipped and not installed at december  were including units shipped on consignment  compared with at the end of during and  we invoiced million and million  respectively  for the delivery of fuel cell systems and recognized revenue of million and million  respectively 
any differences between the amounts invoiced and the recognized revenue is a result of deferred revenue recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as described above 
research and development contract revenue 
research and development contract revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is the result of spending levels decreasing for material purchases and subcontractor activity as the us department of energy  or doe  and the us department of defense  or dod  programs wind down and decreased activity under our contract with the national institute of standards and technology  or nist  and with 
table of contents honda r d co  ltd 
of japan 
we expect to continue certain research and development contract work that is directly related to our current product development efforts 
research and development contract revenue primarily relates to cost reimbursement research and development contracts associated with the development of pem fuel cell technology 
we generally share in the cost of these programs with our cost sharing percentages being from to of total project costs 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized on the basis of hours expended plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
we expect to continue certain research and development contract work that is directly related to our current product development efforts 
cost of product and service revenue 
cost of product and service revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of product and service revenue includes the direct material cost incurred in the manufacture of the products we sell as well as the labor and material costs incurred for product maintenance  replacement parts and service under our contractual obligations 
these costs consist primarily of production materials and fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services 
the year over year increase to cost of product and service revenue is primarily the result of an increase in warranty costs resulting from a greater number of units placed in the field during for the year ended december  installations were units compared with units for the year ended december  cost of research and development contract revenue 
cost of research and development contract revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of research and development contract revenue includes costs associated with research and development contracts including compensation and benefits for engineering and related support staff  fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services  fees paid to consultants for services provided  materials and supplies used and other directly allocable general overhead costs allocated to specific research and development contracts 
the decrease in these costs is directly related to the decreased activity under the development agreements described above under research and development contract revenue 
noncash research and development expense 
noncash research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  noncash research and development expense represents the fair value of vested stock grants and vested stock options to employees  consultants and others in exchange for services provided 
the increase is primarily the result of the company s adoption of sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other research and development expense 
other research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in other research and development expense is primarily the result of our accelerated efforts to advance the development of our next generation continuous run product combined with continued research and development activities related to future product initiatives 
we also had fewer resources allocated to research and development programs reflected in cost of revenues for research and development under doe  nist and honda research and development contracts as discussed above 
other research and development expense includes materials to build development and prototype units  cash compensation and benefits for the engineering and related staff  expenses for contract engineers  fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services  fees paid to consultants for services provided  materials and supplies consumed  facility related costs such as computer and network services and other general overhead costs 
other research and development expense also includes amortization in the amount of and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the portion of the h power purchase price that represented capitalized technology and was recorded on our balance sheet under the caption intangible assets 
as of december   the carrying value of these intangible assets had been fully amortized 
noncash general and administrative expense 
noncash general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  noncash 
table of contents general and administrative expense represents the fair value of vested stock grants and vested stock options to employees  consultants and others in exchange for services provided 
the year over year expense remained relatively flat as the increase in expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas r see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements was offset by a decrease in expenses for consultants 
other general and administrative expense 
other general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other general and administrative expense includes cash compensation  benefits and related costs in support of our general corporate functions  including general management  finance and accounting  human resources  marketing  information technology and legal services 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses is primarily a result of increased headcount  charges related to severance packages for departing employees and payments made to strategic consultants 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities  consisting primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of higher cash and marketable securities balances as a result of the sale of our class b capital stock to smart hydrogen inc in and slightly higher yields on our investment portfolio 
total net realized gains losses from available for sale securities was approximately a thousand gain and a thousand loss for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on a long term obligation related to the purchase of our facilities and interest paid on capital lease obligations 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  as of december  the debt associated with the purchase of the facility was paid for in full 
the long term debt accrued interest at a variable rate that was approximately for the year ended december  equity in losses of affiliates 
equity in losses of affiliates was for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  equity in losses of affiliates  which we accounted for under the equity method of accounting  was our proportionate share of the amount of the net loss of ge fuel cell systems  or gefcs  and the amortization of our original investments 
during the quarter ended december   the company recorded an impairment loss equal to of the remaining carrying value of the company s investment in gefcs due to the changes in the relationship that eventually resulted in gefcs being dissolved in the first quarter of fiscal income taxes 
we did not report a benefit for federal and state income taxes in the consolidated financial statements as the deferred tax asset generated from our net operating loss has been offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carry forward will not be realized 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  product and service revenue 
product and service revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we delivered fuel cell systems and recognized product and service revenue against these current year deliveries in the amount of  combined with the recognition of million of revenue originally deferred at december  this compares to fuel cell systems delivered for the year ended december   during which we recognized million of product and service revenue against deliveries combined with the recognition of million of revenue originally deferred at december  
table of contents during and  we invoiced million and million  respectively  for the delivery of fuel cell systems and recognized revenue of million and million in and  respectively 
the difference between the amounts invoiced and the recognized revenue in and represents a component of deferred revenue at december  and research and development contract revenue 
research and development contract revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is the result of prior spending levels dropping off for material purchases and subcontractor activity as the us department of energy doe programs wind down and decreased activity under our contract with national institute of standards and technology nist and with honda r d co  ltd 
of japan 
we expect to continue certain research and development contract work that is directly related to our current product development efforts 
cost of product and service revenue

these costs consist primarily of production materials and fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services 
the year over year decrease to cost of product and service revenue is directly related to an increased proportion of our fuel cell system deliveries coming from gencore product which has a lower direct materials cost per unit than our gensys product 
our gencore products are fueled by hydrogen and do not require a fuel processor  thereby eliminating certain costs 
for the year ended december  we shipped gencore units and gensys units compared to and gencore and gensys units  respectively  in cost of research and development contract revenue 
cost of research and development contract revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of research and development contract revenue includes costs associated with research and development contracts including compensation and benefits for engineering and related support staff  fees paid to outside suppliers for subcontracted components and services  fees paid to consultants for services  and materials and supplies and other directly allocable general overhead costs allocated to specific research and development contracts 
the decrease in these costs is directly related to the decreased activity under the development agreements described above under research and development contract revenue 
noncash research and development expense 
noncash research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  noncash research and development expense represents the fair value of vested stock grants to employees  consultants and others in exchange for services provided 
the decrease is primarily the result of fully expensing restricted stock issued in june in we had a full year of such amortization 
other research and development expense 
other research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expense is primarily the result of our accelerated efforts to advance the development of our next generation continuous run product combined with continued research and development activities related to future product initiatives 
we also had fewer resources allocated to research and development programs reflected in cost of revenues for research and development under doe  nist and honda research and development contracts as discussed above

other general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other general and administrative expense includes compensation  benefits and related costs in support of our general corporate functions including general management  finance and accounting  human resources  marketing  information technology and legal services 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses is the result of our increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december   in support of commercialization of our products 
interest income and net realized gains losses from the sale of available for sale securities 
interest income  consisting of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in our investment portfolio from funds received as a result of our public offering of  shares of common stock in august  see liquidity and capital resources

additionally  during the fourth quarter of we recorded an other than temporary impairment of our investment in gefcs  in the amount of million  in accordance with apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  primarily due to a shift in the company s business strategy away from residential fuel cells  for which gefcs was well suited as a distribution partner  to back up power generation  for which gefcs is not a natural partner 
based upon this shift in strategy it was determined that gefcs lacked the ability to sustain an earning capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
income taxes 
we did not report a benefit for federal and state income taxes in the consolidated financial statements as the deferred tax asset generated from our net operating loss has been offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carry forward may not be realized 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and related disclosure requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of assets  including identifiable intangibles  and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
therefore  our financial statements and related disclosure are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from estimates 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause management to revise estimates  our financial position as reflected in our financial statements will be affected 
any effects on business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies affected by the estimates and assumptions the company must make in the preparation of its financial statements and related disclosure revenue recognition we are a development stage enterprise in the stages of performing field testing and marketing our initial commercial product to a limited number of customers  including telecom  utilities  government entities and our distribution partners 
this product is a limited edition fuel cell system that is intended to offer complementary  quality power while demonstrating the market value of fuel cells as a preferred form of alternative distributed power generation 
subsequent enhancements to our initial product are expected to expand the market opportunity for fuel cells by lowering the installed cost  decreasing operating and maintenance costs  increasing efficiency  improving reliability  and adding features such as grid independence and co generation and ups applications 
we apply the guidance within staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab to our initial sales contracts to determine when to properly recognize revenue 
our initial sales of gensys and gencore t products contain multiple obligations that may include a combination of fuel cell systems  continued service  maintenance and other support 
while contract terms generally require payment shortly after delivery and installation of the fuel cell system and are not contingent on the achievement of specific milestones or other substantive performance  the multiple obligations within our contractual arrangements are not accounted for separately based on our limited commercial experience and available evidence of fair value 
as a result  we defer recognition of product and service revenue and recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the contractual service period  which is generally for periods of twelve to thirty months  or over the anticipated service period if expected to exceed the contractual service period 
in these instances when it is anticipated that the actual service period will exceed the contractual service period  the accretion of the deferred product and service revenue may not begin until the installation of the unit and will continue through the expected service period 
the costs associated with the product  service and other obligations are expensed as they are incurred 
as we gain commercial experience  including field experience relative to service and warranty based on the sales of our initial products  the fair values for the multiple elements within our future contracts may become determinable and we may  in future periods  recognize revenue upon delivery of the product or we may continue to defer recognition  based on application of appropriate guidance within eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or changes in the manner in which we structure contractual agreements  including our agreements with distribution partners 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible  long lived assets and goodwill  if any  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and  for goodwill  at least annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to historical expectations or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets  long lived assets or goodwill  if any  may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based upon the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as appropriate 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on the review during the year ended december   we do not believe that there were any triggering events or that an impairment charge is required 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
included in this assessment is the determination of the net operating loss carry forward that has resulted from our cumulative net operating loss since inception 
these differences  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  result in a net deferred tax asset 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or forego a benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
under section of the internal revenue code irc  the use of loss carryforwards may be limited if a change in ownership of a company  as defined by the irc  occurs 
the company has determined that due to transactions involving the company s shares by significant shareholders  a change of ownership has occurred under the provisions of irc section as a result of this change of ownership  the usage of a portion  which may be substantial  of the net operating loss amounts  has become limited 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of this limitation 
once determined  the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss and an equivalent amount of valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and credits which may be carried forward  before they expire 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the recorded valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our net deferred tax assets have been offset in full by a valuation allowance 
as a result  the net provision for income taxes is zero for the year ended december  
table of contents stock based compensation our adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  in the first quarter of required that we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of share based instruments in the statement of operations 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon a blend of implied volatility ie management s expectation of volatility and the company s actual historic stock prices over the expected life of the options  which represents the company s best estimate of expected volatility 
expected option life the company s estimate of an expected option life was calculated in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin no 
sab simplified method for calculating the expected term assumption 
the simplified method is a calculation based on the contractual life of the associated options 
the company will be required to utilize actual historical data to determine the expected option life beginning in risk free interest rate we used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we reviewed historical forfeiture data and determined the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data 
we will re evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  we will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that the company recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  or sfas  which requires the recognition of the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in a company s balance sheet 
this portion of the new guidance is effective on december  additionally  the pronouncement eliminates the option for companies to use a measurement date prior to their fiscal year end effective december  the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
this new standard establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards that permit  or in some cases require  estimates of fair market value 
sfas no 
also expands financial statement disclosure requirements about a company s use of fair value measurements  including the effect of such measures on earnings 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our product development activities  ability to commercialize our on site energy products  market acceptance of our systems and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our development programs directed at commercializing our on site energy products for worldwide use  hiring and training our production staff  develop and expand our manufacturing capacity and continue expanding our production and our research and development activities 
we expect to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  issuance of additional equity or debt securities or additional borrowings subject to market and other conditions 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods

under the new agreement  the company and ge through its global research unit have agreed to collaborate on programs including but not limited to development of tools  materials and components that can be applied to various types of fuel cell products 
the specific programs to be undertaken under the agreement  and the detailed terms and conditions thereof  remain subject to agreement by both parties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in government  government backed and interest bearing investment grade securities that we generally hold for the duration of the term of the respective instrument 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a portion of the company s total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term inter company transactions with our foreign 
table of contents subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  the company s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  the company s results can be materially affected 
in addition  the company may source inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts
