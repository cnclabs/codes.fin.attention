the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
the event that had the most significant earnings impact in  and the main reason for the significant earnings increase over  was the company s sale of seci  seneca s wholly owned subsidiary that operated in canada 
seci was engaged in the exploration for  and the development and purchase of  natural gas and oil reserves in the provinces of alberta  saskatchewan and british columbia in canada 
this sale resulted in a million gain  net of tax 
the decision to sell seci was based on lower than expected returns from the canadian oil and gas properties combined with difficulty in finding significant new reserves 
as a result of the decision to sell seci  the company began presenting all seci operations as discontinued operations in september also contributing to the increase in earnings over was the non recurrence of impairment charges of million related to the exploration and production segment s canadian oil and gas assets recognized during under the full cost method of accounting  which is discussed below under critical accounting estimates 
seneca intends to continue its exploration and development activities in the gulf of mexico  in california and in appalachia  subject to regular re evaluation of its efforts and opportunities in each region 
the company spent million on capital expenditures related to continuing operations during  with approximately being spent in the exploration and production segment 
this was in line with the company s expectations 
as mentioned above  seneca will continue its exploration and development activities in appalachia  in california and in the gulf of mexico 
in appalachia  drilling will be accelerated 
seneca intends to commence drilling of wells for shallow tight sand targets in fiscal  a increase over the such wells drilled in in addition  seneca anticipates continued drilling in the deeper marcellus shale formation in appalachia with its joint venture partner  eog resources  inc seneca expects that as many as eighteen marcellus shale wells will be drilled on its acreage in  ten of which are expected to be horizontal wells 
in the gulf of mexico  seneca s strategy will be to follow a focused drilling plan in the specific areas where the company has expertise and past success 
the company took a significant step forward this year regarding the empire connector project 
in june  empire signed a firm transportation service agreement with keyspan gas east corporation  thereby obligating empire to provide transportation service that will require construction of the empire connector project 
construction of the empire connector began in september and miles will be completed by december the company expects to complete the project by november  the total cost to the company of the empire connector project is estimated at million  after giving effect to sales tax 
table of contents exemptions 
the company expects the expansion of the pipeline and storage segment to remain a major strategic priority 
supply corporation has verified that there is substantial market interest in transporting gas produced in the rocky mountain area to the northeast 
in order to serve this anticipated demand  supply corporation has proposed a new mile pipeline that would commence at clarington  ohio  the proposed terminus of the rockies express pipeline  and extend to the millennium pipeline under construction at corning  new york 
from corning  rocky mountain gas will be able to get to the new york city area and to new england 
the proposed pipeline would be designed to move approximately to mdth of gas per day  as well as accommodate volumes from local production areas 
these projects are discussed further in the capital resources and liquidity and rates and regulatory matters sections that follow 
the company is currently evaluating the appropriateness of establishing a master limited partnership mlp for its pipeline and storage assets  and another mlp for certain of its exploration and production assets 
if this evaluation determined that the mlp structure is sound and in the shareholders interest  the company would pursue the mlp structure for the appropriate company assets 
potential impediments to establishing mlps include a the low tax basis of our pipeline and storage assets  which substantially mitigates the tax advantages of an mlp structure  b the highly integrated operations of the company s pipeline and storage and utility business segments  and c the sustainability of an exploration and production mlp given the natural decline curve of production from all oil and gas properties 
as a result  new long lived reserves must be constantly added to an exploration and production mlp in order to sustain the mlp s cash distributions 
acquisitions of long lived reserves could be very costly given the significant premiums that are currently being paid for long lived reserves 
the company also began repurchasing outstanding shares of common stock during fiscal under a share repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors 
the program authorizes the company to repurchase up to an aggregate amount of million shares 
through september   the company had repurchased  shares for million under this program  including  shares for million during the year ended september  these matters are discussed further in the capital resources and liquidity section that follows 
on january   the company commenced a rate case in the new york jurisdiction of the utility segment by filing proposed tariff amendments and supporting testimony requesting approval to increase its annual revenues by million annually 
the company explained in the filing that its request for rate relief is necessitated by decreased revenues resulting from customer conservation efforts and increased customer uncollectibles  among other things 
the rate filing also includes a proposal for an aggressive efficiency and conservation initiative with a revenue decoupling mechanism designed to render the company indifferent to throughput reductions resulting from conservation 
in september  the nypsc issued an order approving the company s conservation program  and the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding issued a recommended decision  which recommends a rate increase designed to provide additional annual revenues of million as well as a bill surcharge that would collect up to million to recover expenses arising from the conservation program 
the recommended decision also recommends approval of the unopposed revenue decoupling mechanism 
the nypsc is not bound to accept the recommended decision 
this matter is discussed more fully in the rate and regulatory matters section that follows 
critical accounting estimates the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those estimates whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of accounting policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the 
table of contents company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company does not recognize any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired 
all costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the pool of capitalized costs being amortized 
in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test  which is performed each quarter  determines a limit  or ceiling  on a country by country basis on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net cash flows  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income tax effects related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
because of the decline in the price of natural gas during the third and fourth quarters of  the book value of the company s canadian oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling at both june  and september  consequently  seci recorded impairment charges of million million after tax in the third quarter of and million million after tax in the fourth quarter of these impairment charges are now included in the loss from discontinued operations for due to the sale of seci during it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 

table of contents upon the adoption of sfas on october   the company recorded an asset retirement obligation representing plugging and abandonment costs associated with the exploration and production segment s crude oil and natural gas wells and capitalized such costs in property  plant and equipment ie the full cost pool 
prior to the adoption of sfas  plugging and abandonment costs were accounted for solely through the company s units of production depletion calculation 
an estimate of such costs was added to the depletion base  which also included capitalized costs in the full cost pool and estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves 
with the adoption of sfas  plugging and abandonment costs are already included in capitalized costs and the units of production depletion calculation has been modified to exclude from the depletion base any estimate of future plugging and abandonment costs that are already recorded in the full cost pool 
prior to the adoption of sfas  in calculating the full cost ceiling  the company reduced the future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves by the estimated plugging and abandonment costs 
such future net cash flows would then be compared to capitalized costs in the full cost pool  with any excess capitalized costs being expensed 
with the adoption of sfas  since the full cost pool now includes an amount associated with plugging and abandoning the wells  the calculation of the full cost ceiling has been changed so that future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves are no longer reduced by the estimated plugging and abandonment costs 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to sfas  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note c regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment and all other category  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements  no cost collars and futures contracts 
the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  previously used an interest rate collar to limit interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company accounted for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
in  the company discontinued hedge accounting for the interest rate collar  which resulted in a gain being recognized 
gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective based on the effectiveness testing  mark to market gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be recognized in the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
as discussed below  the company was required to discontinue hedge accounting for a portion of its derivative financial instruments in the exploration and production segment  resulting in a charge to earnings in the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the fair values of the non exchange traded derivative financial instruments are based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section below for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 

table of contents pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
the discount rate used by the company is equal to the moody s aa long term corporate bond index  rounded to the nearest basis points 
the duration of the securities underlying that index approximately years reasonably matches the expected timing of anticipated future benefit payments approximately years 
the company also utilizes a yield curve model to determine the discount rate 
the yield curve is a spot rate yield curve that provides a zero coupon interest rate for each year into the future 
each year s anticipated benefit payments are discounted at the associated spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
the discount rate is then determined based on the spot interest rate that results in the same present value when applied to the same anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used by the company reflects the anticipated long term rate of return on the plan s current and future assets 
the company utilizes historical investment data  projected capital market conditions  and the plan s target asset class and investment manager allocations to set the assumption regarding the expected return on plan assets 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit costs for the utility and pipeline and storage segments represented and  respectively  of the company s total pension and post retirement benefit costs as determined under sfas and sfas for the years ended september  and changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could also have an impact on the benefit obligation and the funded status related to the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans and could impact the company s equity 
for example  while the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations did not change from to  the discount rate was changed from in to in the change in the discount rate from to reduced the pension plan projected benefit obligation by million and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
other examples include actual versus expected return on plan assets  which has an impact on the funded status of the plans  and actual versus expected benefit payments  which has an impact on the pension plan projected benefit obligations and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for the post retirement plan 
for  actual versus expected return on plan assets resulted in an increase to the funded status of the retirement plan and the post retirement plan of million and million  respectively 
the actual versus expected benefit payments for caused a decrease of million and million to the projected benefit obligation and accumulated post retirement benefit obligation  respectively 
in calculating the projected benefit obligation for the retirement plan and the accumulated post retirement obligation for the post retirement plan  the actuary takes into account the average remaining service life of active participants 
the average remaining service life of active participants is years for both the retirement plan and the post retirement plan 
for further discussion of the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  refer to other matters in this item  which includes a discussion of funding for the current year and the adoption of sfas  and to item at note g retirement plan and other post retirement benefits

the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in compared with a loss of million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations of million is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production  utility  pipeline and storage  and energy marketing segments and the corporate and all other categories  slightly offset by lower earnings in the timber segment  as shown in the table below 
the increase in earnings from discontinued operations primarily resulted from the gain on the sale of seci recognized in as well as the non recurrence of million of impairment charges recognized in related to the exploration and production segment s canadian oil and gas assets 
in the discussion that follows  note that all amounts used in the earnings discussions are after tax amounts  unless otherwise noted 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by several events in and  including events a million gain on the sale of seci  which was completed in august this amount is included in earnings from discontinued operations  a million benefit to earnings in the pipeline and storage segment due to the reversal of a reserve established for all costs incurred related to the empire connector project recognized during june a million benefit to earnings in the pipeline and storage segment associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar  and a million benefit to earnings in the energy marketing segment related to the resolution of a purchased gas contingency

this decrease was primarily offset by a million increase in transportation revenues and a million increase in off system sales revenues 

table of contents the decrease in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of lower gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  which more than offset the revenue impact of higher retail sales volumes  as shown in the table above 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
this decrease was offset slightly by a base rate increase in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  effective january  which increased operating revenues by million for the increase is included within both retail and transportation revenues in the table above 
the increase in transportation revenues was primarily due to a bcf increase in transportation throughput  largely due to the migration of retail sales customers to transportation service 
the corresponding million increase in transportation revenues would have been greater if not for a million out of period adjustment recorded in the first quarter of to correct distribution corporation s calculation of the symmetrical sharing component of new york s gas adjustment rate 
as reported in  on november  the us court of appeals vacated and remanded ferc s order no 
 its latest affiliate standards of conduct  with respect to natural gas pipelines 
the court s decision became effective on january   and on january   ferc issued order no 
 its interim rule  designed to respond to the court s decision 
in order no 
 as clarified by ferc on march   the ferc readopted  on an interim basis  certain provisions that existed prior to the issuance of order no 
that had made it possible for the utility to engage in certain off system sales without triggering the adverse consequences that would otherwise arise under the standards of conduct 
as such  the utility resumed engaging in off system sales on non affiliated pipelines as of may  resulting in total off system sales revenues of million for due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to margins in compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this increase largely resulted from a million increase in retail gas sales revenues 
transportation revenues and other revenues also increased by million and million  respectively 
the increase in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  which more than offset the revenue impact of lower retail sales volumes  as shown in the table above 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
warmer weather  as shown in the table above  and greater conservation by customers due to higher natural gas commodity prices  were the principal reasons for the decrease in retail sales volumes 
the increase in transportation revenues was primarily due to a million increase in the new york jurisdiction s calculation of the symmetrical sharing component of the gas adjustment rate 
the symmetrical sharing component is a mechanism included in distribution corporation s new york rate agreement that shares with customers of the difference between actual revenues received from large volume customers and the level of revenues that were projected to be received during the rate year 
of the million increase  million was due to an out of period adjustment recorded in fiscal year when it was determined that certain credits that had been included in the calculation should have been removed during the implementation of a previous rate case 
the adjustment related to fiscal years through the impact of the august new york rate agreement was to increase operating revenues by million of which million was an increase to other operating revenues 
this increase consisted of a base rate increase  the implementation of a merchant function charge  the elimination of certain bill credits  and the elimination of the gross receipts tax surcharge 
the rate agreement also allowed distribution corporation to continue to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve  which increased other operating revenues  to recover previous under collections of pension and post retirement expenses 
the impact of that increase in other operating revenues was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense thus there was no earnings impact 
distribution corporation did not record any entries involving the cost mitigation reserve 
table of contents in other operating revenues were also impacted by two out of period regulatory adjustments recorded during the first adjustment related to the final settlement with the staff of the nypsc of the earnings sharing liability for the to time period 
as a result of that settlement  the new york rate jurisdiction recorded additional earnings sharing expense as an offset to other operating revenues of million 
the second adjustment related to a regulatory liability recorded for previous over collections of new york state gross receipts tax 
in preparing for the implementation of the rate agreement in new york  the company determined that it needed to adjust that regulatory liability by million of which million was recorded as a reduction of other operating revenues and million was recorded as additional interest expense related to fiscal years and prior 
these adjustments did not recur in in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  the impact of the base rate increase  which became effective in mid april  was to increase operating revenues by million 
this increase is included within both retail and transportation revenues in the table above 
purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per mcf in  a decrease of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings decreased by million 
this was primarily due to lower interest income million 
the new york division s current rate agreement with the nypsc allows the company to accrue interest on a pension related regulatory asset 
the amount of interest that can be accrued is reduced as the funded status of the pension plan improves 
the fair market value of the pension plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation at september  resulting in a significant reduction in the interest accrual on this regulatory asset 
the out of period symmetrical sharing adjustment discussed above million  higher bad debt and other operating costs million  higher property taxes million and higher interest expense million also contributed to this decrease 
the positive impact associated with a lower effective tax rate million and increased usage per account million partially offset the overall decrease 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to a base rate increase million that became effective january  colder weather million  and the positive impact associated with a lower effective tax rate million 
higher intercompany and other interest expense million  coupled with a decrease in normalized usage million  partially offset these increases 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the 
table of contents utility segment s new york customers 
in and  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million and million  respectively  as the weather was warmer than normal 
compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings increased by million  primarily due to the positive impact of the rate agreement in this jurisdiction that became effective august million 
in addition  the increase in the new york jurisdiction s calculation of the symmetrical sharing component of the gas adjustment rate  including the out of period adjustment discussed above  contributed million to earnings 
two out of period regulatory adjustments recorded during fiscal year that did not recur during  as discussed above  also contributed an additional million to earnings 
the first adjustment  related to the final settlement with the staff of the nypsc of the earnings sharing liability for the fiscal through time period  increased earnings in fiscal by million 
the second adjustment  related to a regulatory liability recorded for previous over collections of new york state gross receipts tax  increased earnings in fiscal by million 
the increase in earnings due to the new york rate agreement  the symmetrical sharing component of the gas adjustment rate  and the two out of period regulatory adjustments recorded in  was partially offset by a decline in margin associated with lower weather normalized usage by customers million  higher operation expenses million  higher interest expense million  and a higher effective income tax rate million 
the higher effective income tax rate is due to positive tax adjustments recorded in that did not recur in the increase in operation expenses consisted primarily of higher pension expense offset by lower bad debt expense 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million  due to the positive impact of the rate case settlement in this jurisdiction that became effective april million  and lower operation expenses million 
the decrease in operation expenses consisted primarily of lower bad debt expense offset partially by higher pension expense 
these increases to earnings were partially offset by the impact of warmer than normal weather in pennsylvania million  lower weather normalized usage by customer million  higher interest expense million  and a higher effective tax rate million 
the decrease in bad debt expense reflects the fact that in the fourth quarter of  the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions increased the allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect the increase in final billed account balances and the increased aging of outstanding active receivables heading into the heating season 
a similar adjustment was not required in in  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million because it was warmer than normal in the new york service territory 
in  the wnc did not have a significant impact on earnings

the decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a million decrease in efficiency gas revenues 
this decrease was due to the company s recent settlement with the ferc  which decreased efficiency gas retainage allowances 
offsetting this decrease  there was a million increase in other revenues attributable to the lease termination fee adjustment in an intercompany transaction for the company s former headquarters  which did not recur in while supply corporation s transportation volumes decreased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with this decrease consisted of a million decrease in other revenues offset by a million increase in firm and interruptible transportation revenues and a million increase in firm and interruptible storage service revenues 
the decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a million decrease in efficiency gas revenues due to lower natural gas prices  a million decrease in cashout revenues  and a million decrease in revenue attributable to a lease termination fee adjustment an intercompany transaction for the company s former headquarters 
cashout revenues are completely offset by purchased gas expense 
the increase in firm and interruptible transportation revenues is due to additional contracts with customers and the renewal of contracts at higher rates  both of which reflect the increased demand for transportation services due to market conditions resulting from the effects of hurricane damage to production and pipeline infrastructure in the gulf of mexico during the fall of while supply corporation s transportation volumes increased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply 
table of contents corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
the increase in storage revenues reflects the renewal of storage contracts at higher rates 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the main factor contributing to this increase was the reversal of a reserve for preliminary survey costs million related to the empire connector project 
based on the signing of a service agreement with keyspan gas east corporation during the quarter ended june   management determined that it was probable that the project would go forward and that such preliminary survey costs were properly capitalizable in accordance with the ferc s uniform system of accounts and sfas in addition  there was a million increase in earnings associated with the decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the most recent settlement with the ferc  which reduced depreciation rates 
there was also a million positive earnings impact associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar 
on december   empire repaid million of secured debt 
the interest costs of this secured debt were hedged by the interest rate collar 
since the hedged transaction was settled and there will be no future cash flows associated with the secured debt  the unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the interest rate collar was reclassified to the income statement 
these earnings increases were offset by higher interest expense million  lower efficiency gas revenues million  a million increase in operating costs primarily post retirement benefit costs  and the earnings decrease associated with a higher effective tax rate million 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease reflects the non recurrence of two events  a million gain on a ferc approved sale of base gas in and a million gain associated with insurance proceeds received in prior years for which a contingency was resolved in both of these items were recorded in other income 
it also reflects the earnings impact associated with lower efficiency gas revenues million and higher operation expenses million 
these earnings decreases were offset by the positive earnings impact of higher transportation and storage revenues million  lower depreciation due to the non recurrence of a write down of the company s former corporate office in million  and the earnings benefit associated with a lower effective tax rate million

table of contents compared with operating revenues from continuing operations for the exploration and production segment increased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging increased million due primarily to an per barrel increase in weighted average prices after hedging  which more than offset a slight decrease in oil production of  barrels 
gas production revenue after hedging increased million in as compared with an increase in gas production of  mmcf and an increase in weighted average prices after hedging of per mcf both contributed to the increase 
the increase in gas production occurred primarily in the gulf coast region  mmcf 
during the quarter ended december   seneca experienced significant production delays due largely to the impact of hurricane damage to pipeline infrastructure in the gulf of mexico 
seneca had substantially all of its pre hurricane gulf of mexico production back on line at the beginning of fiscal production also increased in this segment s appalachian region mmcf  primarily due to increased drilling in this region during  as highlighted in item under exploration and production activities 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues from continuing operations for the exploration and production segment increased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging increased million due primarily to higher weighted average prices after hedging per barrel 
this increase was offset slightly by a decrease in production  barrels 
gas production revenue after hedging decreased million 
a decrease in gas production  mmcf more than offset an increase in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf 
the decrease in gas production occurred primarily in the gulf coast a  mmcf decline  which is partly attributable to the fall hurricane damage and partly attributable to the expected decline rates for the company s production in the region 
other revenues increased million largely due to the non recurrence of a million mark to market adjustment  recorded in  for losses on certain derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified as effective hedges due to the anticipated delays in oil and gas production volumes caused by hurricane rita 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings from continuing operations for were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings from continuing operations of million for higher crude oil prices  higher natural gas production and higher natural gas prices increased earnings by million  million and million  respectively 
these increases were partly offset by the non recurrence of million of tax benefits recognized during  discussed below  as well as by higher depletion expense and higher lease operating expense of million and million  respectively 
slightly lower crude oil production and higher general and administrative expenses also decreased earnings by million and million  respectively 
earnings were also negatively impacted by a higher effective tax rate million 
compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings from continuing operations in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings from continuing operations of million in the increase is primarily the result of higher oil and gas prices  which increased earnings by million and million  respectively 
also  the non recurrence of the mark to market adjustment discussed under revenues above  contributed million to earnings and strong cash flow provided higher interest 
table of contents income million 
in the third quarter of  a million benefit to earnings related to income taxes was recognized 
the company reversed a valuation allowance million associated with the capital loss carryforward that resulted from the sale of certain of seneca s oil properties  and also recognized a tax benefit of million related to the favorable resolution of certain open tax issues 
partly offsetting these increases  lower gas and oil production decreased earnings by million and million  respectively 
further contributing to the decrease were higher general and administrative and other operating costs million and higher lease operating expenses million 
the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily in the west coast region due to higher steaming costs associated with heavy crude oil production in the california midway sunset and north lost hills fields 
the higher steaming costs were due to an increase in the price for natural gas purchased in the field and used in the steaming operations  primarily in the second quarter of fiscal  compared to the second quarter of fiscal energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease primarily reflects lower gas sales revenue due to a decrease in natural gas commodity prices for the period that were recovered through revenues  offset in part by an increase in throughput 
the increase in throughput was due to the addition of certain large  low margin commercial and industrial customers  an increase in sales to wholesale customers  and colder weather 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in as compared with the increase primarily reflects higher natural gas commodity prices that were recovered through revenues  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in throughput 
the increase in throughput was due to the addition of certain large commercial and industrial customers  which more than offset any decrease in throughput due to warmer weather and greater conservation by customers due to higher natural gas prices 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in higher margins of million are responsible for the increase in earnings 
the increase in margin is mainly the result of a million reversal of an accrual for purchased gas expense related to the resolution of a contingency during while throughput increased  as noted above  much of this increase in volume is related to sales to low margin customers 

table of contents compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in despite warmer weather and greater conservation by customers  gross margin increased due to a number of factors  including higher volumes and the marketing flexibility associated with stored gas 
the energy marketing segment s contracts for significant storage and transportation volumes provided operational flexibility resulting in increased sales throughput and earnings 
the increase in gross margin more than offset an increase in operation expense 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dried lumber sales other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dried lumber sales compared with operating revenues for the timber segment decreased million in as compared with this decrease is attributed to unfavorable weather conditions primarily during the fall of and the spring of that greatly limited the harvesting of logs 
these conditions consisted of warm  wet weather that made it difficult to bring logging trucks into the forests 
weather conditions were significantly more favorable throughout fiscal these unfavorable conditions for harvesting resulted in a decline in log sales of million or  board feet 
there was also a decline in both green lumber and kiln dried lumber sales of million and million  respectively  primarily because there were fewer logs available for processing 
declines in market prices for the cherry and maple species also contributed to the decrease in green lumber and kiln dried lumber sales 
additionally  the processing of a greater amount of lumber species other than cherry due to the mix of species on the areas being harvested contributed to the decline in kiln dried lumber sales since lumber species other than cherry are sold at a lower price than kiln dried cherry lumber 
with the addition of two new kilns placed into service in june that allow for greater processing capacity  the company plans to continue to focus on increasing cherry kiln dried lumber sales since cherry kiln dried lumber commands a higher price in the overall mix of lumber 
offsetting the decreases discussed above  other revenues increased million largely due to the sale of million board feet of timber rights million 

table of contents compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in as compared with this increase is attributed to an increase in kiln dried lumber sales of million primarily due to an increase in kiln dried cherry lumber sales volumes of million board feet 
other kiln dried lumber sales volumes decreased by million board feet  but there was little impact to revenues 
the addition of two new kilns in february allowed for greater processing capacity in as compared to since the kilns were in operation for all of higher log sales revenue of million also contributed to the increase in revenues 
an increase in cherry export log sales as a result of greater market demand and an increase in saw log sales were the primary factors contributing to the increase 
offsetting these increases was a decline in cherry veneer log sales due to lower volumes of cherry veneer logs harvested because of unfavorable weather conditions 
earnings compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease was primarily due to lower margins from lumber and log sales million as a result of the decline in revenues noted above  as well as higher general and administrative expenses of million 
partially offsetting this decrease was a decline in depletion expense of million 
the decrease in depletion expense reflects the cutting of more low cost or no cost basis timber from company owned land as well as the overall decrease in logs harvested 
compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in higher margins from kiln dried lumber sales and cherry export log sales accounted for the earnings increase 
all other and corporate operations all other and corporate operations primarily includes the operations of horizon lfg  horizon power  former international segment activity other than the activity from the czech republic operations  and corporate operations 
horizon lfg owns and operates short distance landfill gas pipeline companies 
horizon power s activity primarily consists of equity method investments in seneca energy  model city and esne 
horizon power has a ownership interest in each of these entities 
the income from these equity method investments is reported as income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of income 
seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
esne generates electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
horizon power also owns a gas powered turbine and other assets which it had planned to use in the development of a co generation plant 
the company is in the process of selling these assets 
the former international segment activity primarily consists of project development activities in italy and bulgaria 
earnings compared with all other and corporate operations had earnings of million in  an increase of million compared with earnings of million for this improvement was largely due to an increase in interest income of million primarily intercompany interest 
in the all other category  horizon lfg s earnings benefited from higher margins of million in as compared to  and horizon power s income from unconsolidated subsidiaries increased million  also contributing to the increase in earnings 
the corporate and all other categories also had an earnings benefit associated with a lower effective tax rate million 

table of contents compared with all other and corporate operations experienced income of million in  which was million greater than a loss of million in the increase is due primarily to the non recurrence of million of impairment charges recorded in during  horizon power recorded a million impairment in the value of its investment in esne 
management determined that there was a decline in the fair market value of esne that was other than temporary in nature given continuing high commodity prices for natural gas and the negative impact these prices had on operations 
the company also recorded a million impairment of the gas powered turbine mentioned above 
this impairment was based on a review of current market prices for similar turbines 
also contributing to the increase were higher interest income million during  resulting primarily from the investment of proceeds from the sale of ue in july  combined with higher average interest rates in versus these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses million and lower margins on landfill gas sales million 
interest income interest income was million lower in as compared to as discussed in the utility earnings section above  the main reason for this decrease was lower interest income of million on a pension related regulatory asset in accordance with the new york rate agreement 
the new york division s rate agreement with the nypsc allows the company to accrue interest on a pension related regulatory asset 
the amount of the interest that can be accrued is reduced as the funded status of the pension plan improves 
the fair market value of the pension plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation at september  resulting in a significant reduction in the interest accrual related to this regulatory asset in interest income was million higher in as compared to as discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the main reasons for this increase were strong cash flow from operations  the investment of proceeds from the sale of ue in july and higher average annual interest rates 
additionally  interest income on a pension related regulatory asset in accordance with the new york rate agreement increased by million 
other income other income was million higher in as compared to the increase is attributed to a death benefit gain on life insurance proceeds of million recognized in the corporate category 
other income was million lower in as compared to as discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the main reasons for this decrease included non recurring gains recorded during in the pipeline and storage segment related to the sale of base gas million  and the disposition of insurance proceeds million received in prior years for which a contingency was resolved 
interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt decreased million in and million in the decrease in was primarily the result of a lower average amount of long term debt outstanding 
in addition  the company recognized a million benefit to interest expense as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar  as discussed above under pipeline and storage 
the underlying long term debt associated with this interest rate collar was repaid in december and the unrealized gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the interest rate collar was reclassified to interest expense during the quarter ended december  other interest charges were million higher in and million lower in the decrease in resulted primarily from the non recurrence of million of interest expense recorded by the utility segment in and a lower average amount of short term debt outstanding during the million of interest expense recorded in related to an adjustment to a regulatory liability for previous over collections of new york state gross receipts tax

cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather may also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements  no cost collars and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in higher working capital requirements in the exploration and production  utility  and pipeline and storage segments were partially offset by lower working capital requirements in the energy marketing segment

it also reflects million of costs related to the empire connector project that were added to construction work in progress during the empire connector project is discussed below under estimated capital expenditures 
exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the gulf coast region million for the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
the significant amount spent in the gulf coast region is related to high commodity prices  which has improved the economics of investment in the area  plus projected royalty relief 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
timber the majority of the timber segment capital expenditures were for the construction of two new kilns that were placed into service during the quarter ended june   as well as construction of a lumber sorter for highland s sawmill operations  which was placed into service in october all other and corporate the majority of the all other and corporate category expenditures for long lived assets consisted of a million capital contribution to seneca energy by horizon power  million in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal seneca energy generates and sells electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties

other capital expenditures will be concentrated in the replacement of transmission and storage lines  reconditioning of storage wells and improvements of compressor stations 
the company continues to explore various opportunities to expand its capabilities to transport gas to the east coast  either through the supply corporation or empire systems or in partnership with others 
in october  empire filed an application with the ferc for the authority to build and operate the empire connector project to expand its natural gas pipeline operations to serve new markets in new york and elsewhere in the northeast by extending the empire pipeline 
the application also asked that empire s existing business and facilities be brought under ferc jurisdiction  and that the ferc approve rates for empire s existing and proposed services 
the empire connector will provide an upstream supply link for the millennium pipeline  which began construction in june  and will transport canadian and other natural gas supplies to downstream customers 
the empire connector is designed to move up to approximately mdth of natural gas per day 
on december   the ferc issued an order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the empire connector and various other related pipeline projects by other unaffiliated companies  which has been accepted by empire and the other applicants 
in june  empire and keyspan gas east corporation keyspan executed a binding firm transportation service agreement for mdth per day  obligating empire to provide transportation service that will require construction of the empire connector project 
construction of the empire connector began in september and the planned in service date is november refer to the rate and regulatory matters section that follows for further discussion of this matter 
the forecasted expenditures for this project over the next two years are as follows million in and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above

as of september   the company had incurred approximately million in costs related to this project 
of this amount  million  million and million were incurred during the years ended september   and  respectively 
during the quarter ended june   the company reversed the reserve established for these costs  as discussed above under results of operations  following the execution of the keyspan service agreement 
as of september   all of the costs incurred to date related to this project have been capitalized as either construction work in progress million or materials and supplies inventory million  as per the accounting guidance in the ferc s uniform system of accounts and sfas 
table of contents supply corporation continues to view its potential tuscarora extension project as an important link to millennium and potential storage development in the corning  new york area 
this new pipeline  which would expand the supply corporation system from its tuscarora storage field to the intersection of the proposed millennium and empire connector pipelines  could be designed initially to transport up to approximately mdth of natural gas per day 
it may also provide supply corporation with the opportunity to increase the deliverability of the existing tuscarora storage field 
supply corporation is also developing a project to meet the results of an open season seeking customers for new capacity from the rockies express project  appalachian production  storage and other points to leidy and to interconnections with millennium and empire at corning 
this new project the west to east project could include the tuscarora extension  or could be a second phase following the development of that project 
the timeline of both of these projects depends on market development  and should the market mature  the company anticipates financing the tuscarora extension with cash on hand and or through the use of the company s lines of credit 
the capital cost of the west to east project could amount to million  which would be financed by a combination of debt and equity 
there have been no costs incurred by the company related to either project as of september   and the forecasted expenditures for the tuscarora extension project over the next three years are as follows in  million in  and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above

the company has not yet filed an application with the ferc for the authority to build either project 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the gulf coast region million on the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
estimated capital expenditures in in the timber segment will be concentrated on the purchase of new equipment  vehicles and improvements to facilities for this segment s lumber yard  sawmill and kiln operations 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations  partnerships and other business entities 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or natural gas storage facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow the company did not have any outstanding short term notes payable to banks or commercial paper at september  however  the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  margin calls on derivative financial instruments  exploration and development expenditures  repurchases of stock  and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
as for bank loans  the company maintains a number of individual uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under these lines of credit are made at competitive market rates

new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
if a tax benefit meets this threshold  it is measured and recognized based on an analysis of the cumulative probability of the tax benefit being ultimately sustained 
the cumulative effect of applying fin at adoption  if any  is reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption 
fin is effective for the first quarter of the company s fiscal year and it is expected that this pronouncement will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the pronouncement serves to clarify the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements

the pronouncement also specifies that a plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status be measured as of the end of company s fiscal year  with limited exceptions 
under sfas  certain previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and previously unrecognized prior service costs for both the pension and other post retirement benefit plans as well as a previously unrecognized transition obligation for the other post retirement benefit plan are required to be recognized 
these amounts were not required to be recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet before the adoption of sfas  but were instead amortized over a period of time 
in accordance with sfas  the company has recognized the funded status of its benefit plans and implemented the disclosure requirements of sfas at september  the requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the company s fiscal year end date will be adopted by the company by the end of fiscal currently  the company measures its plan assets and benefit obligations using a june th measurement date
