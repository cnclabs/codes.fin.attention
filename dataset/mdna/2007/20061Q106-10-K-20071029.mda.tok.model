item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we are an independent marketer of electricity and natural gas to end user customers 
as of july   we provided retail electricity and natural gas to residential  commercial  industrial and institutional customers in ten states 
our principal operating subsidiary  commerce energy  inc  is licensed by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  and by state regulatory agencies as an unregulated retail marketer of natural gas and electricity 
we were founded in as a retail electricity marketer in california 
as of july   we supplied electricity to approximately  customers in california  maryland  michigan  new jersey  pennsylvania and texas  and natural gas to approximately  customers in california  florida  georgia  maryland  nevada  ohio and pennsylvania 
the electricity and natural gas we sell to our customers is purchased from third party suppliers under both short term and long term contracts 
we do not own electricity generation or transmission facilities  natural gas producing properties or pipelines 
the electricity and natural gas we sell is generally metered and delivered to our customers by local utilities 
the local utilities also provide billing and collection services for many of our customers on our behalf 
additionally  to facilitate load shaping and demand balancing for our customers  we buy and sell surplus electricity and natural gas from and to other market participants when necessary 
we utilize third party facilities for the storage of our natural gas 
the growth of our retail business depends upon a number of factors  including the degree of deregulation in each state  our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers and our ability to acquire energy for our customers at competitive prices and on favorable credit terms 
apx settlement on january   apx  we and certain other parties signed an apx settlement and release of claims agreement  or the apx settlement agreement  which among other things  established a mechanism for allocating refunds owed to apx and resolved certain other matters and claims related to apx s participation in the px and caiso centralized spot markets for wholesale electricity from may  through june  under the apx settlement agreement  commerce and certain other parties were entitled to receive payments from apx  with commerce expected to receive up to approximately million 
subsequently  in april  we received a payment of million and the remaining settlement payment of million in august hesco customer acquisition effective september   the company acquired from houston energy services company  llc  or hesco certain assets consisting principally of contracts with end use customers in california  florida  nevada  kentucky and texas consuming approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas annually 
the acquisition price of approximately million in cash and million in assumption of liabilities was allocated to customer contracts and is being amortized over an estimated life of four years 
acn energy transaction on february   we acquired certain assets of acn utility services  inc or acnu  a subsidiary of american communications network  inc or acn  and its retail electricity business in texas and pennsylvania and its retail natural gas business in california  georgia  maryland  new york  ohio and pennsylvania 
the aggregate 
table of contents purchase price was million in cash and  shares of our common stock  valued at million 
the common stock payment was contingent upon acn meeting certain sales requirements during the year following the acquisition date 
these sales requirements were not met and the shares were cancelled in april as a result  both goodwill and common stock were reduced by million 
we refer to this acquisition as the acn energy transaction and the assets acquired as the acn energy assets 
acn energy assets included approximately  residential and small commercial customers  natural gas inventory associated with utility and pipeline storage and transportation agreements and natural gas and electricity supply  scheduling and capacity contracts  software and other infrastructure 
no cash or accounts receivables were acquired in the transaction and none of acnu s legal liabilities were assumed 
the acn energy assets purchased and the operating results generated from the acn energy transaction have been included in our operations as of february   the effective date of the acquisition 
market and regulatory as of july   we served electricity and gas customers in states  operating within the jurisdictional territory of different local utilities or ldcs 
among other things  tariff filings by these ldcs for changes in their allowed billing rate to their customers in the markets in which we operate  significantly impact the viability of our sales and marketing plans and our overall operating and financial results 
although regulatory requirements are determined by each state jurisdiction  and administered and monitored by state regulatory commissions  typically known as the puc  operating rules and rate filings for each ldc even within the same state  are unique 
accordingly  we generally treat each ldc distribution territory as a distinct market 
electricity as of july   we marketed electricity in ldc markets within the states of california  maryland  michigan  new jersey  pennsylvania  and texas 
on april   we began supplying customers in california with electricity as an electric service provider  or esp 
on september   the california public utility commission  or cpuc  issued a ruling suspending the right of direct access  which allowed electricity customers to buy their power from a supplier other than the electric utilities 
this suspension  although permitting us to keep current direct access customers and to solicit direct access customers served by other esps  prohibits us from soliciting new non direct access customers indefinitely 
currently  several important rules are under review by the cpuc  including the resource adequacy requirement and the renewable portfolio standard 
additional costs to serve customers in california are anticipated from these proceedings  however  the cpuc decisions will determine the allocation of costs across all market participants 
we cannot currently estimate the impact that these issues and anticipated additional costs may have on our future financial results 
in connection with ferc s determination of the amounts of refunds due to california energy buyers for purchases made in the spot markets operated by the caiso and the california px during the period october  through june   referred to as the refund period  ferc has issued dozens of orders  most of which have been taken up on appeal before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
two of the cases  lockyer v 
ferc and cpuc v 
ferc each present issues which may have an adverse financial impact upon us  however  at this time  we are unable to predict either the outcome of the proceedings or the ultimate financial effect on us 
lockyer v 
ferc 
on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision on the california attorney general s challenge to the validity of ferc s market based rate system 
this case was originally presented to ferc upon complaint that the adoption and implementation of market based rate authority was flawed 
ferc dismissed the complaint after sellers refiled reports of sales in the caiso and the california px spot markets and bilateral sales to california department of water resources during and the ninth circuit upheld ferc s authority to authorize sales of electric energy at market based rates  but found that the requirement that sales at market based rates be reported quarterly to ferc for individual transactions is integral to a market based rate regime 
the state of california  among others  has publicly interpreted the decision as providing authority to ferc to order refunds for different time frames and based on different rationales than are currently pending in the 
table of contents california refund proceedings  discussed in the immediately proceeding paragraph the decision remands to ferc the question of whether  and in what circumstances  to impose refunds or other remedies for any alleged failure to report sales transactions to ferc 
on december   several energy sellers filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the us supreme court 
the us supreme court denied the petition 
we cannot predict the scope or nature of  or ultimate resolution of this case 
cpuc v 
ferc 
on august   after reviewing certain ferc decisions in the california refund proceedings  the ninth circuit decided that ferc erred in excluding potential relief for alleged tariff violations related to transactions in the caiso and the california px markets for periods that pre dated october  and additionally ruled that ferc should consider remedies for certain bilateral transactions with the california department of water resources previously considered outside the scope of the proceedings 
the decision may expose commerce to claims or liabilities for transactions outside the previously defined refund period 
at this time  the ultimate financial outcome for us is unclear 
there are proceedings and cases in other states in which we sell electricity  that could impact our financial results  but we are actively engaged in advocacy or coalition groups to mitigate any adverse policy outcomes 
natural gas as of july   we marketed natural gas in ldc markets within the seven states of california  florida  georgia  maryland  nevada  ohio and pennsylvania 
due to significant increases in the price of natural gas  a number of ldcs have filed or communicated expectations of filing for approval of rate increases to their customers 
although the impact of these filings cannot currently be estimated  they are not anticipated to adversely impact our financial results 
in  natural gas choice programs began in ohio 
we provide gas service to residential and small commercial customers in the dominion east ohio  or deo  and columbia gas of ohio service areas 
deo will exit the merchant function in ohio  and its plan was approved by the public utilities commission of ohio  or puco  earlier this year 
the plan was divided into two sections  phase i and phase ii 
in phase i  suppliers and marketers bid for supply only 
in phase ii  suppliers and marketers will bid to serve any bundled customers remaining with deo 
on august   deo conducted an auction for pricing of its natural gas wholesale supply of natural gas for the time period october through august the auction participants will bid a monthly retail price adjustment to be added to the monthly nymex settlement price 
the sum of these will become the standard offer service  or sos  price that will replace the current gas cost recovery  or gcr  rate 
the gcr rate has traditionally been calculated on a monthly basis using imbalances from prior months 
the new sos rate will more closely reflect true market costs 
it is expected that deo will be submitting an application to the puco by october  for phase ii

seasonal influences demand for electricity and natural gas is continually influenced by both seasonal and abnormal weather patterns 
to the extent that one or more of our markets experiences a period of unexpected weather  we may be required to either procure additional energy to service our customers or to sell surplus energy in the open market 
generally  unexpectedly higher or lower than normal energy demand from our customers increases the relative cost of our energy supplies 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are those that we consider to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

table of contents accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we purchase substantially all of our power and natural gas under forward physical delivery contracts for supply to our retail customers 
these forward physical delivery contracts are defined as commodity derivative contracts under statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
using the exemption available for qualifying contracts under sfas no 
 we apply the normal purchase and normal sale accounting treatment to a majority of our forward physical delivery contracts 
accordingly  we record revenue generated from customer sales as energy is delivered to our retail customers and the related energy cost under our forward physical delivery contracts is recorded as direct energy costs when received from our suppliers 
we use financial derivative instruments such as swaps  options and futures as an effective way of assisting in managing our price risk in energy supply procurement 
for forward or future contracts that do not meet the qualifying criteria for normal purchase  normal sale accounting treatment  we elect cash flow hedge accounting  where appropriate 
we also utilize other financial derivatives  primarily swaps  options and futures to hedge our commodity price risks 
certain derivative instruments  which are designated as economic hedges or as speculative  do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and require current period mark to market accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 with fair market value being used to determine the related income or expense that is recorded each quarter in the statement of operations 
as a result  the changes in fair value of derivatives that do not meet the requirements of normal purchase and normal sale accounting treatment or cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in operating income loss and as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
the subsequent changes in the fair value of these contracts could result in operating income loss volatility as the fair value of the changes are recorded on a net basis in direct energy costs in our consolidated statement of operations for each period 
as a result of a sale on january  of two significant electricity forward physical delivery contracts on a net cash settlement basis back to the original supplier  the normal purchase and normal sale exemption under sfas no 
was no longer available for our pennsylvania market pjm iso 
accordingly  for the period from february through july  we designated forward physical delivery contracts entered into for our pennsylvania electricity market as cash flow hedges  whereby market to market accounting gains or losses were deferred and reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss until the time of physical delivery 
effective august   the normal purchase and normal sale exemption has been reinstated for our pennsylvania market 
utility and independent system operator costs included in direct energy costs  along with the cost of energy that we purchase  are scheduling costs  independent system operator  or iso  fees  interstate pipeline costs and utility service charges 
the actual charges and certain energy costs are not finalized until subsequent settlement processes are performed for all distribution system participants 
prior to the completion of settlements which may take from one to several months  we estimate these costs based on historical trends and preliminary settlement information 
the historical trends and preliminary information may differ from actual information resulting in the need to adjust previous estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from non payment of customer billings 
if the financial conditions of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
net revenue and unbilled receivables our customers are billed monthly at various dates throughout the month 
unbilled receivables represent the estimated sale amount for power delivered to a customer at the end of a reporting period  but not yet billed 
unbilled receivables from sales are estimated based upon the amount of power delivered  but not yet billed  multiplied by the estimated sales price per unit 
inventory inventory consists of natural gas in storage as required by state regulators and contracted obligations under customer choice programs 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 

table of contents customer acquisition cost direct customer acquisition costs paid to third parties and directly related to specific new customers are deferred and amortized over the life of the initial customer contract  typically one year 
legal matters from time to time  we may be involved in litigation matters 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies and accrue for estimated losses on such matters in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
such additional expense could potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our activities expose us to a variety of market risks principally from the change in and volatility of commodity prices 
we have established risk management policies and procedures designed to manage these risks with a strong focus on the retail nature of our business and to reduce the potentially adverse effects these risks may have on our operating results 
our board of directors and the audit committee of the board oversee the risk management program  including the approval of risk management policies and procedures 
this program is predicated on a strong risk management focus combined with the establishment of an effective system of internal controls 
we have a risk oversight committee  or roc  that is responsible for establishing risk management policies  reviewing procedures for the identification  assessment  measurement and management of risks  and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures 
the roc is comprised of all key members of senior management and is chaired by the vice president  chief risk officer 

table of contents commodity risk management commodity price and volume risk arise from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity and natural gas  the volatility of commodity prices  and customer usage fluctuations due to changes in weather and or customer usage patterns 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between geographic regions  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
supplying electricity and natural gas to our retail customers requires us to match the projected demand of our customers with contractual purchase commitments from our suppliers at fixed or indexed prices 
we primarily use forward physical energy purchases and derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
derivative instruments are used to limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity and natural gas purchases  effectively fixing the future purchase price of electricity or natural gas for the applicable forecasted usage and protecting the company from significant price volatility 
derivative instruments measured at fair market value are recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability 
changes in fair market value are recognized currently in earnings unless the instrument has met specific hedge accounting criteria 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded on a net basis in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified as direct energy cost in the statement of operations as the energy is delivered 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors and credit exposure 
we do not engage in trading activities in the wholesale energy market other than to manage our direct energy cost in an attempt to improve the profit margin associated with the requirements of our retail customers 
with most electricity and natural gas customers  we have the ability to change prices with short notice  and  therefore  the impact on gross profits from increases in energy prices is not material for these customers 
however  sharp and sustained price increases could result in customer attrition without corresponding price increases by local utilities and other competitors 
approximately of our electricity customers and of our natural gas customers are subject to multi month fixed priced unhedged contracts and  accordingly a per megawatt hour increase in the cost of purchased power and a per mmbtu increase in the cost of purchased natural gas could result in an estimated  decrease in gross profit for power  and an estimated  decrease in gross profit for natural gas  respectively  for fiscal credit risk our primary credit risks are exposure to our retail customers for default on their contractual obligations 
given the high credit quality of the majority of our energy suppliers  credit risk resulting from failure of our suppliers to deliver or perform on their contracted energy commitments is not considered significant 
the retail credit default or nonpayment risk is managed through established credit policies which actively require screening of customer credit prior to contracting with a customer  potentially requiring deposits from customers and actively discontinuing business with customers that do not pay as contractually obligated 
retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
counterparty credit risks result primarily from credit extended to us for our purchases of energy from our suppliers 
favorable credit terms from our suppliers make it easier to procure wholesale energy to service our customers  however  adverse market conditions or poor financial performance by us may result in a reduction or 
table of contents elimination of available unsecured counterparty credit lines 
additionally  we have significant amounts of energy commitments to our contracted term customers that we have hedged forward  often for several months 
a significant decrease in energy prices could adversely impact our cash collateral requirements 
interest rate risk since we had no short or long term debt outstanding at july   our only exposure to interest rate risks is limited to our investment of excess cash balances in interest bearing instruments 
we generally invest cash equivalents in short term credit instruments consisting primarily of high credit quality  short term money market funds and insured  re marketable government agency securities with interest rate reset maturities of days or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our investments and we believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
as our practice has been  and currently continues to be  to only invest in high quality debt instruments with maturities or remarketing dates of days or less  we currently are not materially susceptible to interest rate risks
