these include the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment both the gerber scientific products and spandex business units  the apparel and flexible materials operating segment gerber technology and the ophthalmic lens processing segment gerber coburn 
new products fuel the company s overall revenue growth and future sustainability 
during fiscal  the company launched several new products across each operating segment 
these products have been well received in their intended markets  as indicated by revenue growth 
the company has expanded geographically within the past years 
most notably  the company s china operations have continued to develop and include outsourced manufacturing operations 
the company currently has approximately employees in china 
this geographic expansion is consistent with the company s customers shift to lower cost locations  primarily within the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
these activities have contributed broadly to the company s revenue performance 
the growth is primarily from new product development  the success of the company s initiatives within china and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million as compared with fiscal key new product revenue of million increased percent as compared with fiscal  driven by the solara uv inkjet printer and related aftermarket materials in the sign making and specialty graphics segment and the xls and xlc spreading and cutting equipment in the apparel and flexible materials segment 
the table below shows revenue from each segment over the past three fiscal years 
in fiscal  foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue as compared with fiscal for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands sign making and specialty graphics apparel and flexible materials ophthalmic lens processing manufacturing  selling  general and administrative costs have increased in relation to this revenue growth  though the company was successful at improving operating margins 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative costs reflected modest improvement as compared with the same prior year periods 
the improvement as a percentage of revenue was achieved despite the impact of expensing stock option compensation costs beginning in fiscal in conjunction with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r

these initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on operating income in fiscal with an emphasis on maintaining the company s presence as a premier customer service provider  the company plans to implement a customer relationship management software tool during fiscal the investment in this software is expected to provide significant benefits by better enabling the company to capture  store and analyze customer information 
in prior years  the company focused efforts on improving its overall debt structure and position 
the company ended its fiscal year with debt of million as of april  this was the lowest outstanding debt as of a year end since fiscal the interest structure of the current credit facility  entered into less than two years ago  and the ongoing repayment of debt have resulted in lower interest expense in fiscal for half of fiscal and all of fiscal  interest expense was incurred under the company s previous credit facilities with higher interest rates 
increased debt related to acquisition activities coupled with rising interest rates could increase interest expense in fiscal the company s effective tax rate decreased for the year ended april  as compared with the year ended april   returning to a more normalized level of percent as compared with the fiscal effective tax rate of percent 
the fiscal higher effective tax rate was primarily related to prior year charges from a change in united kingdom tax law and the establishment of certain foreign country valuation allowances 
in fiscal  the company expects to continue to grow its revenue base through new products  market expansion and targeted acquisitions 
during november  the company completed an acquisition of the apparel and flexible material segment s spanish distributor 
the company s sign making and specialty graphic s segment completed an acquisition during may of data technology  inc  a manufacturer of automated cutting hardware for the design  die making and short run production segments of the packaging and graphics industries

within the apparel and flexible materials segment  incremental sales of new products and continued growth in asian markets contributed to the sales increase 
equipment revenue from new products also fueled the increase in the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
foreign currency translation additionally contributed to the increased revenue in each segment in fiscal in fiscal  the company reported higher revenue in the apparel and flexible materials and the sign making and specialty graphics segments  despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
the growth in the apparel and flexible materials segment reflected anticipated growth in asian markets 
the growth in the sign making and specialty graphic s segment revenue was directly attributable to two internally developed printers  the solara uv and edge fx  as well as increased sales volume of related aftermarket supply materials 
partially offsetting this growth  the company reported slightly lower revenue in the ophthalmic lens processing segment attributable mainly to lower aftermarket sales 
the following table shows that the mix of equipment and software  aftermarket supplies and service revenue as a percentage of total revenue during the past three fiscal years has not significantly changed 
the slight shift in mix from fiscal was attributable to new product introductions in all three operating segments  offset by lower aftermarket revenue primarily within the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
for the fiscal years ended april  equipment and software revenue aftermarket supplies revenue service revenue revenue by geographic region and as a percentage of consolidated revenue in fiscal  and was as follows for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands north america europe rest of world in fiscal  the increase in europe primarily reflects the success of the company s sign making and specialty graphics segment for both equipment and aftermarket volume as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
the more significant increase in the rest of world region is as a result of the apparel and flexible materials business volume in asian markets and is attributable to both the continued migration of apparel production to growth markets  particularly china  and the success of new products 
this shift is also the primary factor causing the decline in the north american region 
in fiscal  the increase in north american revenue was primarily related to the success of new products 
this increase was slightly offset by a decline for north american aftermarket revenue for the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
the increase in the rest of world revenue reflected the migration of apparel production to growth markets 
the decrease in european revenue was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation 
the company operates throughout the world and therefore operating results are affected by global  industrial and political factors 
however  geographic and industry diversity has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the company s consolidated revenue and operating results 
fiscal operating charges the fiscal operating loss included pre tax operating charges of million 
there were no similar charges in fiscal or fiscal of that amount  million related to costs incurred in improving the operations of the spandex business and to management s decision to withdraw from a product in the sign making and specialty graphics segment

offsetting these favorable items  freight and logistics costs increased in both fiscal and as a result of increased sales volume and escalating costs of fuel 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change selling  general and administrative expenses although selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses in fiscal were lower year over year than in fiscal the fiscal increase in sg a costs as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing costs of million  which were related both to increased selling costs and the marketing efforts associated with new product launches

the company recognized a million previously unrealized gain associated with sale activity within its rabbi trust mutual fund portfolio during the fourth quarter of fiscal this realized gain is not expected to recur in fiscal the foreign exchange gains are substantially related to the weakening of the united states dollar and its corresponding impact on translating intercompany short term trade balances 
routine bank service fees of million in fiscal partially offset these gains 
other expense decreased in fiscal by million as compared with fiscal this was primarily related to lower foreign currency transaction losses of million as compared with fiscal this decrease was primarily a result from the designation as long term of certain intercompany loans in which settlement is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future 
additionally  certain fiscal legal costs of approximately million did not recur in fiscal offsetting these items  fiscal results included higher bank fees related to refinancing the company s credit facilities of approximately million and fiscal results included fixed asset gains from the sale of certain muskogee  oklahoma facility assets of approximately million 
interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands interest expense weighted average credit facility interest rates interest expense primarily consists of interest costs incurred under the company s borrowings and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense has steadily decreased over the past three fiscal years 
this is attributable to lower average interest rates and debt 
the decline in interest rates began with the company s refinancing of its primary credit facility on october  this event lowered overall interest rates charged and reduced amortization expense related to lower debt issue costs 
though debt balances fluctuate daily  the company s average debt has decreased in the last three fiscal years 
in connection with the refinancing on october   the company expensed the remaining capitalized deferred debt issuance costs of million related to its previous credit facility and incurred million of other related charges 
income tax expense for the fiscal years ended april  effective tax rate in fiscal  the company recorded a million noncash charge attributable to the elimination of a deferred tax asset associated with a tax legislation change in the united kingdom 
excluding this tax charge  the company s consolidated tax rate would have been percent compared with the statutory rate of percent

critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
inventories the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory at the apparel and flexible materials segment s foreign non manufacturing companies is valued on a weighted average basis  which approximates first in  first out 
the company reviews the market value of inventory on an ongoing basis 
based on these reviews  inventory write downs are recorded  as necessary  to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
the amount of these write downs equals the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolete inventory is generally identified by comparing expected inventory usage to actual on hand quantities 
inventory write downs are provided for on hand inventory in excess of pre defined usage estimates 
forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical actual inventory usage levels forward to future periods 
application of this methodology can have the effect of increasing inventory write downs during periods of declining demand and  conversely  reducing the required inventory write downs during periods of accelerating demand 
inventories included a million reduction as of april  for the estimated lower of cost or market adjustment against the company s standard costs 
goodwill the company reviews the value of goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter  or sooner if events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
no indicators of goodwill impairment were identified during fiscal the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  which is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assess goodwill for impairment  internal valuation analyses are performed 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis 
this approach uses estimates and assumptions  including projected cash flows  discount rate assumptions and perpetual growth rate assumptions 
a percent decrease in the fair value of the company s reporting units at the fiscal evaluation date would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment in the apparel and flexible materials reporting unit  but would have resulted in a step two test being required in the ophthalmic lens processing and spandex reporting units 
as of april   the company had million of goodwill assets on the consolidated balance sheet  which management believes are realizable based on the estimated cash flows of the associated businesses 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used  such as future sales and expense levels  in assessing that value may need to be re evaluated in the case of market deterioration  which could result in future impairment of those assets 
pension plans in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
the company adopted sfas on april  and was required to initially recognize the funded status of its defined benefit plans and provide certain disclosures 
see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions relating to  among other variables  the expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these assumptions are updated at the measurement date and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized in future periods 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed considering several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium  an inflation estimate weighted towards future expectations  expectations for real returns  and adjustments for anticipated or historical economic changes using a long term investment horizon 
the effects of asset diversification and periodic fund rebalancing are also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent and will be percent for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant and increasing or decreasing the expected long term rate of return of the plan assets by percentage points would increase or decrease  as appropriate  fiscal consolidated earnings before income taxes by approximately million 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the pension plans is based on the expected yields of high quality  long term corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent and will be percent for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate for the plans would increase or decrease  as appropriate  fiscal consolidated earnings before income taxes by approximately million 
the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels is calculated based primarily on expected wage inflation 
for fiscal  the assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels used for determining net periodic pension expense was percent and will be percent for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant and increasing or decreasing the long term rate of increase in compensation levels by percentage points would decrease or increase  as appropriate  fiscal consolidated earnings before income taxes by approximately million 
pension expense for fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
in subsequent fiscal years  future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  available tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  the company has analyzed its historical earnings in each jurisdiction taking into consideration the effect of certain nonrecurring items  which negatively impacted earnings in those periods 
the company has also considered the favorable shift in profits between various jurisdictions resulting from tax planning strategies in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period such determination was made

fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement assuming the tax authority has full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the company will adopt fin as of may  the cumulative effect upon adoption will be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting fin on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities routinely review the company s tax returns 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the impact of these examinations on the company s liability for income taxes cannot be presently determined 
in management s opinion  adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from these examinations based on the company s estimated range of exposure 
the company has not recognized united states tax expense on the unremitted earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries because it is not anticipated that such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
these undistributed earnings were approximately million as of april  new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exposures foreign currency exposures are identified and managed at the corporate level 
to manage these risks  the company uses specific planning strategies with its operations located in various locations  which may include the use of foreign currency forward contracts  international tax transfer pricing strategies and intercompany loan planning strategies 
there were no foreign currency forward contracts in place as of april  or interest rate exposures the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates because it finances its operations through variable interest rate debt 
as of april   obligations under the company s credit facility bore interest at floating rates 
interest on obligations under the revolving credit facility is charged  at the option of the company  at the london interbank offer rate libor plus percent  or at the lender s prime rate 
a percent change in the interest rate applicable to the company s million of variable rate credit facility debt would increase interest expense approximately million 
obligations under the outstanding million of industrial development bonds are at interest rates that are adjusted weekly to market rates 
a percent change in the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance on these bonds would not have a significant impact to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
