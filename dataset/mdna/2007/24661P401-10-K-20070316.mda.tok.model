item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
since our founding in by a team of physicians  we have been a development stage company engaged primarily in developing and testing the delcath system for the treatment of liver cancer 
a substantial portion of our historical expenses have been for the development of our medical device and the clinical trials of our product  and the pursuit of patents worldwide  as described in item under patents  trade secrets and proprietary rights 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses from costs for product development  clinical studies  securing patents  regulatory activities  manufacturing and establishment of a sales and marketing organization without any significant revenues 
a detailed description of the cash used to fund historical operations is in the financial statements and the notes thereto 
without an fda approved product and commercial sales  we will continue to be dependent upon existing cash and the sale of equity or debt to fund future activities 
while the amount of future net losses and time required to reach profitability are uncertain  our ability to generate significant revenue and become profitable will depend on our success in commercializing our device 
during  delcath initiated the clinical trial of the system for isolated liver perfusion using the chemotherapeutic agent  melphalan 
enrollment of new patients in the phase i trial was completed in in  we commenced a phase ii clinical trial protocol for the study of the delcath drug delivery system for inoperable primary liver cancer and adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine cancers that have metastazed to the liver using melphalan 
in  we started enrolling and treating patients in a phase iii protocol for the study of the delcath drug delivery system for inoperable melanoma in the liver using melphalan under the fast track and spa approved protocol 
over the next months  we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to the research and development of our technology  including phase iii and phase ii clinical trials clinical trials using melphalan with the delcath system 
additional funds  when available  will be committed to pre clinical and clinical trials for the use of other chemotherapy agents with the delcath system for the treatment of liver cancer  and the development of additional products and components 
we will also continue efforts to qualify additional sources of the key components of our device  in an effort to further reduce manufacturing costs and minimize dependency on a single source of supply 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our available funds to be sufficient for our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through provided no studies using new agents or treating new organs are initiated outside of the crada with the nci 
the company is not projecting any capital expenditures that will significantly affect the company s liquidity during the next months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and product development programs  including clinical studies  the timing and costs of making various united states and foreign regulatory filings  obtaining approvals and complying with regulations  the timing and effectiveness of product commercialization activities  including marketing arrangements overseas  the timing and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
future capital needs  additional future funding the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company has operated at a loss for its entire history and there can be no assurance of its ever achieving consistent profitability 
the company believes its capital resources are adequate to fund operations for at least the next twelve months but anticipates that it will require additional working capital after there can be no assurance that such working capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

application of critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the notes to financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of delcath s financial statements 
the company is still in the development stage and has no revenues  trade receivables  inventories  or significant fixed or intangible assets and therefore has very limited opportunities to choose among accounting policies or methods 
in many cases  the company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
additionally  the company devotes substantial resources to clinical trials and other research and development activities relating to obtaining fda and other approvals for the delcath system  the cost of which is required to be charged to expense as incurred 
this further limits the company s choice of accounting policies and methods 
similarly  management believes there are very limited circumstances in which the company s financial statement estimates are significant or critical 
the company considers the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate 
in applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  management estimates future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company adopted sfas r in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of these securities
