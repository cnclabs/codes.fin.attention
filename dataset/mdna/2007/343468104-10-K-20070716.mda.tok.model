item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our results from through our results have benefited from management s focus on the core of our business  uhp water pumps and the applications that integrate these pumps to cut and clean material 
improved global awareness of the benefits of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology over other traditional methods has resulted in increased global adoption of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology across multiple industries 
our investment in sales and marketing has been a key factor in the improved global awareness 
additionally  our investment in research and engineering has allowed us to continue to introduce new waterjet applications and product enhancements  expanding the market for waterjet technology 
sales were million in  million in  and million in our combined sales for north america  asia and other international waterjet  which were of sales in  in and in  benefited from the increased global adoption of waterjet technology 
overall sales growth was negatively impacted by a decline in sales at our asia waterjet and application segments 
asia sales  which were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in  were negatively impacted in by the management disruption resulting from the asia investigations  which discovered the fraudulent deferral of revenue recognition by certain former asia waterjet managers and the absence of the large nanojet launch order that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a slow down in sales to the semiconductor industry 
we have changed the management team in asia waterjet and expect the segment to return to growth in applications segment sales  were of sales in  in  and in beginning in  we started repositioning this business to focus on integrating waterjet cutting cells into engineered robotic systems and reduce the focus on non waterjet applications and the automotive industry 
we believe the applications segment is now better positioned for growth in the future

receivables days sales outstanding at april  decreased to versus at april   due to changes in product mix in fiscal unbilled revenues decreased from million at april  to million at april  the decrease was due to a lower number of aerospace and automation contracts currently in process 
our unbilled receivables relate to equipment and systems sales accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
unbilled revenues fluctuate due to the scheduling of production and achievement of certain billing milestones 
in general  receivables can be negatively affected by the traditionally longer payment cycle outside the united states and the timing of billings and payments on large special system orders 
we do not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on our short term liquidity requirements 
because of the lead time to build and deliver such equipment  ultimate collection of such accounts can be subject to changing customer business and economic conditions 
at april   the net receivables balance decreased million or from april  the decrease in net receivables stemmed from the reduction in trade receivables of million or from million at april  to million at april  due to the sale of the avure business and collection of customer accounts 
receivables days sales outstanding including unbilled revenues and excluding the avure business for the comparative periods at april  decreased to versus at april   due to changes in product mix in fiscal the overall decrease in trade receivables was offset by a slight increase in unbilled revenues from million at april  to million at april  the decrease due to the disposition of the avure business was offset by an increase in the percentage completion on our aerospace contracts as well as a higher number of automation contracts being worked on

inventories at april  decreased million or from april  driven by the sale of the avure business 
this was offset by an increase of million in waterjet inventory in asia  europe and the us primarily related to equipment for our aerospace contracts 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had total cash of million  of which approximately million was held by divisions outside the united states 
the repatriation of offshore cash balances from certain divisions will trigger tax liabilities 
in fiscal  we repatriated million  net of tax of million from two foreign subsidiaries and we plan to continue repatriating additional funds in future from these foreign subsidiaries

our domestic senior credit agreement credit agreement is our primary source of external funding 
effective july   we executed a million  three year senior credit agreement with bank of america na and na bank na this credit agreement expires july  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate at april  or is linked to libor plus a percentage depending on our leverage ratios  at our option 
the agreement sets forth specific financial covenants to be attained on a quarterly basis  which we believe  based on our financial forecasts  are achievable 
at april   we had million of domestic unused line of credit available  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
we are in the process of negotiating an amendment to increase our credit line to million and expect to finalize this amendment in july this is expected to provide us with liquidity that could be used to make acquisitions  repurchase shares  or pay dividends 
our capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million in fiscal  primarily related to information technology spending and facility improvement 
it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally 
our capital spending for fiscal and amounted to million and million  respectively 
we believe that our existing cash  cash from operations  and credit facilities at april  are adequate to fund our operations through april  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and other commercial commitments over various future periods as of april  see notes  and to april  consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding foreign currency contracts  long term debt  and lease obligations  respectively 
in thousands maturity by fiscal year thereafter total inventory purchases operating leases other long term debt  notes payable capital leases total 
table of contents the amount presented above as inventory purchases include all open purchase orders 
we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and our cash flows from operations in future periods 
these obligations include non inventory vendor commitments  such as professional retainers and trade show commitments 
this table is based on the contractual due dates of the long term debt  notes payable balances and capital leases 
total future payments of interest are and have been excluded from this table due to the insignificant amounts 
long term debt  notes payable and lease commitments are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at april   there were no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these estimates and our accounting policies  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for sales of uhp waterjet pumps  consumables  services  and billing for freight charges  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  because the flowmaster software is essential to the functionality of the company s waterjet systems  the company recognizes revenue on sales of waterjet systems in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
specifically  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  or probable in the case of sale of waterjet systems 
generally  sales revenue is recognized at the time of shipment  receipt by customer  or  if applicable  upon completion of customer acceptance provisions 
unearned revenue is recorded for products or services that have not been provided but have been invoiced under contractual agreements or paid for by a customer  or when products or services have been provided but all the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  the arrangement is divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is vendor specific objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
for 
table of contents contract arrangements that combine deliverables such as systems with embedded software  and installation  each deliverable is generally considered a separate unit of accounting or element 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
the amount allocable to a delivered item is limited to the amount that the company is entitled to bill and collect and is not contingent upon the delivery performance of additional items 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
for complex aerospace and automation systems designed and manufactured to buyers specification  the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
typical lead times can range from two to months 
sales and profits on such contracts are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract the cost to cost method 
losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
the impact of revisions of contract estimates is recognized as a cumulative change in estimate in the period in which the revisions are made 
valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently record a valuation for obsolete or excess inventory for parts and equipment that are no longer used due to design changes to our products or lack of customer demand 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels and  if we identify an excess condition based on our usage and our financial policies  we record a corresponding valuation allowance which establishes a new cost basis for our inventory 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
our valuation allowance requires the use of management judgment regarding technological obsolescence and forecasted customer demand 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our valuation allowance 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
valuation of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we review our deferred tax assets regularly to determine their realizability 
when evidence exists that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize a deferred tax asset dta  we set up a valuation allowance against the asset based on our estimate of the amount which will likely not be realizable 
future utilization of deferred tax assets could result in recording of income tax benefits 
the timing of any potential reversal of the valuation allowance is contingent on prior profitability and future expected profitability 
a large component of the dta relates to our net operating loss nol which will offset future taxable income 
as we become more profitable  the likelihood that the nol will be utilized also increases  which will increase the likelihood we will reverse the valuation allowance against the nol and other deferred tax assets 
the timing of these events is directly related to the timing and degree of our future profitability 
we evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these exposures could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impairment of property and equipment  patents  other intangibles and goodwill we evaluate property and equipment  patents and other intangibles for potential impairment indicators when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors and future plans 
if we conclude that a triggering event has occurred  we will compare the carrying values of the asset with the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from usage of the asset 
if there is a shortfall and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value  we will record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value over fair value 
we estimate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for potential impairment indicators as of our fiscal year end and when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors  and future plans 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill should be evaluated for impairment prior to our fiscal year end 
our impairment evaluation is based on comparing the fair value of the operating units  and if necessary  the implied fair value of goodwill  with corresponding carrying values 
any shortfalls would require us to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and implied value of goodwill 
we determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
expected future operational performance is based on estimates and management s judgment 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
stock based compensation the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r as of the beginning of fiscal year using the modified prospective transition method 
fas r is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
upon adoption  statement r requires the fair value of employee awards issued  modified  repurchased or cancelled to be measured as of the grant or modification dates 
the resulting cost is then recognized in the statement of earnings over the required service period 
in accordance with fas r  the company accruals for compensation costs related to awards with performance conditions based on the probable outcome of that performance condition  compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
expected future performance is based on estimates and management assumptions 
changes in actual performance can materially affect the estimated compensation cost recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
see note stock based compensation plans for additional information including the effects of adopting fas r 
legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience 
we record reserves related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote and  therefore  no liability is recorded 
management discloses the facts regarding material matters assessed as reasonably possible and potential exposure  if determinable 
costs incurred with defending claims are expensed as incurred 
as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable liabilities for the settlement of these claims
