introduction our company we are a leading provider of health information services to consumers  physicians and other healthcare professionals  employers and health plans 
we have organized our business into two operating segments as follows online services 
we own and operate both public and private online portals 
our public portals enable consumers to become more informed about healthcare choices and assist them in playing an active role in managing their health 
the public portals also enable physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve their clinical knowledge and practice of medicine  as well as their communication with patients 
our public portals generate revenue primarily through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products  including continuing medical education cme services 
our sponsors and advertisers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and consumer products companies 
we provide 
table of contents information and services that enable employees and members  respectively  to make more informed benefit  treatment and provider decisions through our private portals for employers and health plans 
we generate revenue from our private portals through the licensing of these portals to employers and health plans either directly or through distributors 
we also distribute our online content and services to other entities and generate revenue from these arrangements through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products and content syndication fees 
we also provide related services for use by such employees and members  including lifestyle education and personalized telephonic health coaching as a result of the acquisition of summex on june  the company also provides promotion and physician recruitment services for use by pharmaceutical  medical device and healthcare companies as a result of the acquisition of medsite on september  publishing and other services 
we provide several offline products and services acp medicine and acs surgery principles of practice  our medical reference textbooks  the little blue book  a physician directory  and webmd the magazine  a consumer targeted publication launched in early that we distribute free of charge to physician office waiting rooms 
we generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our medical reference textbooks  sales of the little blue book directories and advertisements in those directories  and sales of advertisements in webmd the magazine 
we also conduct in person medical education as a result of the acquisition of the assets of conceptis technologies  inc in december our publishing and other services segment complements our online services segment and extends the reach of our brand and our influence with health involved consumers and clinically active physicians 
background information on certain trends and strategies several key trends in the healthcare and internet industries are influencing the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends  and the strategies we have developed in response  are described briefly below use of the internet by consumer and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information 
as consumers are required to assume greater financial responsibility for rising healthcare costs  the internet serves as a valuable resource by providing them with immediate access to searchable and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  assess risks  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
the internet has also become a primary source of information for physicians seeking to improve clinical practice and is growing relative to traditional information sources  such as conferences  meetings and offline journals 
increased online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion of this amount is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of our advertisers and sponsors  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will result in increasing demand for our services 
changes in health plan design 
while overall healthcare costs have been rising at a rapid annual rate  employers costs of providing healthcare benefits to their employees are increasing at an even faster rate 
in response to these increases  employers are seeking to shift a greater portion of healthcare costs onto their employees and to redefine traditional health benefits 
employers and health plans want to motivate their members and employees to evaluate their healthcare decisions more carefully in order to be more cost effective 
as employers continue to implement high deductible and consumer directed healthcare plans referred to as cdhps and related health savings accounts referred to as hsas to achieve these goals  we believe that we will be able to attract more employers and health plans to use 
table of contents our private online portals 
in additional  health plans and employers have begun to recognize that encouraging the good health of their members and employees not only benefits the members and employees but also has financial benefits for the health plans and employers 
accordingly  many employers and health plans have been enhancing health management programs and taking steps to provide healthcare information and education to employees and members  including through online services 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these trends because our private portals provide the tools and information employees and plan members need in order to make more informed decisions about healthcare provider  benefit and treatment options 
traffic to the webmd health network 
during the past several years  an increasing portion of the page view traffic to the webmd health network has come from web sites that we own 
however  a portion of the total page view traffic continues to come from web sites owned by third parties that carry our content including the aol division of time warner 
during the year ended december   third party web sites accounted for approximately of the webmd health network s aggregate page views 
in the past  an even larger percentage of the total page view traffic had come from third party web sites 
under an agreement between webmd and the aol division of time warner aol  which was entered into in may and expires on may   webmd provides healthcare content  tools and services for use on certain aol properties 
webmd does not expect its existing agreement with aol to continue following the expiration of that agreement 
the monthly unique users and page view traffic from aol was and  respectively  of the aggregate webmd health network monthly unique users and page view traffic for the year ended december  as a result of the expiration of that agreement in may  the monthly unique users and page view traffic from aol will no longer be part of the webmd health network 
additionally  revenues and earnings of approximately million per year related to certain contractual guarantees will also end with the expiration of that agreement 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our businesses from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 
basis of presentation our company is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering ipo of class a common stock on september  our class a common stock has traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol wbmd since september  and now trades on the nasdaq global select market

we accrued  as of december  for the cash payment made in february related to rxlist s achievement of page views exceeding certain thresholds during the three months ended december  the results of operations of rxlist are included in our online services segment 
seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
advertising and sponsorship revenue within our online services segment is seasonal  primarily due to the annual budget approval process of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
our private portal licensing revenue is historically higher in the second half of the year as new customers are typically added during this period in conjunction with their annual open enrollment periods for employee benefits 
finally  the annual distribution cycle within our publishing and other services segment results in a significant portion of our revenue in this segment being recognized in the second and third quarter of each calendar year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  much of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could 
table of contents differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of prepaid advertising  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and web site development costs  the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts  certain accrued expenses and contingencies  share based compensation to employees and transactions with emdeon 
we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as related health coaching services are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
subscription revenue is recognized over the subscription period 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
in certain instances where fair value does not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized when the last element is delivered 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in  and stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as fasb issued sfas no 
 revised share based payment which we refer to as sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which we refer to as sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the service period generally the vesting period in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r on january  and elected to use the modified prospective transition method and as a result  prior period results were not restated 
under the modified prospective method  awards that were granted or modified on or after january  are measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested stock options and restricted stock awards that were granted prior to january  will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  using the same grant date fair value and same expense attribution method used under sfas  except that all awards are recognized in the 
table of contents results of operations over the remaining vesting periods 
the impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized for all stock based compensation beginning january  as of december   approximately  and  of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested awards net of estimated forfeitures is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  related to the emdeon and our stock based compensation plans 
the total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation expense for both the emdeon and our stock based compensation plans is approximately four years  however  the majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two years  in accordance with our vesting provisions 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in this model are expected dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
the expected volatility for stock options to purchase emdeon common stock is based on implied volatility from traded options of emdeon common stock combined with historical volatility of emdeon s common stock 
the expected volatility for stock options to purchase our class a common stock is based on implied volatility from traded options of stock of comparable companies combined with historical stock price volatility of comparable companies 
deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  and  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  on a separate return basis 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of  on a legal entity basis 
this amount reflects the utilization of approximately  by the emdeon consolidated group as a result of the sale of certain emdeon businesses 
subject to certain limitations  these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
due to a lack of a history of generating taxable income  we record a valuation allowance equal to of our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase income in the period that such determination is made  and may decrease income in subsequent periods 
transactions with emdeon 
as discussed further below  our expenses reflect a services fee for an allocation of costs for corporate services provided by emdeon 
our expenses also reflect the allocation of a portion of the cost of emdeon s healthcare plans and the allocation of stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and other stock based compensation 
our sales and marketing expense reflects an allocation to emdeon for the utilization by it of advertising services available to us from news corporation 
we are included in the consolidated federal tax return filed by emdeon 
in february  we received a reimbursement of million pursuant to our tax sharing agreement related to our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards utilized by emdeon in connection with gains related to the sale of certain emdeon businesses 
additionally  our revenue includes revenue from emdeon for services we provide 
transactions with emdeon in connection with the ipo in september  we entered into a number of agreements with emdeon governing the future relationship of the companies  including a services agreement  a tax sharing agreement and an indemnity agreement 
these agreements cover a variety of matters  including responsibility for certain liabilities  including tax liabilities  as well as matters related to emdeon providing us with administrative services  such as payroll  accounting  tax  employee benefit plan  employee insurance  intellectual property  legal and information processing services 
under the services agreement  we have agreed to reimburse emdeon an amount that reasonably approximates emdeon s cost of providing services to us 
emdeon has agreed to make the services available to us for up to five years  however  we are not required  under the services agreement  to continue to obtain services from emdeon and are able to terminate services  in whole or in part  at any time generally by providing  with respect to the specified services or groups of services  
table of contents days prior notice and  in some cases  paying a nominal termination fee to cover costs relating to the termination 
the terms of the services agreement provide that emdeon has the option to terminate the services that it provides for us  in whole or in part  if it ceases to provide such services for itself  upon at least days written notice to us 
on january   we entered into additional agreements with emdeon in which both parties agreed to support each other s product development and marketing efforts of specific product lines for agreed upon fees as defined in the agreements 
the new agreements cover a term of five years 
on february   the tax sharing agreement was amended to provide that emdeon will compensate us for any use of our net operating losses that may result from certain extraordinary transactions  as defined in the tax sharing agreement  including a sale by emdeon of its business services and practice services operating segments 
on september   emdeon completed the sale of emdeon practice services eps segment for approximately  in cash 
on november   emdeon completed the sale of a interest in its emdeon business services ebs segment for approximately  in cash 
emdeon recognized a taxable gain on the sale of its emdeon practice services and business services segments and expects to utilize a portion of its federal net operating loss nol carryforwards to offset the gain on these transactions 
under the tax sharing agreement between emdeon and us  we were reimbursed for any of our nol carryforwards utilized by emdeon in these transactions at the current federal statutory rate of 
during february  emdeon reimbursed us  as an estimate of the payment required pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with respect to the eps sale and the ebs sale which amount is subject to adjustment in connection with the filing of the applicable tax returns 
this reimbursement was recorded as a capital contribution which increased additional paid in capital at december  the consolidated financial statements include allocations for the following charges from the company to emdeon revenue 
our revenue includes revenue from emdeon for services we provide to other emdeon businesses for licensing of our private portal services  revenue for licensing of our database of physicians  and advertising by emdeon in the little blue book  our physician directory 
we record these revenues at rates comparable to those charged to third parties for comparable services 
advertising expense 
emdeon utilized the advertising services available to us from news corporation  which are included in prepaid advertising within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we allocated costs to emdeon based on its utilization of this asset 
this charge included a proportional allocation based on the number of emdeon operating segments identified in each advertisement and an allocation of cost to emdeon for the promotion of the webmd brand 
our portion of the advertising services utilized is reflected in sales and marketing expense and is reported net of the amount charged to emdeon 
on august   emdeon and other businesses of emdeon began to use emdeon as their primary brand  instead of webmd 
accordingly  we no longer allocate any advertising expense to emdeon  or other businesses of emdeon  related to any advertising that promotes the webmd brand 
if emdeon uses our prepaid advertising for promotion of the emdeon brand or other brands used by its other businesses  we will allocate the related cost to emdeon  however  the amount of such future usage  if any  is currently unknown 
charges from emdeon to our company corporate services 
we are charged a services fee for costs related to corporate services provided to us by emdeon 
these amounts are reflected in general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations  net of any costs we may incur on behalf of emdeon
