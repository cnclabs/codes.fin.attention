item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we develop and license rules based business process management bpm software and provide professional services  maintenance and training relating to our software 
we focus our sales efforts on target accounts  which are companies or divisions within companies  and are typically large organizations that are among the leaders in their industry 
we frequently sell limited size initial licenses to these target accounts rather than selling large application licenses 
this allows our customers to quickly realize business value from our software and limits their up front investment 
once a customer has realized this initial value  we work with the customer to identify opportunities for follow on sales 
follow on sales are often larger than the initial sale  and the sales process for follow on sales is often shorter as a result of the established relationship with the customer 
our customers typically request professional services and training to assist them in implementing our products 
almost all of our customers also purchase maintenance on our products  which includes rights to upgrades and new releases  incident resolution and technical assistance 
we provide maintenance and training services directly to most of our customers 
professional services are provided directly by us in some situations and through our network of partners in other cases 
the amount of professional services provided by our partners has been increasing in recent years 
by utilizing these partners  we have significantly increased the supply of skilled service consultants that can assist our customers 
in certain situations  our partners are also able to offer lower rates to our customers due to the use of resources located in other countries  thereby reducing the overall cost 
some of our partners have more headcount dedicated to consulting services for our products than we have 
we believe this trend is good for our business because of the breadth of domain expertise that our partners can bring to solutions 
we expect that our services revenue may grow more slowly over time than if we did not rely on our partners 
beginning in  most of our license revenue from new license signings has involved our pegarules process commander software and related solution frameworks 
these products often require less implementation assistance than prior generations of our software products 
in many cases this has required us to shorten the length of the sales process and the time required to receive customer acceptance of the software product 
significantly  pegarules process commander and solution frameworks can be used more broadly by customers within our traditional financial services and healthcare markets  as well as by customers outside of our traditional markets  enabling us to sell to expanded markets 
in recent years  we have typically licensed our software to new customers pursuant to perpetual licenses  under which a customer pays a single license fee at the commencement of the license  rather than term licenses 
under term licenses a customer pays a monthly fee during the license term and must renew the license for additional fees to continue to use the software after the original term 
we expect that perpetual licenses for new customers will continue to be a significant portion of total license signings  although we expect to enter into new term licenses in certain instances 
our use of perpetual licenses rather than term licenses may have the effect  with respect to a given transaction  of increasing our license revenue and cash flow in the short term  but of decreasing the amount of renewal revenue and cash flow in the future 
recently  we have been entering into more term licenses with contract provisions that require the term license revenue to be recognized over the license term as payments become due  or ratably over the license term when payments are made in advance 
this has the effect  with respect to a particular agreement  of reducing our term license revenue in the initial period but increasing the amount of recurring future term license revenue during the remainder of the license term  but does not change the expected cash flow 
generally  in prior periods  we entered into term licenses with contract provisions that required us to recognize the present value of committed future term license payments upon customer acceptance at the beginning of the license term 
overview of results of operations the dollar value of license signings in was significantly higher than the dollar value of license signings in the increase in the dollar value of license signings for was due to the increased success of our strategy of focusing on initial and follow on sales to target accounts 
we are investing in sales and marketing to drive continued growth in our license signings  however actual license signings are likely to fluctuate considerably quarter to quarter 
total revenue in increased to million from million in license revenue decreased million and services revenue increased million 
professional services and training revenue increased million to million in from million in  while maintenance revenue increased million to million in from million in the million increase in professional services and training revenue reflects increased demand from our customers for these services 
the million increase in maintenance revenue is associated with an expanded installed based of software and a higher proportion of perpetual licenses in the installed base which yield greater maintenance revenue than term licenses 
gross margin increased by million from million in to million in primarily due to an increase of million in services gross margin  partially offset by a decrease in license gross margin 
historically  our mix of license and services revenue has fluctuated from period to period  and we believe it will continue to do so 

table of contents income before provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in license gross margin  a million increase in operating expenses  partially offset by a million increase in services gross margin  a million increase in other income and expense related to foreign currency transactions and a million improvement in interest income 
net income for decreased to million from million in  due to the decrease in income before provision for income taxes partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in we generated million in cash flow from operations during  and ended the period with million in cash and short term investments and million in combined short and long term license installment receivables 
consistent with our strategy of developing multiple relationships within target customer organizations to identify opportunities for follow on sales  a majority of our revenue in and was from existing customers who chose to add on to  renew or extend their use of our software 
however  new customers meaning companies or organizational divisions which were not current licensees of our software accounted for million  or  of total revenue and million  or  of total revenue

our international revenue may fluctuate in the future because such revenue is generally dependent upon a small number of product acceptances by our customers during a given period 
historically  most of our contracts have been denominated in us dollars 
we expect  however  that in the future more of our contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies which may expose us to increased currency exchange risk 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our total revenue for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in services revenue 
the following table summarizes our revenue composition in millions year ended december  license revenue perpetual licenses term licenses total license revenue services revenue professional services and training maintenance total services revenue total revenue total license revenue for decreased to million from million in the decrease in total license revenue was the result of a million decrease in term license revenue partially offset by a million increase in perpetual license revenue 
the decrease in term license revenue was primarily due to our decision to increasingly enter into term licenses with contract provisions that require the term license to be recognized over the license term as payments become due 
a summary of expected payments for these term licenses is provided on page these payments  which will be recognized as revenue in future periods  as they become due  have increased in total from million at december  to million at december  professional services and training revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in demand from our customers for professional services 
other components of the increase in professional services and training revenue include million in revenue from three large fixed fee contracts which were completed in  a million increase in billed expenses and million increase in training revenue 
typically  we derive substantial revenue from services provided in connection with the implementation of software licensed by new customers 
maintenance revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in maintenance revenue for was due to a larger installed base of software and a higher proportion of perpetual licenses in the installed base which yield greater maintenance revenue than term licenses 
deferred revenue at december  consisted primarily of amounts by which billed fees exceed revenue recognized on arrangements  and unearned portions of annual maintenance fees paid in advance 
deferred revenue decreased to million as of december   from million as of december  the million decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in the deferred revenue associated with agreements containing customer acceptances or completion of fixed price services engagements  partially offset by a million increase in the unearned portions of annual maintenance fees paid in advance 
international revenue increased to of total revenue for from for this increase was primarily related to one large international license transaction in the third quarter of our international revenue may fluctuate in the future because such revenue is generally dependent upon a small number of license transactions during a given period 
we expect that due to competition from vendors who will do business in foreign currencies  more of our customer transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which may expose us to increased currency exchange risk 

table of contents cost of revenue the cost of maintenance  professional services and training increased to million from million in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased to for from for such increases were due primarily to increases in compensation costs  contracted services and travel costs 
these increases reflect an investment in expanding the pool of trained service personnel  including new professional services employees and partners  to support an increase in the number of license implementation projects and in anticipation of increased demand resulting from new license signings

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was a benefit of million in compared to million provision in the effective tax rate was in compared to in 
table of contents our effective income tax rate for was below the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because we recorded million of benefits related to current period extra territorial income exclusions  million of estimated federal income tax credits  a million benefit from foreign activities  and million of net benefit from state income taxes primarily due to state income tax credits 
these factors were partially offset by million of permanent differences primarily related to nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses and million increase in reserve for tax uncertainties related to international activity 
we have provided reserves for certain tax matters  both domestic and foreign  which it believes could result in additional tax being due 
any additional assessment or reduction of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in the company s effective tax rate in the period that additional facts become known 
the reserve for tax uncertainties totaled approximately million as of december    and judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties  transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries  and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact  unfavorable or favorable  on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our total revenue for decreased to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in services revenue

total license revenue for decreased to million from million in the decrease in total license revenue was the result of a million decrease in perpetual license revenue partially offset by a million increase in term license revenue 
the increase in term license revenue primarily reflected one large new term license transaction with an existing customer in the third quarter of the decrease in perpetual license revenue reflected our strategy of selling smaller initial perpetual licenses to our target accounts  with the potential of larger follow on sales 
term license renewals scheduled for are modestly higher than actual term license renewals in while historically a majority of customers have renewed their term licenses  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
maintenance revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in maintenance revenue for was due to a larger installed base of software and a higher proportion of perpetual licenses in the installed base which yield greater maintenance revenue than term licenses

in the fourth quarter of  we completed a study of our extra territorial income exclusions  which resulted in a decrease of our reserve for tax uncertainties related to this item 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million due primarily to changes in estimates upon completion of the study of benefits related to extra territorial income exclusions  recording of tax refunds and overpayments  and changes in deferred tax items 
these fourth quarter adjustments also significantly decreased the effective tax rate for compared to the statutory rate

the reserve for tax uncertainties totaled approximately million as of december  and liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily from cash flow from operations 
at december   we had cash and equivalents and short term investments of million  a million increase from million at december  this increase was primarily due to million of cash flow from operations and million from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by million used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock and million used for investments in equipment and software improvements 
working capital was million at december   a million increase from million at december  working capital increased primarily due to a million increase in cash and investments and a million increase in trade accounts receivable  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in commissions  vacation and other expenses 
the increase in trade accounts receivable is a result of growth in our business 
despite the increase in trade accounts receivables our days billing outstanding has decreased from days at december  to days at december  cash flow from operating activities for decreased to million from million for during  cash flow benefited from a million reduction in license installments 
the decrease in license installments reflects the lower average remaining life of our term licenses recorded on the balance sheet see discussion below in this section

the board of directors may terminate or modify this dividend program at any time without notice 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next twelve months 
material risks to cash flow from operations include delayed or reduced cash payments accompanying sales of new licenses or a decline in our services business 
there can be no assurance that changes in our plans or other events affecting our operations will not result in materially accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional capital  if needed  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as we require 
as of december   we had material commitments for purchases of customer support and consulting services  and payments under capital and operating leases 
our principal administrative  sales  marketing  support  and research and development operations are located in a  square foot leased facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
the lease for this facility expires in  subject to our option to extend for two additional five year periods 
we also lease space for our other offices in the united states  canada  australia  france  hong kong and the united kingdom 
these leases expire at various dates through rent expense under operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis  to account for scheduled rent increases 
the excess of expense over current payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in other long term liabilities 

table of contents in july  we entered into an agreement to lease additional space in our cambridge massachusetts facility 
the agreement requires the landlord to reimburse us for up to approximately  in costs we incur with respect to improvements to the leased premises 
as of december   we had incurred approximately  in improvement costs  which were recorded to leasehold improvements with a corresponding credit to deferred rent expense to be amortized to rent expense over the lease term  and had not yet been reimbursed 
the lease for this additional space expires in  subject to our option to extend for two additional five year periods 
as of december   our known contractual obligations were as follows contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total and after purchase commitments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total includes deferred rent of million included in other long term liabilities 
net long term deferred income tax liabilities as of december  were million 
this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
the following amounts of cash are due for receipt in connection with our existing term license agreements year ended december  in thousands installment payments for term licenses recorded on the balance sheet installment payments for ratable term licenses not on the balance sheet and thereafter total in a decreasing number of term license agreements  we recognize the present value of future term license payments upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
short term license installments and long term license installments on the balance sheet represent unbilled term license installments that have been recognized as revenue  net of unearned interest income 
payments due for these installments  which include unearned interest income  decreased to million at december  from million at december   as license installment payments billed during exceeded the value of new term licenses where we recognized the present value of future license payments as revenue 
increasingly  we enter into term licenses with contract provisions that require the term license to be recognized as revenue over the license term as payments become due 
installment payments for these ratable term licenses  which are not recorded on the balance sheet  increased to million at december  from million at december  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from two primary sources software license fees and service fees 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  generally contain multiple elements 
in addition to the license  these elements generally include professional consulting services  training and software maintenance services 
software license revenues we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
perpetual software license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract is obtained  no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that typically have a three to five year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the customer s option 
we have a history of successfully collecting payments under our term license arrangements  which have extended payment terms spread over the term of the license 
therefore  in a decreasing number of term license agreements  we have recognized the present value of future term license payments upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
a portion of the license fees payable under each term license agreement equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the past few years 
as a result  revenue that we recognize relative to new license arrangements of this type would be impacted by changes in market interest rates 
increasingly  our term license agreements have contract provisions that require the license revenue to be recognized over the term of the agreement as payments become due  or ratably over the term of the license when payments are made in advance 
service revenues our services revenue comprises fees for software maintenance  training and consulting services including software implementation 
consulting services may be provided on a stand alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services 
software maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the related maintenance agreement  which in most cases is one year 

table of contents revenue from training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software maintenance  training services  and consulting services under time and materials contracts 
services may be provided on a fixed price basis 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for fixed price services prior to completion of the services 
when fixed price services are part of a multiple element arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement  and when services are the only undelivered element  we recognize the revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period 
in a limited number of our arrangements  the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement because we make significant alterations to the functionality of the software or build complex interfaces necessary for the software to be functional in the customer s environment 
we have not been able to make reasonably dependable estimates for the purpose of determining our progress to completion  as we have limited experience with these types of complex arrangements 
accordingly  all revenue and costs are deferred until the completion of the fixed price services 
revenue from fixed price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized as performed during the service period  which is typically less than four months 
we warrant that our software products will conform to documented specifications 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 
our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
we do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  we have not established any related reserves 
deferred project costs we defer direct costs when a project is being accounted for under the completed contract method or when using the full deferral method  based on hours incurred on such projects at average costs per hour 
we report these deferred project costs in other current assets 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of amounts of which billed fees exceed revenue recognized on arrangements  the unearned portion of services revenue and advance payment of maintenance fees 
when the value of committed and undelivered services to be delivered after license implementation is known  we defer that amount along with the corresponding cost of services until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer 
the timing of revenue recognized under our arrangements with customers is impacted by these deferrals  but the total value of revenue recognized during the arrangements is not 
allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for sales credit memos we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts using estimates that we make based on factors we believe appropriate such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
we record allowances for estimates of potential sales credit memos when the related revenue is recorded and review them periodically 
we base these estimates on historical analyses of sales credit memo data  current economic trends  assumptions about future events and experience with customer disputes 
if we used different assumptions in calculating the allowance  adjustments would be reflected as changes to revenue 
during the first quarter of  we refined our estimate of allowances for sales credit memos which resulted in an increase in services revenue of million 
stock based compensation we periodically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees  non employee directors and contractors with an exercise price greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
until january   we accounted for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb  accounting for stock options 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with stock awards to employees and directors was determined as the difference  if any  between the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date compensation was measured and the price the employee or director must pay to exercise the award 
the measurement date for employee and director awards is generally the date of grant 
prior to january   we disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our statement of income if we had employed the fair value method of accounting for stock option grants 
for purposes of that disclosure  we used a black scholes multiple pricing model to value the options granted which required us to make certain assumptions including the estimated life of options  the volatility of our stock price  the risk free rate of return and dividend yield 
our assumption regarding the average life of our options and the volatility of our stock was based on an analysis of our historical stock option exercises and stock price as reported by nasdaq over a period approximating the assumed average life of our options and ending on the date the determination was made 
our assumption regarding the risk free rate of return was based on us treasury note yields 
the dividend was equal to zero  as no dividends had been declared through december  stock options granted to 
table of contents contractors were accounted for using the fair value method 
under the fair value method  compensation associated with stock awards to contractors is determined based on the estimated fair value of the award itself  measured using either current market data or an established option pricing model 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based upon the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
the majority of our share based compensation arrangements vest over either a four or five year vesting schedule 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective approach  and  accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this approach  we are required to record compensation cost for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and for the unvested portion of all share based payments previously granted that remain outstanding based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas we expense share based compensation under the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
paragraph of fasb statement r provides that for the purposes of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits apic pool  the company should include the net excess tax benefits that would have qualified had the company adopted fasb r from inception 
the fasb issued fsp r  which provides an alternative transition method to calculate beginning pool of excess tax benefits 
the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method short cut method in calculating its historical apic pool of windfall tax benefits in regards to its share based compensation 
in  we estimated the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
key inputs used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected post vesting option life  the expected volatility of our stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
if the assumed year post vesting option life was one year longer or shorter  the fair value of options and the amount of expense would be up to higher or lower  respectively 
if the assumed volatility of our stock price was ten percentage points higher or lower  the fair value of options and the amount of expense would be up to higher or lower  respectively 
if the assumed risk free interest rate over the expected term of the options was up to two hundred basis points higher or lower  the fair value of options and the amount of expense would be up to higher or lower  respectively 
if the assumed dividend yield was one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of options and the amount of expense would be up to higher or lower 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive awards 
as required by sfas r  we reduce current expense for an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock options prior to vesting by employees whose employment with us terminates 
we base our estimate on an analysis of our history of forfeited options with similar vesting terms 
this estimate is trued up for actual forfeitures of options during vesting 
as of december   unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our employee stock options was approximately million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
during  there were no changes in the quantity or type of instruments used in share based payment programs  or the terms of share based payment arrangements 
cash received from option exercises under all share based payment arrangements for the year ended december  was million 
the actual tax benefit for the tax deductions from option exercises for the year ended december  totaled million 
the choice of a valuation technique  and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique  involve significant judgments 
these judgments reflect management s assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue  based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgments could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change over time  and any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 
during the second quarter of   unrestricted shares of our common stock were granted to members of our board of directors under the long term incentive plan 
as this award was unrestricted  no awards remain unvested as of september  the weighted average grant date value per share of the award was 
accounting for income taxes judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global 
table of contents business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties  transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries  and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact  unfavorable or favorable  on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
provisions have been made for such uncertainties  with reserves totaling approximately million as of december  we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
principal differences between our book and tax accounts are related to the treatment of our license transactions 
we use the operating lease method of recognizing license revenue for tax purposes  so that to the extent we continue to enter into term license contracts  we establish deferred tax liabilities for such future taxable income 
in addition  because we defer recognition of this income into future periods for tax purposes  as of december   we had generated approximately million in us tax loss carry forwards which partially offset the related liabilities 
we also earn tax credits in various jurisdictions for our ongoing investment in research and development activities 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million of credits carried forward because they would generally be utilized after net operating losses have been consumed exposing us to uncertainties regarding our ability to realize these credits 
we have a valuation allowance related to tax benefits from stock option exercises which will increase equity  and loss carry forwards acquired in the mind acquisition  the recognition of which will generally reduce goodwill 
if we are late in filing income taxes for foreign subsidiaries  the taxing authorities in those jurisdictions may levy punitive or jeopardy assessments which can grow over time 
the amounts billed during these periods may be much higher than what is ultimately owed 
during the delinquent period  the differences between estimated taxes and actual taxes ultimately owed may result in a higher income tax provision 
upon filing of the foreign income tax returns and claims for refund of overpayment  the taxing jurisdiction provides a notice of overpayment  if any  which is then recorded as a reduction to our provision for income taxes 
contingencies from time to time  we are threatened with or become party to litigation 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date  and we do not expect it to have a significant impact in the future 
our unbilled license and maintenance fees are typically subject to annual increases based on recognized inflation indices 
significant customers no customer accounted for or more of our total revenue in or in  one customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab which provides interpretations regarding the process of quantifying prior year financial statement misstatements for the purposes of a materiality assessment 
sab provides guidance that the following two methodologies should be used to quantify prior year income statement misstatements i the error is quantified as the amount by which the current period income statement is misstated and ii the error is quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
sab concludes that a company should evaluate whether a misstatement is material using both of these methodologies 
the interpretation is effective for evaluations made on or after november  the adoption of sab will not have a material effect on us 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas  which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately of our total revenue in from sales to customers based outside of the united states 
some of our international sales are denominated in foreign currencies  such as the british pound and euro 
the price in united states dollars of products and services sold outside the united states in foreign currencies will vary as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates against those foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance that sales denominated in foreign currencies will not be material in the future and that there will not be increases in the value of the united states dollar against such currencies that will reduce the dollar return to us on the sale of our products and services in such foreign currencies 
the foreign currency exposure related to revenue is largely offset by the expenses we incur in foreign currencies 
because most of our transactions with customers are invoiced from our offices in the us  and some of those transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have receivables and license installments that are valued in other currencies 
in addition  our us operating company holds some cash and investments in currencies other than the us dollar in order to support operations in other countries 
when there are changes in the exchange rates for those other currencies versus the us dollar functional currency we recognize a currency gain or loss in the statement of income as other income expense related to foreign currency transactions 
we had net assets valued in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of cash  investments  license installments  and receivables  partially offset by accounts payable and accruals  with a carrying value of million as of december  a ten percent change in currency exchange rates would change by approximately million the carrying value of those net assets as reported on our balance sheet as of december   with most of that change recognized in the statement of income as other income expense 
interest rate exposure our balance sheet contains interest bearing assets which have fixed rates of interest 
these assets include license installments receivable generated in the normal course of business through transactions with customers and investments of excess cash in marketable debt securities 
license installments receivable bear interest at the rate in effect when the license revenue was recognized  which does not vary throughout the life of the contractual cash flow stream 
we believe that at current market interest rates  the fair value of license installments receivable approximates the carrying value as reported on our balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurance that the fair market value will approximate the carrying value in the future 
factors such as increasing interest rates can reduce the fair market value of the license installments receivable 
changes in market rates do not affect net earnings  as the license installments receivable are carried at cost and  since they are not financial instruments and are held until maturity  are not marked to market to reflect changes in the fair value of the portfolio 
the carrying value of million as of december  reflects the weighted average of historic discount rates used to record each term license arrangement 
the average rate changes with market rates as new license installments receivable are added to the portfolio  which mitigates exposure to market interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our license installments receivable by approximately million as of december  we have invested in fixed rate marketable debt securities 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our marketable debt securities by approximately million as of december  changes in market rates and the related impact on fair value of the investments do not generally affect net earnings as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
