item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors certain factors that may affect our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview we are a global provider of software that secures digital identities and information 
over  enterprises and government agencies in more than countries use our solutions to help secure the digital lives of their citizens  customers  employees and partners 
our proven software and services can help customers achieve regulatory and corporate compliance  while helping to turn security challenges such as identity theft and loss of intellectual property into business opportunities 
we conduct business in one operating segment 
we develop  market and sell software solutions that secure digital identities and information 
we also perform professional services to install  support and integrate our software solutions with other applications 
all of these activities may be fulfilled in conjunction with partners and are managed through our global organization 
as an innovator and pioneer in the internet security field  entrust s market leadership and expertise in delivering award winning identity and data protection management software solutions is demonstrated by the diversity of our products  geographic representation  and customer segments 
we continue to drive revenue in our key products 
on july  we acquired business signatures corporation business signatures 
business signatures is a provider of zero touch fraud detection solutions 
unlike other fraud detection solutions  the business signatures efraud product provides a real time fraud detection capability that requires no changes to the business application 
organizations can rapidly deploy the solution and begin passively monitoring user activity quickly identifying and responding to suspicious behavior 
this capability also allows for sophisticated fraud analytics to be performed to identify and respond to evolving threats 
the zero touch nature of the efraud product helps allow organizations to take advantage of these capabilities in a fraction of the time compared to other approaches 
with the addition of business signatures  entrust now has three key platforms  authentication  transaction monitoring and information protection 
we now have a unique end to end platform for securing digital identities and information 
this end to end software platform is easy to implement  user friendly and cost effective with the ability to evolve over time and grow with our customers needs 
two of entrust s platforms  authentication and transaction monitoring  come together to provide a new level of assurance for both internal and external parties  through risk based authentication 
as we all know  every transaction is not created equally 
an online banking customer that only views their account balances is performing a very different level of transaction than someone that is transferring  out of their account  or adding new bill payees 
in every transaction the level of risk grows as the dollar value of the transaction grows 
risk based authentication allows for the proper level of security to be implemented based on the sensitivity of any given transaction 
entrust offers a range of authentication capabilities with its authentication platform so that specific methods can be used with specific users and applications 
first steps can be as simple as deploying ssl certificates or user name and password 
entrust has long played a key role in this market space through our ssl and single sign on products 

table of contents risk based authentication however goes much deeper than ssl and single sign on 
risk based authentication is having the ability to judge each individual transaction on its own merits driven by policy level decisions on the level of risk associated with certain transactions 
with entrust s risk based authentication solution  transactions can be monitored in real time and then a determination can be made on the level of security required for that transaction 
this solution combines entrust identityguard and entrust transactionguard 
this combined offering is a modern architecture for consumer authentication which has a layered approach of non invasive anomaly detection and selective intervention with minimal impact on the user experience 
at the end of  financial institutions in the united states needed to offer stronger security measures for online customers according to the federal financial institutions examination council s ffiec guidance 
the financial institutions want the easiest and most cost effective solution 
we are well positioned with a wide portfolio that allows the financial institutions to start with an easy  cost effective solution to meet the initial requirements and then utilize our full risk based authentication platform to provide additional layers of security in the coming years 
product category financial metrics emerging growth products identityguard  boundary messaging  and fraud detection accounted for million in q   or of product revenue  up from million in q  and up from million in q  for the full year ending emerging growth products reached million  an increase of over  accounting for of product revenue 
pki products accounted for million in q   or of product revenue  up from million in q  and up from million in q  single sign on products accounted for million in q   or of product revenue  down from million in q  and up from million in q  we also provide support services and professional services  including architecture  installation  and integration services related to the products that we sell 
these services represent a significant portion of our revenues  but are closely related to the demand for our products 
in addition  the margins on our products are significantly higher than margins on our services 
as a result  we are primarily focused on growing our product revenues 
entrust sells its solutions globally  with an emphasis on north america  europe and asia 
these primary areas have demonstrated the most potential for early adoption of the broadest set of entrust solutions 
entrust extends to other non core geographies through strategic partner relationships  which increases the leverage of our direct sales channel worldwide 
in north america  entrust is targeting a return to revenue growth in its software business by leveraging entrust s historical strength in selling to key verticals such as government federal  state  provincial  financial services and healthcare organizations 
europe is a region where entrust s products and solutions continue to experience strong demand and we believe that the european market will provide growth  with increased momentum from governments and enterprises leveraging entrust s solutions to transform their business processes and to leverage the internet and networking applications 
we market and sell our products and services in both the enterprise and government market space 
in  of our product sales were in our extended government vertical market  which includes healthcare 
this revenue has been driven by key global projects that have started to increase product purchases 
in the extended government vertical market  we have a strong penetration in the us federal government  the governments of canada  singapore  denmark  the united kingdom and across continental europe 
in fact  entrust now counts of the top e governments  as outlined by this year s accenture report  as customers 

table of contents a key change in the government space has been the movement from purely internal security solutions that our customers require to more external citizen facing applications 
these projects include epassports  national id programs  physical and logical access programs for government employees  and a growing number of citizen facing applications 
security is at the core of all these projects and our wide product set positions entrust well in this space 
we have already announced three epassport projects that entrust has won  we have been selected as the infrastructure for a number of national id and ministry of defense programs  and we are well positioned in a number of employee credentialing projects like the us hspd program 
we also won an identityguard strong authentication solution for a key citizen facing application for the us federal government 
large government projects involve government bureaucracies  large system integrators and differing technical requirements 
in order to help us better navigate through these opportunities  we have bolstered our government team with addition of andrew pinder  the former e envoy for the government of the united kingdom 
during andrew s tenure as e envoy  the uk received acclaim for becoming a leading e government and e business leader 
andrew brings a wealth of additional experience as he served as the head of european operations and technology at citibank 
he also held positions as the director of operations and technology at prudential corporation and as director of information technology at the office of inland revenue in the uk 
andrew will help lead our global government efforts on projects such as the move to epassports  national id cards and securing citizen identities and information 
andrew is joining entrust as senior vice president  government solutions  reporting to the ceo 
previously  andrew had served on our board of directors 
in  of our product sales were in our extended enterprise vertical market 
we continue to see demand from global enterprises as they continue to respond to regulatory and governance compliance demands and extend their internal and external networks to more and more individuals inside and outside their domain 
we have experienced a change in the shape of many enterprise deals 
specifically  enterprises are buying for their immediate need and then adding to their purchases as the projects begin roll out 
our largest vertical within the enterprise market is the financial services vertical 
in the fourth quarter of  financial services revenue increased from the previous quarter and from a year ago 
financial institutions are focused on ffiec and other global compliance regulations  which we believe drove demand for our risk based authentication and messaging solutions 
a key driver of our product growth has been the recent spotlight on identity theft due to breaches at companies like choicepoint and lexisnexis 
these breaches have proven that self regulation over the past few years has been insufficient at addressing the underlying issues 
recent legislation has addressed these concerns 
california sb has cast more visibility on the issue for citizens  corporations  and the government 
the law requires both corporations and the government to notify california residents if their sensitive data has been breached unless encryption technology is deployed 
additionally  other states have now passed breach notification requirements 
on a national level  bills are being written to protect citizens from identity theft and alert them if their information has been stolen 
entrust for years has been a leader in securing digital identities and information 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced identityguard which is our easy to use second factor of authentication solution 
we now have pilots under way for identityguard 
in q  identityguard accounted for million dollars of product revenue 
identityguard s low cost relative to hardware  its simplicity for the mass market  and its effectiveness in countering online theft and phishing  are the key drivers for the increased revenue growth we are experiencing 
along with the revenue growth for second factor authentication  we are also seeing customers increasingly interested in data protection and encryption 
with a combination of entrust identityguard  getaccess and truepass  customers can accomplish authentication and role based access control  digital signature  and encryption from one solution provider 
entrust has a goal to develop new channels to market  in addition to our direct sales force 
in q   of our transactions were fulfilled through partners  helping us achieve our revenue increase 
this success was driven by north american channel partners  which now totals in the trustedpartner program 

table of contents in april  entrust introduced a managed pki service 
this service was launched in response to customer requests for entrust to offer a hosted service to give them a choice between a service offering for pki certificates and our traditional pki software purchase option 
our service offering is designed to help enterprises and government agencies grow and accelerate their core business security  without having to develop pki expertise internally 
our managed service offering will allow our customers the flexibility to now have our market leading technology delivered in an outsourced service model 
in december  the entrust managed pki service made the general services administration gsa list of approved shared service providers 
this status enables entrust to help federal agencies reap the security benefits of pki without having to maintain the certification authority ca themselves 
this is not our first entrance into the services arena 
we have been helping our customers for years design  deploy and manage our solutions 
we have also been successful in growing our ssl certificate business  which increased over in with the introduction of the new extended validation ssl certificates we should be able to grow this business at least that same rate in our new managed pki service offering will give us access to a new market of customers that can help us drive both additional license revenue  as well as new ratable services revenues 
entrust in the past has relied significantly on large deals in each quarter 
we have over the past few years reduced this dependence  but they remain a significant portion of our product revenue on a quarterly basis 
our software revenue from our top five customers in q  was approximately of our total revenue in that quarter and we had two product deals over million and one deal that contributed million to total revenue in the quarter 
these numbers were within our historical range  which is generally between and of revenue from the top five customers and zero to four transactions over million 
we continue to be impacted from time to time on our software revenue by the timing of our customers buying process  which may include proof of concepts  senior management reviews and budget delays that sometimes results in longer than anticipated sales cycles 
we are also impacted by our customers recent buying behavior  which is to buy only for immediate need as opposed to making a larger purchase in order to get a better discount 
any of these factors may impact our revenue on a quarterly basis 
our management uses the following metrics to measure performance number and average size of product revenue transactions  number of deals over million  top five product revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues  product revenue split between extended enterprise and extended government verticals  product revenue split between three key product areas emerging growth markets  public key infrastructure and single sign on  geographic revenue split  product and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues  and deferred revenue  cash and marketable investment balances 
business overview during  we continued our strategy of focusing on core vertical and geographic markets 
revenues of million represented a decrease over  and consisted of product sales and services and 
table of contents maintenance 
services and maintenance revenues decreased over  due to decreased demand for both consulting services and support and maintenance services  while product revenues increased from  primarily driven by an improved product transaction closure rate compared to  despite a lower average purchase value compared to net loss in was million  or per share  compared to a net income of million  or per share in  with total expenses increasing to million in  due in part to the million adjustment to our restructuring accrual related to our california facility and million of equity compensation expense related to stock options 
in addition  we recorded a write down of million related to our investments in asia digital media and ohana 
we generated million in cash flow from operations in  compared to net cash used in operations of million in entrust emerging growth products entrust identityguard  boundary messaging and fraud detection accounted for of product revenue  which is an increase of from entrust pki products accounted for of product revenue  which is a decrease of from entrust certificate services revenues  a component of our pki product solutions suite  increased over entrust single sign on products accounted for of product revenue  which is a decrease of from overall  extended government accounted for and extended enterprise accounted for of the product revenue in the financial services sector of the extended enterprise vertical accounted for approximately of product revenues  an increase of over  driven by increased demand for multi factor authentication  zero touch fraud detection and boundary messaging 
other highlights from included the average purchase size in was  which was a decrease from  in total transactions in reached  which is up from transactions in we added new customers in  compared to new customers in deferred revenue was million  which is an increase of million or from entrust identityguard revenue included in the emerging growth products revenue achieved million of product revenue  compared with million of revenue in  a increase 
entrust identityguard transactions reached in  up from in entrust identityguard pilots and trials reached by the end of in the fourth quarter of  us bank became entrust s first risk based authentication customer with its initial purchase of entrust identityguard 
entrust s boundary messaging product revenue was million included in the emerging growth products revenue in  which is an increase of over as part of our share purchase program  we purchased thousand shares in for million at an average share price of 
we acquired business signatures  a leading supplier of zero touch fraud detection solutions that provide non invasive real time online fraud detection capability and that require no change to business applications  based in redwood city  california 
we also acquired orion security solutions  a leading supplier of pki to defense related governmental agencies 
as we are already a leader in providing identity and information security to the united states civilian government agencies  this acquisition adds key defense agencies to the entrust customer base 
we ended with million in cash and marketable securities and no debt 
the decline in cash and marketable securities from million at the end of was primarily due to the acquisitions of business signatures and orion security solutions 
we released entrust transactionguard  the latest iteration of our zero touch software based monitoring tool that identifies potential fraudulent behavior and access patterns across the online channel 
this version is fully integrated with entrust identityguard  enabling organizations to deploy a complete risk based authentication solution for protecting end users 
we announced that we are offering extended validation ev ssl certificates for use with the next generation of ev aware browsers 
entrust extended validation ssl certificates commonly referred to 
table of contents as ev certificates are expected to be an effective tool for helping to rebuild consumer confidence in online transactions by enabling strong visual cues that notify a user that a site is secure 
the new technology can help increase consumer confidence by displaying prominent and consistent trust indicators in a browser s address bar 
in addition  entrust was the first ssl vendor to activate ev ssl certificates for windows xp users with internet explorer our managed pki service was added to the general services administration list of approved shared service providers 
this status enables entrust to help us federal agencies reap the security benefits of pki without having to maintain the certification authority themselves 
this status also enables entrust to service federal government agencies needing to meet hspd and beyond 
we announced entrust entelligence group share which helps organizations protect data stored on corporate networks in a manner that is automatic and transparent to the end user and persistent 
with zero touch folder administration  entrust entelligence group share offers unprecedented manageability allowing the ability to change permissions on a shared folder without having to modify the folder or its contents eliminating the need to re encrypt data when permissions are changed 
critical accounting policies in  our most complex accounting judgments were made in the areas of software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring charges and related adjustments  accounting for long term strategic and equity investments  purchase accounting  the provision for income taxes and stock based compensation 
the restructuring and related charges are not anticipated to be recurring in nature 
however  the financial reporting of restructuring and related charges will continue to require judgments until such time as the corresponding accruals are fully paid out and or no longer required 
software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for long term strategic and equity investments  purchase accounting  provision for income taxes and stock based compensation are expected to continue to be ongoing elements of our critical accounting processes and judgments 
software revenue recognition with respect to software revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgments to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the specifics of each transaction  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenues and cost recognized 
different judgments and or different contract structures could lead to different accounting conclusions  which could have a material effect on our reported earnings 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized when we have received an executed license agreement or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  the software has been shipped if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  the fees are fixed and determinable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
license revenues are generated both through direct sales to end users as well as through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
license revenue is recognized when the sale has occurred for an identified end user  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we are notified of a sale by a reseller to the end user customer in the same period that the product is delivered through to the end user customer 
we do not offer a right of return on sales of our software products 

table of contents we do not generally include acceptance provisions in arrangements with customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the documented agreement 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable at the outset  we recognize revenue when the fee becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess if collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we do not record revenue until such time as collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we are sometimes subject to fiscal funding clauses in our software licensing transactions with the united states government and its agencies 
such clauses generally provide that the license is cancelable if the legislature or funding authority does not appropriate the funds necessary for the governmental unit to fulfill its obligations under the licensing arrangement 
in these circumstances  software licensing arrangements with governmental organizations containing a fiscal funding clause are evaluated to determine whether the uncertainty of a possible license arrangement cancellation is remote 
if the likelihood of cancellation is assessed as remote  then the software licensing arrangement is considered non cancelable and the related software licensing revenue is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
these elements may include two or more of the following software licenses  maintenance and support  consulting services and training 
for arrangements where vendor specific objective evidence is not available for a delivered element  we first allocate the arrangement fee to the undelivered elements based on the total fair value of those undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence 
this portion of the arrangement fee is deferred 
then the difference residual between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we attribute the discount offered in a multiple element arrangement entirely to the delivered elements of the transaction  which are typically software licenses 
fair values for the future maintenance and support services are based upon substantially similar sales of renewals of maintenance and support contracts to other customers 
fair value of future services  training or consulting services is based upon substantially similar sales of these services to other customers 
in some instances  a group of contracts or agreements with the same customer may be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single multiple element arrangement  and therefore  we would undertake to allocate the corresponding revenues amongst the various components  as described above 
we also eliminate intercompany profits on revenue transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries that are accounted for under the equity method to the extent of our ownership interest in that related party  if the product and or services have not been sold through to an unrelated third party end user customer 
our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
when the customization is essential to the 
table of contents functionality of the licensed software  then both the software license and consulting services revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which requires revenue to be recognized based upon the percentage of work effort completed on the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain doubtful accounts allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including previous transactions with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
we base our ongoing estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on the aging of the balances in the accounts receivable  our historical collection patterns and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of not collecting a specific account receivable becomes probable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best information available to us and is re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we exhaust all avenues and methods of collection  including the use of third party collection agencies  before writing off a customer balance as uncollectible 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
each circumstance in which we conclude that a provision for non payment by a customer may be required must be carefully considered in order to determine the true factors leading to that potential non payment to ensure that it is proper for it to be categorized as an allowance for bad debts 
we have focused on improving our accounts receivable aging and  as a result  had been able to reduce our corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts in and in the process 
however  a significant change in the financial condition of a major customer  such as the european distributor discussed below  could have a material impact on our estimates regarding the sufficiency of our allowance 
our accounts receivable include material balances from a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for of gross accounts receivable at december   compared to of gross accounts receivable at december  no customer accounted for or more of net accounts receivable at december  for more information on our customer concentration  see our related discussion in risk factors 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying this assessment or changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  and the timing of information related to the change in financial condition could result in a different assessment of the existing credit risk of our accounts receivable and thus  a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on our reported earnings 
during  we became aware of financial concerns regarding one of our european distributors and  as a result  we concluded that it was necessary to record an increase to our provision for doubtful accounts  which accounted for the majority of the increase in this provision for the year  as a charge against sales and marketing expenses 
during  we reached a settlement agreement on a significant and long outstanding receivable related to a license agreement executed in june this receivable had been completely provided for in fiscal  because it was our determination then that the likelihood of default was probable  despite the fact that we had undertaken all avenues of collection available to us  including litigation 
as part of the process of pursuing collection through the court system  we entered into settlement discussions with the customer 
as a result of these discussions  a settlement was reached under which full payment of the original invoiced amount of million was assured upon execution of a new agreement 
in total  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million due to the settlement 
as part of this settlement agreement  we also agreed to provide this customer with additional software products and professional services  the related costs of which were provided for from the allowance that had previously been set up against the receivable 
in  the 
table of contents remaining allowance in the amount of million was reversed against sales and marketing expenses as a recovery of this bad debt 
in a separate matter  during  the company collected thousand that had been outstanding over days and had previously been fully reserved 
the balance of thousand was reversed against sales and marketing expense as a recovery of bad debt during that year 
in  the company collected thousand that had been outstanding over days and had previously been fully reserved 
the balance of thousand was reversed against sales and marketing expense as a recovery of bad debt during that year 
restructuring charges and adjustments june restructuring plan on june   we announced that our board of directors had approved a restructuring plan to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that were negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring plan and the impact of macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the second quarter of  with a subsequent reduction of million in the first half of in the second quarter of  we made a further adjustment to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to the june restructuring plan by million to reflect a change in our projected sublet lease recoveries for our santa clara  california facility 
we concluded that this was required as a result of our realization that the market for leased facilities in that region will not recover in the timeframe that we had estimated  as evidenced by significantly lower projected sublease rates for our facility as supplied to us by our external real estate advisors 
we also recorded a million reduction to our june restructuring accrual in the third quarter of  as a result of the july settlement of an existing contractual obligation under a marketing and distribution agreement  at a value significantly less than the full accrued obligation 
during the first and second quarters of  we made further adjustments to the restructuring charges that had previously been recorded related to the june restructuring plan with respect to our santa clara  california facility 
the building is currently subleased  but the current sublease was scheduled to end in december although we had been monitoring the sublet market on an on going basis  the extension offer we received during the first quarter of  coupled with the preparations we had begun for placing the facility on the market  caused us to revisit our estimated sublease recoveries at that time 
we had concluded that we would need to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to our june restructuring plan by a further million in the first quarter of fiscal to reflect a change in our projected sublet lease recoveries as evidenced by the market for leased facilities in that region 
this charge represented a reduction in the cash that we expected to recover from future subtenants 
during the second quarter of  we concluded an extension agreement with the current sublessee to sublease the california facility through to march   which represents substantially all of the remaining lease period on the building 
as a result of the conclusion of the final sublease arrangement during the second quarter of  we adjusted our accrual related to the june restructuring downward by thousand to reflect the known sublet lease recoveries under the extension agreement 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the original accrued restructuring charges of million at june   including estimating future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  liabilities from employee severances  and costs to exit business activities 
however  as at december   due to the conclusion of the extension agreement with the subtenant in connection with our california facility  the 
table of contents remaining estimated sublease recoveries included in our restructuring accrual  that are not currently contracted under existing sublease agreements  are insignificant 
our only remaining exposure is if the subtenant defaults on the sublease  which in our judgment is unlikely 
the restructuring plan announced on june  was completed by june assuming the continued financial viability of the subtenant at the california facility  no further charges are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
may restructuring plan on may   we announced a restructuring plan aimed at lowering costs and better aligning our resources to customer needs 
the plan allows us to have tighter integration between the groups in our organization that interact with customers  which better positions us to take advantage of the market opportunities for our new products 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of employee positions to lower operating costs  closing of under utilized office space  and re assessing the value of related excess long lived assets 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the restructuring charges of million  including estimating liabilities related to employee severance  future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  and other costs to exit activities 
changes in these assessments with respect to the accrued restructuring charges for the may restructuring plan of million at december  could have a material effect on our reported results 
in addition  actual results could vary from these assumptions and estimates  in particular with regard to the sublet of excess facilities  resulting in an adjustment that could have a material effect on our future financial results 
our accrual related to the may restructuring at december  includes a total of million of estimated sublease recoveries  which may be subject to adjustment based upon changes in the real estate sublet markets 
the restructuring plan announced on may  was completed by december  no further changes are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
accounting for long term strategic investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of strategic investments on an on going basis  but at least annually 
factors that we consider important in determining whether an assessment is warranted and could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model and changes in overall market conditions 
these investments are in private companies  of which we typically own less than of the outstanding stock 
we account for these investments under the cost method 
because there is not a liquid market for these securities  we often must make estimates of the value of our investments 
as a result of the rescission agreement discussed in the next section  as of december   we held an investment in ohana  in the amount of thousand  representing approximately of the issued common shares of ohana 
this investment is now accounted for under the cost method 
by december   we had recorded cumulative losses related to our million investment in ohana of thousand since the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  we were informed of an ohana re financing  which coupled with the changes in the business outlook  led us to conclude that the expectations for ohana had not materialized and an impairment charge was required to adjust the net carrying value of our equity ownership 
as a result  we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal an impairment of our investment in ohana of thousand 
no amount of the charge will result in future cash expenditures 
after this impairment  the remaining carrying value of our investment in ohana was thousand at december  
table of contents accounting for equity investments as of december   we held an investment that we account for under the equity basis of accounting  which represents our equity ownership in asia digital media 
asia digital media is a joint venture  involving us and several other investors  formed for the purpose of delivering secure technology solutions enabling hdtv satellite broadcasting  high speed internet and on line transaction services to the chinese market 
our investment in asia digital media began as a loan to ohana of thousand in  which was convertible into equity of ohana 
in the second quarter of this was increased to thousand 
in july  this loan was further increased to million 
this amount was further increased to million in the fourth quarter of we determined that the loan was unlikely to be repaid but rather expected it to be converted into equity in adml holdings  ltd 
adml holdco  once ohana became a wholly owned subsidiary of adml holdco in connection with the ohana restructuring 
on an as converted basis at september   we would have owned approximately of adml holdco exclusive of the anticipated final disbursement in the fourth quarter of 
beginning the third quarter of  we had accounted for our investment in ohana under the equity method  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we included our share of post acquisition losses of ohana  prior to the ohana restructuring  in the amount of thousand in our consolidated net income for the fiscal year 
the ohana restructuring closed on november  and we received approximately of the issued common shares of adml holdco  together with a warrant that would have become exercisable for additional shares of adml holdco upon the happening of certain events 
on september   the company and certain other investors agreed to subscribe for shares in a newly formed joint venture called asia digital media pursuant to a subscription agreement as amended  the subscription agreement 
the investment closed on december  we directly subscribed for approximately of the share capital of asia digital media in exchange for a cash contribution of million and in kind contributions of software products and professional services totaling million 
of this amount  million was recorded on account of the in kind contributions as revenue in the fourth quarter of  net of intercompany profit eliminations 
also  adml holdco  in which we held an approximate ownership interest for our million investment  directly subscribed for of the share capital of asia digital media in exchange for a contribution of the entire issued share capital of ohana 
the remaining capital stock of asia digital media is owned by two investors and china aerospace new world technology limited  a company incorporated in hong kong 
during the first quarter of  we received additional shares of common stock of asia digital media in reimbursement for legal costs incurred by us on behalf of asia digital media during its formation and for administrative services that we provided 
these additional shares were valued at thousand and resulted in an increase of our total direct and indirect equity holdings in asia digital media to as of september  on december   we entered into the rescission agreement with asia digital media and adml holdco to rescind the subscription agreement in part  resulting in the return of the shares of asia digital media issued to adml holdco for cancellation and the corresponding return of the entire issued capital of ohana to adml holdco 
upon conclusion of the procedures required to give effect to the rescission agreement  we owned approximately of the issued share capital of asia digital media and approximately of the issued share capital of ohana 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  we have accounted for our investment in asia digital media under the equity method 
accordingly  as of december   we have included our share of post acquisition losses of asia digital media  in the cumulative amount of million in our consolidated net income since the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents upon execution of the rescission agreement  we have no commitments or other arrangements to provide funding for any shortfalls adml holdco may incur  and there are no variable interests with respect to adml holdco  other than its common stock interest of 
therefore  fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
r is not applicable to this investment 
we have concluded that asia digital media does not meet the definition of a variable interest entity  as described in fin no 
r 
as the company began initial operations in december  engaging primarily in research and development  and having no revenue  we determined that asia digital media was a development stage enterprise 
furthermore  the capitalization of asia digital media anticipated the raising of additional equity to fund the scaled production pilot and commercial roll out 
however  the cash invested in asia digital media by investors of million  was expected to be sufficient equity to fund the initial development stage  which is defined as implementation of a pilot system with all specified functions in a limited commercial environment 
in addition  we determined that each shareholder of asia digital media shares in the risk of loss and that the shareholders  as a group  share the returns 
finally  we concluded that asia digital media does not operate substantively on behalf of one entity that receives a disproportionately fewer voting rights to avoid consolidation 
during the first quarter of  we were informed of changes in our chinese partner s ability to invest in the second funding round of asia digital media 
this factor  among others  had significant negative implications for asia digital media 
we concluded that expectations for asia digital media had not materialized and an impairment charge was required to adjust the net carrying value of our equity ownership 
as a result  we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal an impairment of our investment in asia digital media in the amount of million 
no amount of the charge will result in future cash expenditures 
after this impairment  the remaining carrying value of our investment in asia digital media was thousand at december  we have received one or more expressions of interest from third parties who wish to acquire our remaining equity in adml holdco  but no term sheet or transaction has been signed by us 
purchase accounting in june  we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of orion  based in mclean  virginia  while on july   we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and options of business signatures  based in redwood city  california 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase prices were allocated to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
in determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired  we are required to make significant assumptions and judgments regarding such things as the estimated future cash flows that we believe will be generated as a result of the acquisition of customer partner relationships  purchased product rights and workforce  and the estimated useful life of these acquired intangible assets 
we believe that our assumptions and resulting conclusions are the most appropriate based on existing information and market expectations 
however  different assumptions and judgments as to future events could have resulted in different fair values being allocated to the intangible assets acquired 
we will review these assets for impairment in future  in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which require goodwill to be reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
provision for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to assess our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states 
in addition  we have based the calculation of our income taxes in each jurisdiction upon inter company agreements  which could be challenged by tax authorities in these jurisdictions 
the income tax accounting process involves our determining our actual 
table of contents current exposure in each jurisdiction together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue and accrued restructuring charges  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   which offsets deferred income tax assets relating to united states and foreign net operating loss nol and tax credit carry forwards in the amount of million and million of deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
this valuation allowance represents the full value of our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets as a result of our recent history of financial losses 
therefore  our balance sheet includes no net deferred tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the timing of the temporary differences becoming deductible 
we consider  among other available information  historical earnings  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and other matters in making this assessment 
until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance and will not record any benefit from the deferred tax assets 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of not being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin no 
seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
the provisions of fin no 
will be effective for us as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently in the process of completing the work necessary to finalize the implementation of fin no 
in the first quarter of  but we do not expect that our analysis will lead us to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings in connection with any tax positions that we have taken in current or prior years  which are more likely than not of not being sustained on audit 
therefore  we expect that the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation our stock award program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to our success by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing shareholders 
stock based awards may be granted to employees when they first join us  when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
stock based awards may also be granted in specific circumstances for retention or reward purposes 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional awards to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock based award plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant  become exercisable at varying rates  generally over three or four years 
options issued before april   generally expire ten years from the date of grant  awards issued on or after april   generally expire seven years from the date of grant 
beginning in  the compensation committee of the board of directors has issued performance stock units to certain key employees 
these performance grants are based on the achievement of certain pre determined 
table of contents criteria such as budgeted level of revenue attainment or target stock price 
the associated compensation expense is accrued at the time that the performance criteria are reasonably certain to be achieved 
we recognize that stock options and other stock based incentive awards dilute existing shareholders and have attempted to control the number granted while remaining competitive with our compensation packages 
the compensation committee of the board of directors oversees the granting of all stock based incentive awards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r which supersedes apb opinion no 
and requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize that cost over the service period 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first annual period beginning after june  and  therefore  we began recognizing compensation expense related to employee stock awards from and after january  sfas r requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating awards expected to vest including type of awards  employee class  and our historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of our stock options 
those assumptions include estimating  the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock over the expected term  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate expected during the option term and the expected dividends to be paid 
we have reviewed each of these assumptions carefully and determined our best estimate for these variables 
of these assumptions  the expected volatility of our common stock is the most difficult to estimate since it is based on expected performance of our common stock 
we use the implied volatility of historical market prices for our common stock on the public stock market to estimate expected volatility 
an increase in the expected volatility  expected term  and risk free interest rate  all will cause an increase in compensation expense 
the dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
for the year ended december  compensation expense of million was recognized for stock options  rsus and sars  of which million of stock option expense was as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
total remaining compensation estimated to be recognized over the remaining service periods for these awards is million 
this compensation cost included estimation of expected forfeitures 
forfeiture estimations are based on analysis of historical forfeiture rates 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our results of operations 
the continued impact of sfas no 
r will depend on levels of share based awards granted in the future 
in general  the annual stock based compensation expense is expected to decline in future years when compared to the expense reported in prior years in our pro forma stock based compensation disclosures 
this decline is primarily the result of a change in stock based compensation strategy as determined by management 

table of contents in addition to ongoing recognition of stock based compensation expense  we recognized a one time cumulative transition adjustment in the first quarter of a reduction of thousand in compensation expense was made related to the effect of estimated forfeitures on outstanding awards 
this adjustment was to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  to reflect the compensation cost that would not have been recognized in prior periods had forfeitures been estimated during those periods 
this adjustment applies only to compensation cost previously recognized in fiscal related to rsus and sars awards granted in that year

while the higher volume of emerging growth product transactions worked to improve our product revenues in  our overall revenues were impacted as these deals tend to carry less professional services requirements 
the overall decline for compared to was in part due to the extended government market 
for extended government revenues in the united states were million  representing an decrease from million in  which in turn  was a increase over the level of non north american revenues has fluctuated from period to period and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we believe the significant increase in revenues outside of north america from to  reflected the strength of our evolving product portfolio  distribution network  strong customer relationships and the quality of our support and services 
the improvement outside north america in was experienced in both the enterprise and government markets  while extended government revenues in the united states also grew to million in  representing a increase over in  a single customer accounted for of revenues  while one other customer accounted for of revenues

table of contents the increase in product revenues for when compared to is primarily due to our emerging growth products  namely identityguard  boundary messaging and fraud detection  which benefited from the addition of business signatures in the second half of the year 
this trend was also helped by resurgence in our pki products in the last quarter of sales of these products have grown to represent of total product revenues in  an increase of from our new products first gained traction in  with revenue from our target areas of identityguard  secure gateway messaging and device certificates accounting for over of total product revenues in that year  which underpinned our total product revenue growth of from  particularly outside of north america 
as a result  we have experienced higher product transaction closure rates 
highlighting this trend  our product revenue transactions a product revenue transaction is defined as a product sale in excess of thousand grew to in  up from in  or an increase  which in turn was up from product revenue transactions in  or an increase of 
this growth in was the result of an improvement in the closure rate for deals under thousand  despite our difficulty in closing deals over a million dollars  closing just three product deals in excess of one million dollars in  compared to five in in addition  the revenues generated from government customers were down in  representing of product revenues compared to in  mainly due to a reduction in large government pki deals in new project purchases remain subject to governmental budgetary constraints  particularly in the united states  so that these revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
our new customer count remained flat from to  while it grew by in compared to the average product revenue transaction size decreased from thousand in to thousand in  or a decrease of  after the average product revenue transaction size decreased from thousand in this downward trend in transaction size is due to a shift in our product mix toward our lower cost emerging growth products 
in general  the top five average quarterly product revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues declined from and in and  respectively  to in this decrease in average product revenue transaction size and the decline in the top five average product revenue transactions are consistent with our expectations  due to the increased level of product transactions and improved volume of transactions involving new products 
product revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in when compared to and  due to a stronger demand for products  relative to the demand for services

the decrease in services and maintenance revenues for compared to is due to a shift in demand to our emerging growth products  which require less professional services to implement  deploy and integrate  than our pki and single sign on solutions 
also  third party hardware revenues were significantly lower in compared to  because of a significant hardware order of million  which bolstered services revenues in we have also experienced lower canadian government professional services revenues in and a shift in services that has accompanied our growth in us channel partners revenues 
services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues for decreased compared to due to improvement in product revenues combined with a decrease in services and maintenance revenues 

table of contents the improved revenue for was primarily due to a million growth in support and maintenance revenues when compared to  largely as a result of the addition of entrust japan in late also  we believed this support revenue performance reflected the value our products provided to our customers globally  the increasing customer deployment of our solutions and the level of service quality that our support and maintenance team delivered 
in addition  we had been fulfilling our customers deployment needs to a greater degree in in conjunction with partners  as our solutions had become easier to deploy and consequently  we saw an increase in services revenue over driven by increased third party services and hardware revenue globally 
the decrease in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to reflected the shift in the mix of revenues from services and maintenance revenues to product  largely due to the strength of demand for our products offerings relative to the demand for services and maintenance business

total expenses of million in represented an increase of from million in this increase from to was due primarily to the impact of additional costs associated with stock option compensation  increased headcount primarily due to acquisitions  marketing programs  outside professional services  amortization of purchased intangible assets  an unfavorable shift in foreign exchange between the united states and canadian dollars  a provision recorded against accounts receivable balances with one of our european distributors  and an adjustment to our restructuring accruals of million related to our excess santa clara facility  offset by lower facility depreciation costs for leasehold improvements at our ottawa facility and lower third party hardware expenses 
as of december   we had full time employees globally  compared to full time employees at december  total expenses of million in represented an increase of from million in this increase from to was due primarily to the impact of royalties for third party technology that is embedded in our solutions of million  incremental cost of million in related to the acquisition of entrust japan in september and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million principally between the united states and canadian dollars

the increase in the cost of product revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of product revenues of from to is primarily attributable to several large product revenue transactions that carried third party software royalties in we expect that this trend will continue in the immediate future 
the increase in cost of product revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of product revenues of from to was primarily due to the product mix  which included more third party products and therefore  increased royalties 
the mix of third party products and the relative gross margins achieved with respect to these products may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected

year over year change year ended december  millions to to staff related costs outside professional services third party hardware facilities related costs total the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars for when compared to  can be attributed primarily to the reduced facilities related costs due to lower depreciation on our ottawa facility  reduced third party hardware expenses and reduced other outside service costs 
the third party hardware costs were much higher in because of a significant hardware order from a customer during that year 
the increased staff related costs from to are primarily related to stock option compensation expenses and increased compensation costs associated with existing resources 
the average number of employees on our services and maintenance teams decreased by overall  from to in response to the decline in demand for consulting and integration services  despite the increased resources added as a result of the acquisition of orion in june and business signatures in july services and maintenance expenses as a percentage of total revenues were consistent between and  which was the net result of lower overall services and maintenance expenses accounting for a one percentage point decrease in the services and maintenance expenses as a percentage of total revenues  while the lower total revenues in resulted in a one percentage point increase  compared to 
table of contents cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars for increased when compared to  due to the effect of increased costs associated with third party hardware and royalty maintenance fees of million 
also  we increased our investment in our support and maintenance and professional services teams by million in principally due to the acquisition of entrust japan in september the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to is primarily due to improved overall revenues  resulting in a three percentage point decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
this was offset by the shift in the mix of services and maintenance revenues toward third party services and hardware  which are lower margin revenues  and increased spending on entrust japan service operations 
services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues was for  for and for the decrease in services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues in  compared to  was primarily attributable to lower professional services revenues  particularly in canada  which accounted for the two percentage point decrease  partly offset by a one percentage point increase due to improved support and maintenance margins in compared to the decrease in services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues for  compared to  was primarily due to the net impact of declined north american professional services margins as a result of lower utilization of available professional services resources and a greater volume of lower margin third party services and hardware revenues  meaning higher relative costs associated with professional services in light of this revenue performance 
this accounted for a two percentage point decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues for  when compared to however  support and maintenance margins improved due to higher revenues from strong past renewals in  which resulted in an offsetting one percentage point increase in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues in when compared to  despite the increased investment in this team 
we plan to continue to optimize the utilization of existing professional services resources  while addressing incremental customer opportunities that may arise with the help of partners and other sub contractors  until an investment in additional full time resources is justifiable 
this may have an adverse impact on the gross profit for services and maintenance  as the gross profit realized by using partners and sub contractors is generally lower 
the mix and volume of services and maintenance revenues may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction  which will also affect our gross margins and results of operations

as planned we added additional sales coverage  which should allow us to better execute on the opportunities we are seeing in both in the united states and abroad 
we will continue to focus on our channels  with a view to providing the executive team time to focus on strategically growing the business 
however  we believe it is necessary for us to continue to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  services and marketing programs by maintaining our strategy of a investing in hiring and training our sales force in anticipation of future market growth  and b investing in marketing efforts in support of new product launches 
we believe it is necessary to invest in marketing programs that will improve the awareness and understanding of information security governance  and we will continue to invest in marketing toward that goal 
failure to make such investments could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
while we are focused on marketing programs and revenue generating opportunities to increase software revenues  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will be successful

year over year change year ended december  millions to to staff related costs outside professional services facilities related costs total the increase in research and development expenses for when compared to was primarily due to higher staff related costs and increased spending on outside professional contractors  as a result of the business signatures acquisition 
also  the unfavorable shift in the exchange rates between canada and the us  resulted in increased costs of million for when compared to  since the majority of these research and development expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
in addition  staff related costs were higher due to the recognition of stock option expenses in these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation costs associated with our ottawa facility 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for  compared to  reflects the higher expenses in  which resulted in a three percentage point increase in this effect was magnified by a one percentage point increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues due to lower total revenues for when compared to the decrease in research and development expenses for  compared to  was due mainly to continued management discipline in this area  with reduced spending for of approximately million  offset by the unfavorable shift in the exchange rate between canada and the us for the period that increased reported expenses by million

this effect was magnified by a one percentage point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues due to lower total revenues in when compared to the decline in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for compared to was due to the effect of continued management discipline in this area  with net savings of million  despite increased expenses of million from related to the inclusion of a full year of entrust japan expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased in compared to this is due to the net reduction in spending and improved revenue achievement during the net reduction in spending resulted in a one percentage point decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from to  while the increase in total revenues resulted in an additional decrease of one percentage point  as these expenses include a high degree of fixed costs 
we continue to explore opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in our administrative processes and to contain expenses in these functional areas

the current sublease was scheduled to end in december although we had been monitoring the sublet market on an on going basis  we had received an extension offer and had begun preparations for placing the facility on the market 
these events caused us to revisit our estimated sublease recoveries at that time 
we concluded that we needed to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to our june restructuring plan by a further million in the first quarter of fiscal to reflect a change in our projected sublet lease recoveries as evidenced by the market for leased facilities in that region 
subsequently  in the second quarter of  we made a further adjustment to decrease the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to the june restructuring plan with respect to our santa clara  california facility by thousand  to reflect the fact that the building sublease was extended with the current subtenant to march  and the corresponding expected sublet lease recoveries 
these adjustments were charged to the restructuring charges line in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
write down of long term strategic and equity investments we recorded non cash charges in the first quarter of related to the impairment of long term investments in asia digital media and ohana of million and thousand  respectively  as it was concluded that these investments had suffered an other than temporary decline in fair value 
interest income interest income was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in investment income for compared to was due to the funds invested in the acquisition of orion  business signatures and other long term assets  despite improved interest rates on invested funds compared to prior years 
the increase in investment income from to reflected improved interest rates on funds invested  despite the reduced balance of funds invested as a result of amounts drawn down to fund cash flow from operations and stock repurchases and to acquire long lived assets during the period 
the funds invested decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  however  the rate of return on our marketable investments improved to approximately for compared to approximately for and for gain on sale of asset we recorded a gain on the sale of unused intellectual property assets during in the amount of thousand 
this type of sale is not expected to be a recurring event 
loss from equity investments we recorded thousand  thousand and thousand of losses  net of intercompany profit eliminations  related to our investments in asia digital media in  and  respectively 
we began accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of  since we had 
table of contents the potential to significantly influence its operations and management 
in addition  we recorded thousand of losses related to our investment in ohana in  prior to the ohana restructuring 
we recorded thousand of losses related to our investment in entrust japan for these losses represented our share of the operating losses of entrust japan on an equity accounting basis 
our investment in entrust japan was accounted for under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock until the acquisition on september  when we increased our investment from to of the outstanding voting stock in entrust japan 
since september   we have consolidated the financial results of entrust japan in our financial statements 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of thousand in  compared to thousand in and thousand in these provisions represent primarily the taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rates differed from statutory rates primarily due to the impairment of long term strategic investments  stock option expenses  purchased product rights  foreign research and development tax credits  as well as an adjustment of the valuation allowance that has offset the tax benefits from the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available 
quarterly results of operations our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  our period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the completion date of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of our products often requires a significant capital investment  which customers may view as a discretionary cost and  therefore  a purchase that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  therefore  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues are heavily dependent upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we have generally recorded a significant portion of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we expect these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly license revenues are dependent on the timing of revenue recognition  which can be affected by many factors  including the timing of customer installations and acceptance 
in these regards  we have from time to time experienced delays in recognizing revenues with respect to certain orders 
in any period a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
despite the uncertainties in our revenue patterns  our operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout the quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are delayed or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected in a significant way 
the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
these data have been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
as a result of the adjustment to our restructuring accrual related to our california facility and the impairment of our investment in asia digital media and ohana recorded in the first quarter of  our operating expenses and net loss were higher in that quarter than in the subsequent quarters of the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generated million of cash in operating activities during this cash inflow was primarily a result of a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other receivables of million  partially offset by cash outflows resulting from a net loss after adjusting for non cash charges of million  and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges of million 
our average days sales outstanding at december  was days  which represents an improvement from the days that we reported at december  the overall decrease in days sales outstanding from december  was mainly due to improved in quarter collections due to improved sales linearity compared to the fourth quarter of  combined with an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts from the previous year 
for purposes of calculating average days sales outstanding  we divide ending accounts receivable by the applicable quarter s revenues and multiply this amount by days 
the level of accounts receivable at each quarter end is affected by the concentration of revenues in the final weeks of each quarter and may be negatively affected by expanded international revenues in relation to total revenues as licenses to international customers often have longer payment terms 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and the length of customer s payment cycle 
generally  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers  so that an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our days sales outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
we have observed an increase in the length of our customers payment cycles  which may result in higher accounts receivable balances  and could expose us to greater general credit risks with our customers and increased bad debt expense 
during  we used million of our cash related to investing activities 
cash provided by net reductions in our marketable investments in the amount of million was offset by the investment of million in the acquisition of orion  million in the acquisition of business signatures  million in property and equipment  primarily for computer hardware upgrades throughout our organization and million in other long term assets related to capitalized software and training video development costs 
we used cash of million in financing activities during primarily for the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of million and million to repay long term liabilities  offset by million of cash provided by the issuance of common stock  of which million related to the exercise of employee stock options 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in the amount of million provided our principal sources of liquidity 
overall  we used million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments during although we continue to target operating profitability  based on sustainable revenue and operating expense structures  we estimate that we may continue to use cash in fiscal to satisfy the obligations provided for under our restructuring program 
however  if operating losses continue to occur  then cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be negatively affected 
on july   we announced that our board of directors had authorized us to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the program has subsequently been extended three times  most recently on july  when the board of directors authorized a further extension of this stock repurchase program to permit the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock through december  this quantity of common shares was in addition to the  shares of our common stock already purchased under the stock repurchase program through june  as a result of this program s expiration on december  without extension  it is not expected that this program will have any implications for our cash flow for the foreseeable future 

table of contents during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cash outlay of million at an average price of  including commissions paid to brokers 
as of december   we had repurchased  of the authorized  shares of our common stock under this program  for a total cash outlay of million  at an average price of per share  including commissions paid to brokers 
while there can be no assurance as to the extent of usage of liquid resources in future periods  we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
in terms of long term liquidity requirements  we will need to fund the million of accrued restructuring charges at december  through fiscal  as detailed below 
this amount is net of expected sublet recoveries on restructured facilities of million 
the lease obligations included in these accrued restructuring charges are disclosed in the table of contractual commitments below 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million per year on capital expenditures  primarily for computer equipment needed to replace existing equipment that is coming to the end of its useful life  a significant portion of which are expected to be procured under operating leases 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  as well as future operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund these long term requirements 
we have commitments that will expire at various times through we lease administrative and sales offices and certain property and equipment under non cancelable operating leases that will expire at various dates to a summary of our contractual commitments at december  is as follows as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations currently utilized facilities operating lease obligations restructured facilities guaranteed payments to amikanow entrust deferred incentive and retention bonus plan other commitments total in addition to the lease commitments included above  we have provided letters of credit totaling million as security deposits in connection with certain office leases 
the entrust deferred incentive and retention bonus plan the deferred plan was adopted by the compensation committee of the board of directors on november  the primary objective of the deferred plan is to attract and retain valued employees by remunerating selected executives and other key employees with cash awards based on the contribution of the individual employee 
during the first quarter of  we granted awards to employees under the plan that potentially could result in payments of million over the subsequent two years  assuming that all employees receiving the awards remain employed with us for the entire two year vesting period of the awards 
of this amount  it was estimated that  as of december   thousand was remaining to be paid out under this plan 
other commitments include financing arrangements entered into for the purpose of funding annual insurance premiums  with a remaining balance at december  of thousand  to be paid during fiscal 
table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we enter into standard indemnification agreements with our business partners and customers 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to modify  repair or replace the product  pay royalties for a right to use  defend and reimburse the indemnified party for actual damages awarded by a court against the indemnified party for an intellectual property infringement claim by a third party with respect to our products and services  and indemnify for property damage that may be caused in connection with consulting services performed at a customer site by our employees or our subcontractors 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have general and umbrella insurance policies that generally enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we generally warrant for ninety days from delivery to a customer that our software products will perform free from material errors that prevent performance in accordance with user documentation 
additionally  we warrant that our consulting services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards including other warranties 
we have only incurred nominal expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of our obligations under these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we have entered into employment and executive retention agreements with certain employees and executive officers  which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions 
we have also entered into agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of not being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin no 
seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
the provisions of fin no 
will be effective for us as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we expect that the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements and expands disclosures about such measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather it creates a consistent method for calculating fair value measurements to address non comparability of financial statements containing fair value measurements utilizing different definitions of fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 to reduce earnings volatility caused by related assets and liabilities measured differently under gaap 
sfas no 
allows all entities to make an irrevocable instrument by instrument election to measure eligible items at fair value in their entirety 
in addition  
table of contents unrealized gains and losses will be reported in earnings at each reporting date 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements that focus on providing information about the impact of electing the fair value option 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november   concurrent with the adoption of sfas no 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk associated with interest rates our investment policy states that we will invest our cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  in investments that are designed to preserve principal  maintain liquidity and maximize return 
we actively manage our investments in accordance with these objectives 
some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk  whereby a change in market interest rates will cause the principal amount of the underlying investment to fluctuate 
therefore  depreciation in principal value of an investment is possible in situations where the investment is made at a fixed interest rate and the market interest rate then subsequently increases 
the following table presents the cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments that we held at december  and  that would have been subject to interest rate risk  and the related ranges of maturities as of those dates december  december  maturity maturity within months months months months within months months months months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents investments classified as short term marketable investments total amortized cost fair value we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers 
as a result  we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of these instruments were determined by net present values 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be less than thousand 
risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  specifically between the united states and canada  the united kingdom  the european union and japan 
this exposure is not considered to be material with respect to the united kingdom  european and japanese operations due to the fact that these operations are not significant 
however  because a disproportionate amount of our expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  through our canadian operations  while our canadian denominated revenue streams are cyclical  we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the canadian dollar  and in particular  fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar 
therefore  a favorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in higher revenues when translated into us dollars  but would also mean expenses would be higher in a corresponding fashion and to a greater degree 
historically  we have not engaged in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this foreign exchange risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses is minimized 
however  
table of contents as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  our expense base increased by million in  when compared to  due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states and canadian dollars 
taking into account the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on reported canadian revenues  the net effect on earnings was million for  when compared to in the past  when advantageous  we have engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  to cover exposures on canadian subsidiary s expenses that are denominated in canadian dollars  in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility that might result from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollar 
we did not engage in any forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars during the fourth quarter of  and no previously purchased foreign exchange contracts had extended past september  we currently have not engaged in any forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars to cover exposures on expenses denominated in canadian dollars in the first quarter of or future periods 
risk associated with long term strategic investments we invested in several privately held companies in and for business and strategic alliance purposes  most of which are technology companies in the start up or development stage  or are companies with technologies and products that are targeted at geographically distant markets 
as a result of other than temporary declines in the net realizable value  these investments were fully impaired over the period from to accordingly  there is no net book value remaining for these strategic investments as of december  as a result of the rescission agreement discussed elsewhere in this annual report  as of december   we held an investment in ohana  in the amount of thousand  representing approximately of the issued common shares of ohana 
this investment is now accounted for under the cost method 
ohana is in the start up or development stage  and may lack the financial resources  licenses  technology and governmental approvals necessary to import  develop or offer for sale any commercial product or service 
if the demand for ohana s products and services materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant market  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment 
we have recorded cumulative losses from our investment in ohana of thousand since the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  we were informed of an ohana re financing  which coupled with the changes in the business outlook  led us to conclude that the expectations for ohana had not materialized and an impairment charge was required to adjust the net carrying value of our equity ownership 
as a result  we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal an impairment of our investment in ohana of thousand 
after this impairment  the remaining carrying value of our investment in ohana at december  was thousand 
risk associated with equity investments in total we have invested million in asia digital media  representing an equity interest of approximately in the issued common shares of asia digital media at december  asia digital media is a joint venture in the start up or development stage  and may lack the financial resources  licenses  technology and governmental approvals necessary to import  develop or offer for sale in china any commercial product or service 
asia digital media has built  integrated  tested  and demonstrated the end to end solution within a lab environment and has put its first real subscribers into a live network as part of alpha trials 
asia digital media is currently working directly with cable operators and end users to refine its products for the market 
if no such offerings are developed due to insufficient financial resources  inability to license required third party intellectual property  technical problems  or a lack of necessary governmental approvals  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment 
in addition  if the demand for asia digital media s products and services materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant market  we could lose all or substantially all of our investment 

table of contents we have recorded cumulative losses from our investment in asia digital media of million since the investment in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  we were informed of changes in our chinese partner s ability to invest in the second funding round of asia digital media 
this factor  among others  had significant negative implications for asia digital media 
we concluded that expectations for asia digital media had not materialized and an impairment charge was required to adjust the net carrying value of our equity ownership 
as a result  we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal an impairment of our investment in asia digital media in the amount of million 
after this impairment  the remaining carrying value of our investment in asia digital media at december  was thousand
