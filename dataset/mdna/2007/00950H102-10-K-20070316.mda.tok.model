item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
see item a 
risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
overview since we have evolved from being the supplier of one line of broadband wireless access bwa equipment that utilized our proprietary technology to a supplier of a highly diversified suite of bwa equipment  including certain equipment that has been developed to conform with wimax and the wifi standards 
the diversification of our product portfolio has been the product of both internal research and development and targeted acquisitions 
see item business business overview 
as a result of the migration of telecommunications to platforms that operate using the internet protocol  we expect that our bwa equipment designed to handle communications over the internet will become increasingly important to us 
due to the projected popularity of technologies such as wimax and wifi  we also anticipate that our as 
max and as 
net products will become increasingly important to us 
see item business migration of telecommunications to ip platforms  the global need for broadband access and industry overview general 
our as 
max and as 
net products are designed to be inter operable with any other equipment that is wimax or wifi certified  respectively 
accordingly  we believe these relatively new products will face certain opportunities and risks that our proprietary products did not encounter 
see item business the global need for broadband access  item a 
risk factors our industry is subject to change as a result of emerging new technologies and industry standards and we operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the market for bwa equipment has been characterized by rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards 
our future success will therefore depend on our ability to adapt to these new standards and to successfully introduce new technologies that meet customer preferences 
we anticipate that we will need to continue to devote considerable resources to research and development to maintain and or improve upon our competitive position 
see item a 
risk factors our industry is subject to change as a result of emerging new technologies and industry standards and we operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
since july   we have acquired three suppliers of bwa equipment 
we intend to continue our strategy of expanding our business through  among other things  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies and joint ventures 
accordingly  we anticipate our future results of operation and financial condition may be directly or indirectly materially affected by our acquisition and joint venture effort 
acquisitions are inherently risky and our future growth may depend on our ability to successfully acquire  operate and integrate new businesses into our company 
see item business business overview and item a 
risk factors we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions 
our revenue has increased from million in and million in to million in we have incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
since becoming an independent company  we have generated significant net losses and negative cash flow 
we expect our cash flow to be negative in  but we also expect that our net losses will decline relative to we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we generate revenue from sales of our systems and from services related to implementation and support activities 
revenue from services in continued to be under of our total revenue 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
customer service contracts are generally of a short to medium term in nature  mostly for days and weeks  with a small number extending beyond a year 
with larger customers  we may agree in specific contracts to provide technical support and repair and maintenance services for longer periods  such as in the case of the agreement with yozan  where we have agreed to provide such services for a period of eight years 
otherwise  service contracts are typically sold separately from sales of our systems and typically provide services other than what is included in the basic warranty 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through distribution channels 
we also sell through independent agents and resellers in markets where we do not have a direct sales presence and to oems  who may sell our products under their name 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable and typically varies from one month to two years  often involving extensive testing and evaluation by prospective customers  which makes it difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to derive a substantial percentage of our revenue from fewer than ten customers 
in the years ended december  and december   axtel represented approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
in the years ended december  and december   yozan represented approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
we anticipate that our dependence on our ten largest customers will continue in  primarily due to our projected sales of asmax and proximity solutions to axtel  although we expect sales to axtel to continue to decline as a percentage of revenues 
see item a 
risk factors we currently depend on a few key customers our non us sales accounted for  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
the following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by customer geographic region in the periods identified 
percentage of revenue years ended december  geographic area united states asia pacific europe africa and middle east south and central america and the caribbean total while we expect that sales to axtel will still comprise a large percentage of our revenues for  we anticipate that the percentage of our sales to axtel and yozan will continue to decrease in and it is not expected that either one will exceed 
it is expected that our sales to europe and the asia pacific region will continue to increase 
for further information on our business and geographic segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties  overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs 
our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix both because our gross margin on base stations and related equipment is higher than the gross margin on subscriber terminals  and because our different product lines generate different margins 
in addition  our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems  volume discounts granted to significant customers and the proportion of total revenue from the sale of software  which typically carries a higher gross margin than hardware 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in an effort to maintain or increase our gross margins 
further  we expect to derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels 
revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design  development  testing facilities and equipment depreciation 
these expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts  including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production as well as sub contracted development work 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  consulting and agent s fees and expenses for advertising  travel  technical assistance  trade shows  and promotional and demonstration materials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities including costs associated with the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our personnel  audit  professional and consulting fees and facilities costs 
to date inflation has not had a material impact on the company s business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the effectiveness of our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty reserve  restructuring costs  purchase accounting  valuation of goodwill and other intangibles  income taxes  derivative instruments  and legal proceedings 
with the adoption of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r in the first quarter of  equity compensation involved critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are dependant on significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our material revenue streams are the result of a range of activities 
management must use significant judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations 
our revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of products sold and services provided as well as the customers involved 
our revenue recognition policy reflects the fact that our revenue streams are primarily derived from i sales of hardware and software that do not require significant customization  and ii services rendered eg extended warranty  product maintenance  radio planning  consulting services  etc 
in any one arrangement  we sometimes generate revenue from more than one of these revenue streams 
in those instances  there is an added level of complexity in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition see revenue arrangements that include multiple elements below 
management must apply significant judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations related to revenue recognition 
subject to the more specific revenue recognition policies discussed below  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price for the product or service is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for new products  if we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amount of warranty obligations  we recognize revenue on sales of such products that otherwise meet the criteria for revenue recognition 
for the new wimax products introduced in and  we believe we have the ability to reasonably and reliably estimate the amount of warranty obligations and we have therefore recognized revenue on sales of such products 
the following are our specific revenue recognition policies delivery of hardware delivery of hardware is considered to have occurred upon shipment  provided that risk of loss  and title in certain jurisdictions  have been transferred to the customer 
for arrangements where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met because legal title or risk of loss on products did not transfer to the buyer until final payment had been received or where delivery had not occurred  revenue is deferred to a later period when title or risk of loss passes either on delivery or on receipt of payment from the customer 
assessment of creditworthiness we are required to assess the creditworthiness of our customers 
we use judgment in assessing their creditworthiness  and the criteria by which each judgment is made may change in future periods and may therefore change future revenue recognition 
the collectibility of receivables is critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized 
we will defer revenue if we are uncertain as to whether we will be able to collect the receivable 
as a result  our judgment regarding customer credit quality could significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
extended payment terms we provide extended payment terms to certain customers 
for these customers  the agreement is considered to have a price that is fixed or determinable if the company has the intent and ability to fully collect from the customer under these terms without making additional concessions 
we assess our ability to collect without further concessions by considering the company s history of successfully collecting from the customer under the original payment terms 
alternatively  or in addition  we consider the current and expected creditworthiness of the customer and the payment terms in relation to the expected useful and technological life of the product 
if it is expected  at the outset of the arrangement  that concessions will be required in the future in order to collect  the agreement is not considered to have a price that is fixed or determinable 
in such cases  revenue for delivered products is generally deferred until the fees become legally due and payable 
in certain cases where there have previously been collection issues  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
therefore  estimates and judgment in this area can impact the timing of revenue recognition 
product revenue revenue from product sales  including sales to distributors and resellers  is generally recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is required  rights of return exist  collection of the receivable becomes less than assured or other significant obligations remain that are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue is then recognized when these conditions have been satisfied 
the estimated cost of any post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  is accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on a number of factors  which include historical experience and known conditions that may impact future warranty costs 
revenue from sales to resellers and distributors is generally recognized only when the resellers are creditworthy in their own right or have an identified creditworthy end customers for our products and services 
service revenue revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized once the services have been performed 
revenue from service contracts pursuant to which we provide services over a period of time is recognized ratably over the given contract period 
revenue is recognized on fixed price service contracts when the services have been completed 
revenue arrangements that include multiple elements in certain cases  we enter into agreements with customers whereby we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or multiple services multiple elements 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
revenue for these transactions is recognized on each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element 
revenue is recognized for delivered products and services only if i the above product revenue or service revenue criteria are met  ii undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services  and iv the fair value for each of the undelivered elements is known 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in the contract  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting or element based on relative fair values 
in situations where there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements  but not for delivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate the contract consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
if fair value does not exist for any undelivered element  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of the time that i the undelivered element is delivered or ii fair value of the undelivered element exists  unless the undelivered element is a service  in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element 
our determination of whether deliverables within a multiple element arrangement can be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes involves significant estimates and judgment  such as whether fair value can be established on undelivered obligations and or whether delivered elements have standalone value to the customer 
changes to our assessment of the accounting units in an arrangement and or our ability to establish fair values could significantly change the timing of revenue recognition 
our assessment of which revenue recognition guidance is appropriate to account for a deliverable also can involve significant judgment 
contract accounting when the company performs a specific development type contract for a customer subject to contract accounting under sop  we may adopt the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method to recognize revenues under the contract 
alternatively  where contracts under which separate units of output are produced  where progress can be measured on the basis of units of work completed  output is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established and the agreement contains milestones at which nonrefundable payments will be made by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable balances 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  the current creditworthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods to reflect our current judgment  and changes may occur in the future due to the market environment 
should we consider it necessary to increase the level of reserves required for a particular customer or customers  then additional charges will be recorded in the future 
inventory reserves we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
as a result  we exercise judgment as to the level of provisions required for excess and obsolete inventory 
these judgments are based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
during recent periods we have made provisions against inventory reflecting the decline in our expectations of the demand for certain of our products 
should we decide in the future that actual market conditions have become less favorable  or should our assumptions change due to market conditions  additional inventory provisions may be required 
warranty reserves typically our products are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
in a limited number of cases  warranties extend beyond two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs required to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions  as well as back to back warranty coverage that we have with our contract manufacturers 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs or our assessment of future conditions change  our warranty accrual will increase  which will result in decreased gross profit 
restructuring costs during  and we recorded restructuring charges arising from our cost reduction programs and established reserves which include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  the loss on subletting excess facilities  and the write down of assets to be disposed of as part of the restructuring 
when providing for restructuring charges we make estimates as to the expected costs to be incurred 
estimates of future income from sub letting excess facilities are made that offset expected future costs 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from the amount of the reserves 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities require a high degree of judgment involving assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
in certain situations  where we deem necessary  we may use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
we used the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions  for which adjustments are made to the initial purchase price allocation for up to a year from the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation for the arelnet acquisition was finalized in  and amounts recorded for the radionet acquisition were finalized in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment review and the review of long lived assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of the result of these reviews determined that no impairment of goodwill or other intangible or long lived assets needed to be recorded during the year ended december  in these reviews  we may make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge that would adversely affect our results 
income taxes research and development tax credits during  and  we recorded tax credits relating to research and development expenditures in the united kingdom for the amount we expect to realize 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the inland revenue has the right to audit claims made for research and development tax credits and  until the authorities have approved the claims  there is potential uncertainty as to whether the final claim will be accepted 
it is therefore possible that we may ultimately realize more or less than the amount of credit that has been accrued in the financial statements at december  deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
as at december   we recorded a valuation allowance  effectively writing down our deferred tax assets to zero 
we consider our future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to determine whether our valuation allowance is appropriate 
the main factors we consider are our cumulative losses in recent years  our net loss for the current period and our future earnings potential determined through the use of internal forecasts 
other taxes we are subject to local taxes in each country that we have a permanent establishment or other taxable presence 
we make estimates of our potential liability to tax in these jurisdictions  which estimates are subject to examination by the local tax authorities 
derivative instruments we are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of certain currencies to the us dollar  particularly us pounds sterling and new israeli shekels 
from time to time  we have entered into forward exchange contracts as a cash flow hedge of a portion of our pounds sterling operating expenses  primarily salary and facility lease expenses 
we make assumptions with respect to the amount and timing of entering into these contracts and the number of periods that we hedge  and we consider the value of our foreign currency obligations and the forecasted exchange rate 
should the spot rate at the maturity of the contract be more favorable than the forward rate  we would incur an economic loss on that particular contract since we would pay more for the foreign currency than we would have without the contract 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
legal proceedings we are subject to class action complaints related to alleged false and misleading information in the registration statement and prospectus used in july  see item legal proceedings  and we may also face litigation for labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to changes in circumstances within each case 
new accounting pronouncements prior to january   we accounted for awards issued under these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
in all periods shown prior to january   we valued stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 and requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we adopted sfas r as of january   using the modified prospective transition method 
our consolidated financial statements for reflect the impact of sfas r 
the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
the adoption of this statement has resulted in higher reported operating expenses for and will result in higher reported operating expenses in our future financial statements 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for was million 
the following table summarizes share based compensation expense under sfas r for the year ended december  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expense cost of sales total stock based compensation in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for us in the first quarter of the company has assessed the impact of the adoption of fin  and it does not expect that fin will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statement sab no 

sab provides guidance on the consideration of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the staff of the sec the staff believes registrants must quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on a company s current year consolidated financial statements 
the staff prescribes two approaches to assessing the materiality of misstatements the rollover approach  which quantifies misstatements based on the amount of error originating in the current year income statement and the iron curtain approach  which quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the cumulative effect existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year 
if under either approach  misstatements are deemed material  a company is required to adjust its financial statements  including correcting prior year financial statements  even if such correction was  and continues to be  immaterial to the prior year financial statements 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require a company to amend previously filed reports  and such corrections may be made the next time the company files its prior year statements 
the adoption of sab in did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value of certain assets and liabilities  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but may change current practice for certain entities 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table provides operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing bad debt general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring provision total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net income taxes net loss deemed dividend associated with beneficial conversion of preferred stock net loss attributable common stockholders restructuring we have initiated six restructuring programs over the last five years to reduce our operating expenses 
the first of these was initiated in the third quarter of a charge of million was recorded in the quarter 
included in this charge were costs related to the write off of tradeshow equipment and severance payments 
a total of employees were terminated as part of this program and all severance payments were made by the end of the second quarter of in the second quarter of  an additional restructuring program was initiated to further lower operating expenses 
the cost incurred as part of this program was million arising from costs associated with facility closures and severance 
a total of employees were terminated as part of this program and all severance payments were made by december  during the first quarter of we revised our original restructuring programs and initiated a new program to further reduce operating expenses 
this program was completed by the end of the third quarter of the total cost incurred for this restructuring program was million related to termination costs for employees 
all of these employees had left the company by december  in conjunction with the purchase of the proximity business in the company implemented its plan to relocate the proximity business from maidenhead  england and sunrise  florida to the company s facilities in uxbridge  england and boca raton  florida  respectively 
the company recorded acquisition related restructuring charges of million  in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the relocation of the proximity business 
the accrued relocation costs were reduced during to million 
the adjustment formed part of the revised fair value adjustments of the proximity acquisition 
this relocation plan was completed by december  in the fourth quarter of the decision was made to completely outsource all of our manufacturing 
as a result  the company recorded a million restructuring charge for the closure of its riverside  uxbridge facility in all of this cost relates to the excess facility 
a further million was recognized as restructuring in the income statement in the fourth quarter of as the company reassessed the ability to sublease the riverside facility 
during the second quarter of  the company recognized an additional restructuring charge of million for additional costs expected to be incurred related to certain facility charges in respect of buildings in the uk the total amount expected to be incurred as a result of the closure of the riverside facility is up to million  of which million remains accrued as at december  included in this accrual is the estimated cost to repair dilapidations at our riverside facility 
the final cost of these dilapidations will depend on the lessor s intended use for this facility 
currently  the lessor expects us to refurbish the facility  and accordingly we have accrued the total estimated cost of this refurbishment 
however  if the lessor should subsequently decide to demolish the building and completely rebuild on this site  our costs will be materially lower 
all cash outflows in connection with this restructuring are expected to occur by the end of in the third quarter of  the company commenced a company wide restructuring program to reduce operating expenses 
in  the company recorded restructuring charges of million  to reflect the total cost of this restructuring program 
the cost reduction will be accomplished primarily as a result of reductions in worldwide headcount 
the restructuring resulted in direct cash outlays in the third and fourth quarters of  and the company expects to incur million of cash outlays in the first quarter of related to amounts accrued in once the program is completed  the company projects it will be able to realize annual cost savings of approximately million relative to the cost structure that existed at the end of the second quarter of despite the company s efforts to prepare reliable projections  it recognizes that forecasts may prove to be imprecise due to unforeseen events  including unanticipated expenses or difficulties associated with reducing its workforce  requiring retained staff members to assume additional responsibilities and or reorganizing its operations to more cost efficiently produce a given level of product revenue 
the restructuring charges and their utilization are summarized as follows balance at accrued balance at beginning restructuring on end all amounts in thousands of us s of period charge acquisition utilized of period year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the first full year of sales of our wimax and as 
net products  which accounted for approximately of revenues 
in we made deliveries of wimax systems to more than customers in more than countries  and the continued growth in sales of our wipll products  which comprised approximately of revenues in growth in revenues from wimax  wipll and as 
net products more than offset significant declines in sales of proximity and asx products 
the growth in was attributable to a number of important contracts signed or fulfilled in they included deliveries of wimax products to yozan in japan  deutsche breitband dienste in germany  pipex wireless in the united kingdom  metromax in samara  russia  and sogetel in canada 
tulip it continued to deploy its wipll network in india 
other customers like last mile broadband in ireland purchased both wipll and wimax products for their networks 
in we were less reliant on axtel  as expected  and our proximity product line as our major source of revenues 
axtel comprised approximately of revenues  down substantially from in while we project that a significant amount of our revenues in will come from a limited number of customers  we do not currently expect any one customer to account for more than of the total in see item a 
risk factors we currently depend on a few key customers geographically  in  approximately of our revenue was derived from customers in asia  from customers in mexico  latin america and the caribbean  and from customers in europe 
customers in the united states and canada  and africa and the middle east accounted for approximately and of revenues  respectively 
cost of revenue and inventory provision cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue was in and in cost of revenue for fiscal included inventory provisions of million  of which million related to a net charge under the yozan contract 
this charge for yozan reflects our estimate of the probable amount of excess inventories and purchase commitments net of amounts that are cancellable  based on the expected deliveries to yozan under the amended supply contract 
cost of revenue in included inventory provisions of million  of which million represented a write off in the fourth quarter of in connection with inventory shortages that were identified in the physical inventory count at our israeli subsidiary 
gross margin was for the fiscal year versus in during  the gross margins from the increased sales of higher margin wipll  wimax and as 
net products were adversely offset by the yozan inventory provision described above 
gross margins were also adversely affected in by increased freight and warranty expenses  which grew as a result of the change in mix of products sold 
a decline in sales of proximity  most of which is delivered at the production site to customers  and which has very low warranty costs given the maturity and stability of the platform  was offset by increased sales of wipll and wimax products  which were shipped in from the united kingdom and israel to all parts of the world 
we also incurred higher warranty expenses on the new wimax product line  because the product has not yet achieved the stability of other more mature products we sell 
we do expect to see an improvement  however  in warranty costs with the proposed move by the end of the second half of of wimax manufacturing from the united kingdom to mexico  where we expect to receive more favorable back to back warranty terms from our contract manufacturer  as well as a reduction from the product becoming more mature 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the additional research and development expenses we incurred in connection with the introduction of our new wimax products  and to costs incurred by arelnet and radionet  which were acquired in june and november  respectively 
in  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs related to our wimax development  particularly as we introduce new wimax products that meet the e wimax mobility standard 
we expect to offset some of the increase by reducing or eliminating development spending on our non wimax product lines 
we expect research and development administrative expenses to decrease slightly in sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is related to product marketing  commissions  trade shows and travel  largely attributable to introduction of our new wimax products 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in bad debt expense during and  we wrote down receivables by million and million  respectively 
the increase in write downs in were due primarily to our concerns with our ability to collect payments from certain customers in south and central america 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of additional payroll costs arising from our acquisitions of arelnet and radionet  and to additional fees incurred in connection with our audit and compliance with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain at approximately the same level in amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase resulted from the full year charge for the amortization of intangibles acquired from arelnet and radionet in restructuring provision during the second quarter of  the company recorded an additional restructuring charge of million for costs related to certain facility charges in respect of buildings in the uk in the third quarter of  the company commenced a company wide restructuring program to reduce operating expenses 
as a result  in the company recorded restructuring charges of million  to reflect the total cost of this restructuring program

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  and we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  in  million related to investments with a purchase to maturity date between days and days 
in addition  we have included in short term investments auction rate securities for a total of million 
auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are reset through a dutch auction process which occurs every days 
the holder can participate in the auction and liquidate the auction rate securities to prospective buyers through their broker dealer 
substantially all of the remaining amounts as of both december  and december   consisted of highly liquid investments with purchase to maturity terms of less than days 
these investments are exposed to interest rate risk  but a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by two percentage points from december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a short term increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time would  however  reduce our net interest income 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken to mitigate this  and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis does not take into account any such action 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the following table shows our revenue by currency as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  us dollars euros australian dollars other total euro denominated sales for the periods presented were all figures in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  euros average exchange rate of us us equivalent if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower by they would have decreased or increased the total euro denominated sale value by total australian dollar denominated sales for the periods presented were all figures in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  australian dollars aus aus aus average exchange rate of us australian dollar us equivalent if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower by they would have decreased or increased the total euro denominated sale value by we expect the proportions of sales in euro and australian dollars to fluctuate over time 
the company s sensitivity analysis for changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in changes in sales volumes 
the company s operating results are affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  particularly the us pound sterling and new israeli shekel 
this is because most of our operating expenses  which may fluctuate over time  are incurred in pounds sterling and new israeli shekels 
to manage our pound foreign currency risk we have  at various times in through  forecast our likely net spending on operating expenses in non us dollars and  based on these forecasts  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cover a percentage of the projected exposure 
at december  we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
the aggregate amount of forward contracts of pounds sterling that matured during the year ended december  was million pounds sterling  and we paid operating expenses in local currency of approximately million pounds sterling over the same period 
the effectiveness of the contracts as hedges was approximately 
if during the average exchange rates had been higher or lower by  the pound sterling denominated operating expenses would have decreased or increased by million 
during the year ended december  we paid operating expenses in new israeli shekels of million new israeli shekels 
none of these expenses have been hedged 
if the average exchange rates had been higher or lower by  the new israeli shekel operating expenses would have decreased or increased by million for the year ended december for the years ended december  and we incurred the majority of our cost of revenue in us dollars 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
