in the commercial channel  net sales remained unchanged at million in compared to million last year 
during the year we made a decision to renegotiate terms and discounts with our commercial dealers in order to increase overall profitability within the channel

in the retail channel  net sales increased to million as compared to million last year 
growth in the channel is mainly due to an increase in sales volume through our existing retail partners which resulted in additional sales for our bowflex rod based home gyms  selecttech dumbbells  and launching the bowflex blaze home gym in the third quarter of contributing further to the growth was the realization of a full year of sales from products introduced later in for our schwinn fitness line of cardio equipment

during the year  we also revised our supply chain strategy to increase the number of shipments to our retail customers directly from our asian manufacturing partners 
while this contributed to a reduction in net sales during the year  our profitability increased due to decreased distribution  freight and the us customs related costs

royalties royalty expense decreased to million in as compared to million in our direct  commercial and retail channels have several agreements under which we are obligated to pay royalty fees on certain products 
the decrease in our royalty expense was primarily attributable to the april expiration of a royalty agreement related to the bowflex patents 
this decrease in bowflex related royalties was partially offset by royalty expense associated with our treadclimber and elliptical product sales 
we are obligated to pay royalties  at the rate of of treadclimber sales  to the inventor of the main patent on the treadclimber until this patent expires on december  consolidated income tax expense the provision for income tax expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to fluctuations in income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources our operating  investing  and financing activities resulted in cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  net cash generated by operating activities in was million compared to used in operating activities in the increase in operating cash flows is due to growth in net income  non cash share based expense of million resulting from the adoption of sfas r  and non cash foreign currency gain of million from transactions with our international subsidiaries 
further contributing to the increased operating cash flows is the decrease in inventories of million due to improved inventory management 
offsetting this increase in cash flows are increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and million  respectively 
the increase in trade receivables reflects the ongoing growth in sales channels that require longer payment terms 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to million in receipts for licensee revenues  million receivables for vendor discounts  million in receivables for manufacturer paid warranty costs  and an increase of million and million in prepaid advertising costs and prepaid inventories  respectively  in comparison to those in fiscal working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the investing and financing activities described below 
net cash used by investing activities was million in compared with million in in  we strengthened our brand portfolio by purchasing the universal brand for approximately million 
we also purchased the rodgers ip portfolio for million for which we had previously paid royalties  and made a million deposit for a potential acquisition of the assets of land america  our asian contract manufacturer 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in capital expenditures consisted of manufacturing equipment  website development costs to support our innovative product offerings  and computer equipment to maintain and expand current information systems for future growth 
in  we also collected million from the sales of our former headquarters building located in vancouver  washington and the distribution center located in tyler  texas 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was million in the increase is due to stock repurchases of million  additional million paid on long term debt assumed by us as the result of the belko canada acquisition in  lower net short term borrowings in comparison to  and lower proceeds from stock option exercises 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
the following table presents our estimated contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total net of imputed interest 
given that the majority of our inventory is sourced from asia  we have long lead times for inventory purchases and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
as the result  approximately million of the million in purchase obligations is for inventory purchases 
this inventory is predominately related to sales anticipated in the first half of off balance sheet arrangements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this form k  from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources with third parties to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our commercial products 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guarantee or other recourse provisions 
at december  and december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have an agreement with a financing company to provide second tier financing for our consumers 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting treatment for these arrangements and the related disclosures  respectively 
inflation and price changes although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  increases in inflation over historical levels or uncertainty in the general economy could decrease discretionary consumer spending for products like ours 
during both and  we experienced increases in transportation costs due to increases in the price for fuel 
as the result  we implemented a four percent price increase passing some of these cost increases to the end consumer 
to the extent these costs continue to increase and we are unable to pass these costs to the customer  our gross margins may continue to be negatively impacted 
seasonality in general  based on historic trends  we expect our sales from fitness equipment products both in the us and internationally to vary seasonally with sales typically the strongest in the fourth quarter  followed by the first and third quarters  and the weakest in the second quarter 
our analysis shows that such factors as the broadcast of 
table of contents national network season finales and seasonal weather patterns influence television viewership and cause our television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
in addition  during the spring and summer consumers tend to do more activities outside including exercise  which impacts sales of fitness equipment used indoors 
sales from our fitness apparel products are strongest in the first and third quarters and weakest during the fourth quarter 
we expect the fluctuation in our consolidated net sales between our highest and lowest quarters to be approximately 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the us gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of the company 
based on this definition  we believe the items listed below are our critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions  as well as critical accounting policies presented in note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this form k  and the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the disclosure about each estimate in the md a 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
product warranty we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the consumer 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  along with the historical and anticipated cost to repair  replace or refund the original sale 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
stock compensation we account for employee share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
the fair value of each equity award as well as determination of probability when performance targets for awards subject to performance conditions are expected to be met require extensive use of judgment 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different amounts of compensation cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record any such possible losses in accordance with us gaap 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments  and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision 
table of contents and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  may have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets valuation we evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on anticipated cash flows  market conditions  regulatory and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss may reduce our net worth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   goodwill and intangible assets represented of our total assets 
new accounting pronouncements for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold our cash and cash equivalents primarily in bank deposits and in liquid debt instruments with maturity dates of less than one year 
we are subject to concentration of credit risk as bank deposits may exceed federally insured limits 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from currency fluctuations  mainly in canada and europe  due to sourcing of our products in the us dollars and selling them primarily in canadian dollars  swiss francs  and euros 
given the relative size of our current foreign operations  the exposure to the exchange risk could have a material impact on the results of operations 
management estimates the maximum impact on stockholders equity of a ten percent change in any applicable foreign currency to be approximately million 
interest rate risk fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current variable rate credit agreements expose us to market risk 
as of december   our outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities were million and represented of our total liabilities 
due to the short term nature of these borrowings  management believes that any reasonably possible near term changes in related interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
