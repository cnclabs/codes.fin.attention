overview we are a growing independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore natural gas and oil reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on the exploration and development of coalbed methane cbm properties located in the rocky mountain region and on our waterflood oil recovery programs in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contribute drilling locations  pay tangible drilling costs and provide turnkey drilling services  natural gas marketing services and well services to the drilling programs and retain an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
for fiscal years and later  warren will not recognize revenue from turnkey drilling services 
as of december   we have performed our obligations under the turnkey drilling contracts 
as a result  we have no deferred income liability as of december  our future revenue growth is primarily dependent on our ability to increase our oil and gas reserves and production 
the schedule below reflects revenue and expense from natural gas and oil sales and from turnkey contracts for the years ended december  and oil and gas sales production and exploration expense depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment gross margin turnkey contract revenue with affiliated partnerships turnkey contract expense depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment gross margin liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased million during this resulted from cash used in investing activities of million 
this was offset by cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
cash used in investing activities of million results from million for expenditures on oil and gas properties and equipment offset by the release of million in us treasury bonds relating to the acquisition of certain drilling programs and the redemption of debentures 
cash provided by operating activities of million primarily relates to oil and gas operations 
cash provided by financing activities of million primarily results from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during the first quarter of  effective as of the last drilling partnership distribution date in the fourth quarter of and closing on march   the investor partners of the drilling partnerships voted to approve the sale of all of the oil and gas assets of the drilling partnerships to us 
the aggregate purchase price was million 
as a result  net of our interest  the company issued  shares of restricted common stock and paid million in cash in exchange for both producing and non producing properties 
the number of shares issued was determined based upon a discount from the weighted average sales price for warren s publicly traded common stock for the forty five calendar days ending march  the company recorded the transaction based on the undiscounted weighted average price of its common stock for the forty five calendar days ending march  the company received oil and gas properties having a pv value of approximately million as determined by williamson petroleum consultants  inc  as well as unproved properties 
additionally during the first quarter of  we purchased for cash the remaining minority oil and gas interests not already owned by warren from the drilling program llc s originally formed between and based upon their pv value as determined by williamson petroleum consultants  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
we paid an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
the remaining minority interest relating to these partnerships was recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the assets acquired 
on november   warren entered into a five year  million credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility up to the lesser of i the borrowing base ii million and iii the draw limit requested by the company 
the credit facility matures on november  it is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the borrowing base will be determined by the lenders at least semi annually on each april and october  beginning april  and is based in part on the proved reserves of the company 
interest payments are made quarterly in arrears 
the initial borrowing base is million 
the company is subject to certain covenants under the terms of the credit facility which include  but are not limited to the maintenance of the following financial ratios minimum current ratio of to and a maximum total net debt to annualized consolidated ebitdax as defined by the credit facility of to depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a the higher of i the agent s prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent  plus per annum  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  or b eurodollar loan rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
the company had net income of million after preferred dividends and accretion of million for  as compared to a net loss of million including preferred dividends of million for at december   current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately million 
we expect our cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operating activities and bank financings to be sufficient to fund our operations for more than the next twelve months 
at december   we had approximately million vested outstanding stock options issued under our stock based equity compensation plans 
of the total million outstanding vested options  only  options had exercise prices above the closing market price of our common stock on december  if the options with exercise prices below the closing market price on december  are exercised by the holders  we would receive million in cash 
capital expenditure program our capital expenditure budget for is million  which includes participation in the drilling of gross net wells 
at the present time  we are concentrating our drilling activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit wtu and the north wilimington unit nwu 
additionally  we have three exploratory projects in wyoming  the atlantic rim and pacific rim projects in the washakie basin and one in the hanna basin 
we are planning to drill gross net producing and injecting wells in california with capital expenditures estimated at million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the wtu with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to recomplete or drill gross net wells in the nwu with estimated capital expenditures of million 
also  we plan to drill gross net producing and injecting wells in wyoming with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the atlantic rim project with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the pacific rim project with estimated capital expenditures of million 
lastly  we are currently drilling one exploratory well in wyoming with estimated net capital expenditures of million 
the final determination regarding whether to drill the budgeted wells referred to above is dependent upon many factors including the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated energy prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
our estimated total proved reserves as of december  are approximately billion cubic feet of gas equivalent bcfe with a pv value of approximately million using december  oil and gas pricing 
approximately of our estimated net proved reserves are undeveloped 
compared with the development of our cbm properties  we anticipate that development of our oil properties in california could have a more immediate impact on our cash flows 
we also anticipate that we will be able to conduct drilling operations in california on a year round basis without weather induced or other drilling delays as may occur in the rocky mountain areas where our cbm properties are located 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility together with a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors 
stock based equity compensation plan information at december   we had approximately million vested outstanding stock options issued under our stock based equity compensation plans 
of the total million outstanding vested options  million had exercise prices below the closing market price of our common stock on december  if such options are exercised by the holders  we will receive the exercise price in cash 
the following table provides information with respect to shares of our common stock that may be issued under vested stock options whose exercise price was less than our closing stock price on december  number of securities to be issued upon proceeds to be received exercise price of exercise of vested upon exercise of vested outstanding vested options outstanding options outstanding options for additional detail about our stock based equity compensation plans  see executive compensation employee benefit plans under item and as incorporated by reference from our proxy statement on form a 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
below  we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this methodology  costs incurred to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed 
unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are periodically assessed for impairment of value and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance 
other unproved properties are amortized based on our experience of successful drilling  terms of leases and historical lease expirations 
capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties are depleted by the units of production method on a field by field basis 
lease costs are depleted using total proved reserves while lease equipment and intangible development costs are depleted using proved developed reserves 
our proved properties are evaluated on a field by field basis for impairment 
an impairment loss is recorded whenever net capitalized costs exceed expected future net cash flow based on engineering estimates 
in this circumstance  we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the properties exceeds the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flow 
on the sale or retirement of a complete unit of a proved property  the cost and related accumulated depletion and amortization are eliminated from the property accounts  and the resulting gain or loss is recognized 
on the retirement or sale of a partial unit of proved property  the cost is charged to accumulated depletion and amortization with a resulting gain or loss recognized in earnings 
on the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property  a gain or loss on the sale is recognized  taking into consideration the amount of any recorded impairment if the property had been assessed individually 
if a partial interest in an unproved property is sold  the amount received is treated as a reduction of the cost of the interest retained 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates depends in part on the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
revenue recognition affiliated partnerships enter into agreements with us to drill wells to completion for a fixed price 
we  in turn  enter into drilling contracts primarily with unrelated parties to drill wells on a day work basis 
therefore  if problems are encountered on a well  the cost of that well will increase and gross profit will decrease and could result in a loss on the well 
we recognize revenue from the turnkey drilling agreements on a proportional performance method as services are performed 
this involves management making judgments and estimates as to their various stage of completion of each well based on the review of drilling logs  status reports from engineers and historical experience in completing similar wells 
when estimates of future revenues and expenses on a specific contract indicate a loss will be incurred  the total estimated loss is accrued 
oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by us in various oil and gas properties 
sales of natural gas and oil produced are recognized when delivered to or picked up by the purchaser 
oil and gas sales from marketing activities result from sales by us of oil and gas produced by affiliated joint ventures and partnerships and are recognized when delivered to purchasers 
well services revenue is recognized when services are performed

no dividends may be paid on the common stock as long as there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 
commencing july  and thereafter  at the election of the holder of our convertible preferred stock  each share of preferred stock is convertible into share of common stock 
the conversion rate for our convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment in the event of the issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock  the combination  subdivision or reclassification of the common stock  or the distribution to all holders of common stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets  including securities issued by third parties  but excluding cash dividends or distributions paid out of surplus

at december   there were  preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to redeem during the year ended december   and thereafter  and  preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to be redeemed during the year ended december  and thereafter 
upon receipt of a redemption election  we  at our option  shall either pay the holder cash in an amount equal to per convertible preferred share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends or stock exchanges  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  to the extent that we have funds legally available for redemption  or issue to the holder shares of common stock in an amount equal to of the cash redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends  based on the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date of the receipt of the written redemption election by the holder  as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or by any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded 
in the event that we elect to pay the redemption price in kind with our common stock  for the  shares of preferred stock representing million of redemption price value  notwithstanding the market price of our common stock  we shall not issue to the redeeming preferred stockholders less than their proportionate share of  shares of our shares of common stock  nor be obligated to issue more than  shares of our common stock in full satisfaction of the redemption  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends and stock exchanges

in addition  the preferred stock  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  shall be converted into common stock at the then applicable conversion rate upon the vote or written consent of the holders of of the then outstanding preferred stock  voting together as a class 
accordingly  if the holders of any of the then remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock request redemption commencing in and thereafter and we elect to pay the redemption price for the preferred stock in cash  we would need capital of per share  plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends  which funds may not be available and the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial liquidity and results of operation 
alternatively  if we elect to pay the redemption price for the preferred stock commencing in and thereafter with shares of our common stock  such issuance could materially increase the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding and be dilutive to our earnings per share  if any

such us treasury bonds had a fair market value of million at december  the company has a contract with nabors well services co 
contractor for drilling wells in california that expires september  the contract provides for an operating rate of  per day 
in the event of early termination  a shortfall charge of  per day is incurred for each day prior to the initial termination date  which is limited to a maximum of  the company has a contract with ensign united states drilling  inc contractor for drilling wells in california that expires august  the contract provides for an operating rate of  per day 
in the event of early termination  the company will incur demobilization costs of  plus actual costs incurred by the contractor for removing and returning the rig to the contractor s yard  for a maximum of  in off balance sheet arrangements under the terms of our drilling programs formed from to  investors have the right to tender their interest back to the drilling program and other program investors during the period from seven to years after the date of the partnership s formation 
the tender rights were included to make such programs more attractive to potential investor partners  thereby enabling the company to obtain more capital to drill more oil and gas wells 
to the extent that an investor tenders a drilling program interest for sale and the drilling program and other investors elect not to repurchase the withdrawing partner s interest  we will be required to repurchase the interest from the investor 
the price of our repurchase is fixed by the drilling program agreement to be the lower of the pv value of the assets of the program and a formula based on the amount of the investor s cash investment reduced by the amount of any cash distributions received 
as of december   based on the december  reserve reports of the respective drilling programs  the aggregate pv value of the assets in these programs is million 
because this pv value is less than the formula price of million at december   the maximum repurchase price obligation at december  was million 
this pv value would be higher if current prices for crude oil and natural gas were to increase when we place the remaining net wells on production on behalf of these five drilling programs 
in the event of repurchase  we receive the investor s interest in the program  which includes the investor s beneficial share of the program s reserves and related future net cash flows 
there are no known events that would result in termination of the material benefits of our off balance sheet arrangements except for a decrease in oil and gas pricing that occurs after an acquisition 
the only material off balance sheet benefit of this arrangement is the acquisition of proved reserves 
to the extent that we acquire interests for their pv value based on this arrangement  and declining oil and natural gas prices  or other factors  render those interests less valuable  a material reduction in the benefit of this arrangement to the company would occur 
the table below presents the projected timing of our maximum potential repurchase commitment associated with these programs as of december  amount of repurchase commitment per period less than year years years more than years total in thousands maximum potential repurchase commitment based on the partnership reserves taken from the williamson partnership reserve report as of december  and using pricing at that date
