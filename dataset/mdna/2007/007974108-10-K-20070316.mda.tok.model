overview we offer integrated software solutions for automating and integrating data and work flows across the investment management organization  as well as the information flows between the investment management organization and external parties 
our products are intended to increase operational efficiency  improve the accuracy of client information and enable better decision making 
each solution focuses on specific mission critical functions of the front  middle and back offices of investment management organizations and is tailored to meet the needs of the particular client  as determined by size  assets under management and complexity of the investment environment 
during fiscal  we expanded customer relationships and acceptance of our product offerings 
during  we signed new customer agreements and experienced continued strong demand for both our newest and largest portfolio management and accounting platforms advent portfolio exchange apx and geneva  respectively 
we sold apx licenses bringing the total number of licenses sold to for a product that has been generally available for just over a year 
we also achieved a significant milestone with geneva as we added new geneva clients during fiscal  compared to new customers in  bringing the total number of geneva licenses sold to over as of december  released new products 
we introduced several product upgrades and enhancements apx  which delivers expanded scalability and enhanced integration of relationship and portfolio management features 
apx enables asset managers and single or multi family offices the ability to provide enhanced client service in a single solution  thus reducing the cost and complexity of managing multiple systems  geneva  which provides a lower total cost of ownership through reduced hardware costs  ease of integration with enhanced third party accelerators  and improved scalability through technology enhancements  moxy  which offers increased scalability and enables higher trade volume execution  advent partner  which enables hedge funds and fund administrators to use a single solution for both onshore and offshore investor servicing and accounting  and gifts  which is a follow on upgrade on microedge s gifts grant making software  and includes the ability to automate and schedule the creation and delivery of gifts reports  a wide range of compatibility certifications not previously available  single sign on support for gifts connections  and background scheduling of database maintenance 
increased term license bookings 
in  we signed a total of million of term licenses  versus million in increased headcount 
total company headcount at december  was which represented an increase of new employees  or  from december  the majority of these new hires were in our sales and services groups  and to a lesser extent in product development 
term license transition we are in the process of converting our software licensing model from a perpetual model to a term model for our advent investment management segment 
under a perpetual model  customers purchase a license to use our software indefinitely and generally we recognize all license revenue at the time of sale  maintenance is purchased under an annual renewable contract  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
under a term model  customers purchase a license to use our software and receive maintenance for a limited period of time and we recognize the revenue ratably over the length of the contract 
the transition to a term model has the effect of lowering license revenues in the early stages of the transition  but increasing the total potential value of the customer relationship 
moving our core business new customer sales to term has had the effect of lowering our revenue growth in and may continue to slow our revenue growth over the next several years when compared to a perpetual license model 
the transition to a term model also has the effect of decreasing our operating cash flows in the early stages of the transition 
under perpetual pricing  the entire license fee is generally billed and collected at the commencement of the arrangement 
under term pricing  a typical contract term is three years 
we generally bill and collect license fees over the term of the arrangement in equal installments in advance of each annual period 
the amount of the annual term billing is less than the perpetual billing  resulting in lower cash flows in the initial term license period 
annual term billing results in an increase in deferred revenues and an increase in operating cash flows at the commencement of each annual billing period 
when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are complete 
if the implementation services are still in progress as of a quarter end  we will defer all of the contract revenues to a subsequent quarter 
as of december   we have deferred million in net revenues and million of directly related expenses which are classified as deferred revenues and prepaid expenses and other  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet as the implementation services associated with the related term license arrangements were in progress as of december  as of december   million of net revenues and million of directly related expenses  respectively  were deferred 
although the transition to a term model decreases revenues from new contracts in the early periods  we believe this change to our business model is extremely significant for the long term growth and value of the business because it leverages the mission critical nature of advent s products and services 
we believe that once our products are implemented  our clients are motivated to continue using advent s products and services due to improved workflow efficiencies and additional controls they gain over their core business operations 
the following table unaudited summarizes the term license bookings in thousands and associated average term in years by quarter for fiscal  and first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total bookings average term bookings average term bookings average term bookings reflect the total value of all new term licenses signed by clients in the period 
average term is weighted by contract value for all new term licenses signed in the period 
financial highlights we recognized record revenues of million during  as compared to million in fiscal and million in the year over year increase in reflects essentially flat license revenues due to our transition to term licenses  while our maintenance and recurring revenues were up million or year over year 
despite our transition to a predominantly term licensing model  we have grown net revenue year over year for two reasons our diverse mix of products has allowed us to phase in term licensing by product  and we have a large installed base of customers that we are not requiring to convert to term licenses when they expand the usage eg order additional seats of products they already own 
during  we recognized approximately of license revenue from term licenses and incremental aua fees versus in total recurring revenues  which we define as term license  incremental aua fees  term and perpetual maintenance  and other recurring revenues  have increased to of total revenues during  as compared to during total expenses  including cost of revenues  were million in fiscal  compared with million in and million in our expenses increased in from largely as a result of increases in headcount  stock based compensation expense of million or of total net revenues and a million increase in restructuring charges and  to a lesser extent  higher bonuses based on strong bookings performance and additional costs resulting from winding down the soft dollar component of second street securities 
during  we incurred restructuring charges of million primarily relating to the exit of our previous headquarters facility 
to accommodate our expansion and headcount growth  we moved our san francisco headquarters in october from our prior facility located at brannan street to a new facility located at townsend street 
as a result of completely exiting our former headquarters facility and making it available for sub lease in november  we incurred facility and exit costs of million related to the brannan facility that will continue to be incurred without economic benefit to us 
the costs associated with stock based compensation and restructuring  which totaled approximately million or of total net revenues for fiscal  had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  resulting in an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million in fiscal during the first quarter of  we began to wind down the soft dollar component of our sec registered broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  as it no longer fits with our corporate strategy 
second street securities offered our customers the ability to pay for advent products and other third party services through brokerage commissions and other fee based arrangements 
we completed the wind down in the fourth quarter of subsequent to the wind down  second street securities will continue to maintain its broker dealer status 
during  we recognized a benefit from income taxes of million due primarily to the release of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets originally established in the fourth quarter of as we now believe that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not be realized 
we earned net income of million  resulting in diluted earnings per share of for in addition  we generated operating cash flow of approximately million in during  we repurchased million shares under our board authorized share repurchase plans  for a total cash outlay of million and an average price of 
looking forward  we continue to focus on improving our long term profitability as we complete the transition to a term license model 
while recent economic trends have been positive and our customers have been more willing to commit to new software purchases  improving our profitability will depend upon our introducing new products  licensing software to new and existing customers  selling services to new and existing customers and renewing license  maintenance and recurring revenue contracts at similar levels to those which we achieved during fiscal the success of our transition to a term license model will also depend on future renewal rates  which we will evaluate as our term license contracts expire 
we will continue our focus on aggressively managing costs and will also continue to invest in areas we deem appropriate 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the process we use to develop estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other information that we believe are reasonable for making judgments at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill revenue recognition and deferred revenues income taxes stock based compensation restructuring charges and related accruals impairment of long lived assets legal contingencies sales returns and accounts receivable allowances goodwill 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of november and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we had three reporting units as of november  the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used to calculate future cash flows  the selection of risk adjusted discount rates  and determination of market comparable entities 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment for any of our reporting units 
revenue recognition and deferred revenues 
our revenue recognition policies contain our most significant judgments and estimates 
our revenue policy is further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from software licenses  development fees  maintenance  other recurring revenues  professional services and other revenues 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant judgment in the application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software license and development fees 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized once shipment to the distributor s customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  and if such acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we also assess whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less  unless the transaction was part of a soft dollar arrangement through our in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  for which payment was then required within one year  however  payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
licenses we have continued the transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of perpetual and term contracts  and expect term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total license revenue in the future 
we recognized approximately  and of license revenue from term licenses and incremental aua fees during fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue recognition for software licensed under perpetual and term based license models differs depending on which type of contract a customer signs perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred 
term licenses term license contract prices include both the software license fees and maintenance fees  and  as a result  we allocate of the contract price to license revenue and to maintenance and recurring revenues  based on our assessment of the relative economic value of the two elements 
we used our judgment in determining the allocation of revenues for term license contracts 
we believe our methodology provides the best estimate of the gross margins of our revenue streams 
our assessment of the relative economic value is based on an analysis of the revenue stream that could be expected from a perpetual license and associated maintenance renewals over a three year term  which is the length of most of our term licenses with bundled maintenance 
as a percentage of the total term arrangement fee  the maintenance component was calculated to be approximately of the overall arrangement fee over a three year period 
to date  we have offered multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment to license the software for a fixed multi year term typically three years 
for multi year term licenses  we have not established vsoe of fair value for the term license and maintenance components  and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the professional services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license and maintenance revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
term license and maintenance revenue for the remaining contract years is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the contract 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license and maintenance revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain of our perpetual and term license contracts contain fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using our software assets under administration or aua 
contracts containing an aua fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self report actual aua in arrears of the specified period 
aua fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees 
because incremental fees are not determinable until the conclusion of the measurement period  they are both earned and recognized in arrears  on a quarterly or annual basis 
if a customer purchased our software and chose to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through our in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  the soft dollar arrangement did not change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract 
the customer is required to pay the original fee for our software within one year 
if insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within one year  the customer is still required to render payment within one year 
if the customer chooses to use a third party broker dealer  the original payment terms apply  regardless of the arrangement with the third party broker dealer 
the option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction  all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the software license section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled under perpetual licenses in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon renewal rates stated in the contracts or  in limited cases  separate sales of renewals to other customers 
generally  we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term  except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
revenues from term licenses represented approximately  and of maintenance and other recurring revenue during  and  respectively 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription based or transaction based  and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to  and the capability to download securities information from  third party data providers 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of these services by us to other customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
our professional services and other revenue also include revenue from our annual client conferences 
we recognize revenue as these professional services are performed except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria 
in these cases  revenue and directly related expenses are deferred and then recognized upon acceptance 
directly related expenses 
when we defer service revenues  we also defer the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through the future revenues on non cancelable contracts 
we recognize those deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue 
when we defer license revenue  we defer the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract ie sales commissions earned by the salesforce as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract 
we recognize those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that have differing or preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions to reasonably allocate earnings 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  the final outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our income tax provision and accruals 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdiction where the tax asset is located 
we consider forecasted earnings  future taxable income and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the return is filed and the tax implication is known 
we are subject to audits by state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
our estimates for potential outcome for any uncertain tax matter are judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas r on january  had a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
see note  stock based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our stock based compensation including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense 
the calculation of stock based compensation requires reliance on significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
management judgment was required in the initial selection and implementation of policies to conform with the requirements of sfas r 
management elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective method  to utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of expense and to recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period 
had management selected other implementation  valuation or recognition methodologies  the presented result could vary significantly 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  stock appreciation rights sar and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behavior  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use an external service provider to assist us in making reasonable estimates 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
we determined that a blend of historical and implied volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options and sar s granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option and sar 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on the company s historical experience over the last ten years 
these variables are sensitive and change on a daily basis 
as a result  the financial result from issuing the same number of options or sar s can vary over significantly over time 
the following table reflects the change in the fair value of a hypothetical option or sar as a result of a hypothetical change in the underlying assumptions assumption value assumption value assumption base case change change change change grant and stock price risk free interest rate volatility expected life years year year expected dividend yield base option value restructuring charges and related accruals 
since  we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred is subjective and requires judgment 
our recoverability test compares the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
we estimate future revenue and expense amounts to calculate future cash flows 
we believe our forecast revenue and expense amounts are reasonable but forecast amounts are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
legal contingencies 
from time to time  advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we use our judgment to assess both the likelihood and potential amount of a contingency 
we periodically review our assessment whenever there is a change in the facts and circumstances of these proceedings 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 
we use our judgment in estimating our sales returns 
we analyze customer demand and acceptance of product and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are not generally provided to customers 
specifically  we have an algorithm for calculating the value of reserves that takes the last months of experience into account  which resulted in the above adjustments to revenue 
our ability to estimate returns is based on our long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we have recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use our judgment in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms 
we have recorded a provision for reduction of bad debt of million  million and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation to better reflect our view of the current business 
these reclassifications do not affect total net revenues  net income loss  cash flows  or stockholders equity 
results of operations for fiscal years  and the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
the financial information and the ensuing discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
fiscal years net revenues license and development fees maintenance and other recurring professional services and other total net revenues cost of revenues license and development fees maintenance and other recurring professional services and other amortization and impairment of developed technology total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization and impairment of other intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other expense  net gain on sale of equity investments income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss net revenues in thousands  except percentages total net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year our net revenues are made up of three components license and development fees  maintenance and other recurring  and professional services and other 
license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products 
maintenance and other recurring revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial licensing year  renewals of annual maintenance services in subsequent years and recurring revenues derived from our subscription based or transaction based services 
term license contract prices include both the software license fees and maintenance fees  and  as a result  we allocate of the contract price to license revenue and to maintenance and recurring revenues  based on our assessment of the relative economic value of the two elements 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  training services  commission revenues from soft dollaring of third party products and services and our client conferences 
each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a percentage of net revenues  and we expect this variability to continue in the near term 
this variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of new products  the relative size and timing of individual perpetual software licenses  as well as the size of the implementation  the resulting proportion of the maintenance and professional services components of these license transactions and the amount of client use of pricing and related data 
we are currently transitioning the majority of our license revenue to term license agreements 
once our transition to term licensing is complete  we expect less variability between our major categories of revenues because the variation from large perpetual license deals will decrease 
net revenues increased in and due to growing information technology spending by our customers  as well as a general increase in demand for many of our products and services 
the increases reflected improving economic conditions and growth in the financial markets 
the year over year growth in net revenues included large increases in term license  maintenance and recurring revenues  as well as increased revenue from international sales 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in perpetual license revenues and professional services and other revenues attributable to our continued transition to a term license sales model 
after adverse economic conditions negatively impacted revenues across the industry in and  the economy stabilized in and has continued to strengthen into and  resulting in shorter sales cycles  growing investment in information technology projects  and a general increase in expenditures for software related services 
going forward  we expect normal seasonal weakness to impact revenues and bookings in the first quarter of  followed by modest growth as the year progresses resulting in total net revenues for fiscal of between million and million 
international sales  which are based on the location to which the product is shipped  also contributed to our growth in and  representing of our net revenues in  compared to in and in we expect revenue growth in emea in to be consistent with our overall revenue growth 
the revenues from customers in any single international country did not exceed of total revenues 
license and development fees in thousands  except percentages license and development fees percent of net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year the increase in license and development fee revenues in and as compared to primarily reflected the improving economic and industry conditions resulting in increased capital spending by our customers as well as increased acceptance of our apx and geneva products 
however  the decrease in as compared to is a direct result of the transition to selling our core products under a term model where license revenue is amortized over the term of the contract  as opposed to being recognized up front with perpetual contracts 
perpetual license revenue decreased million to million during fiscal compared to million in  and decreased million in compared with million in revenue recognized from term license contracts and incremental aua fees increased million to million  or of license revenue  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of license revenue  during fiscal  and million or of license revenue in term contract sales have the effect of lowering recognized license revenues in the short term  but we believe increase the total potential long term value of the customer relationship 
we continue to sign more contracts on a term basis as term license bookings increased from million in fiscal year  to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
improving financial markets in these periods resulted in a more favorable business climate as our customers were more willing to commit to new software purchases as well as existing customer upgrades 
for each of the periods presented  the axys  apx  moxy  partner  qube  geneva and gifts products accounted for the majority of license revenue  both term and perpetual 
license and development fee revenues in also reflected an increase in geneva related assets under administration aua revenues and  as previously mentioned  increasing term license revenues as our transition to a term model continued 
our aua revenues from incremental aua fees increased by million during as a result of the growth in assets under administration of certain fund administration clients  whose geneva contracts provide for incremental fees based on assets under administration  resulting in significant recurring quarterly and annual revenue 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the number of site installations  the number of authorized users  the size of the customer and the customer s line of business 
our pricing can vary in different market segments to maintain our competitive position 
we earn development fees when we provide product solutions that are not part of our standard product offering but that will be incorporated into our future releases 
for fiscal years  and  revenue from development fees was  and of total license and development fees revenue 
soft dollar revenues generated by second street securities from advent related licenses paid for through soft dollar transactions in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented  and of total license and development fee revenues 
due to the winding down of our soft dollar component during fiscal  we do not expect to recognize soft dollar revenues through second street securities in fiscal we expect license and development fees revenues to be up significantly in amount and as a percentage of total net revenues in as we have reached the turning point in our transition to a term model and expect to grow license revenues compared to due principally to continued bookings of both term and some perpetual licenses and recognition of term license revenue deferred in prior years 
as we sell more products on a term license model  we defer a greater portion of license revenue over the term of the contract  instead of recognizing the license revenue up front 
the net effect  assuming most customers renew their contracts upon expiration of the initial term  is to build a long term license and maintenance stream and also enhance predictability of license revenues 
maintenance and other recurring revenues in thousands  except percentages maintenance revenues other recurring revenues total maintenance and other recurring revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year the increases in maintenance and other recurring revenues in and reflected an increase in new maintenance support contracts as a result of the increase in the number of new license contracts  price increases and service level upgrades to our installed customer base  an increase in demand for our data services and an increase in our recurring revenue sharing 
we disclose our maintenance renewal rate one quarter in arrears 
the maintenance renewal rate for the third quarter of of which is the highest it has been for the last three years 
maintenance revenues increased by million and million in and  respectively  reflecting an increase in new maintenance support contracts as a result of the increase in the number of new license deals both perpetual and term and price increases to our installed customer base 
perpetual maintenance revenue increased million or over the prior year reflecting the annual increase in maintenance pricing and up selling to higher value maintenance plans 
term maintenance increased million or over fiscal reflecting the continued success of the term model for geneva  apx  partner and moxy products 
recurring revenues increased by million and million in and  respectively  primarily reflecting increased revenue from our advent custodial data services 
maintenance revenue has remained relatively flat as a proportion of total maintenance and recurring revenues at approximately to for fiscal  and  and we expect this percentage to be consistent in we expect that maintenance and recurring revenues will continue to increase in  but at a slower rate than in which experienced growth  due to the volume of new contracts  a historically high contract renewal rate  and expected price increases in  partially offset by normal attrition within our existing customer base 
professional services and other revenues in thousands  except percentages professional services and other revenues percent of net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year professional services and other revenues include consulting  project management  custom integration  custom work  training and soft dollar transactions for products and services not related to advent product or services 
professional services projects related to axys  moxy and partner products generally can be completed in a two to six month time period  while services related to geneva and apx products may require a four to nine month implementation period 
the decrease in professional services and other revenues of million in was primarily attributable to the net deferral of professional services revenue for services performed on term license implementations 
when services are performed with term license implementations  service revenue is deferred until the implementation is complete 
then service revenues are recognized over the remaining license term 
we have experienced an increase in implementation services after the launch of our apx product and the sales success of our geneva product  which are sold under a term license model 
there were more term license implementation projects in progress as of december  compared with the prior year  and as a result there was a significant increase in the deferral of professional services revenue 
we deferred net professional services revenues of approximately million in as compared to million in in addition  revenues earned from third party products paid for through soft dollar transactions decreased due to fewer transactions as we completed the wind down of the soft dollar component of second street securities in the fourth quarter of the increase in professional services and other revenues of million in was primarily due to a general increase in the volume of consulting and training services demanded as a result of higher license sales 
we expect that professional services and other revenues will increase in as we expect to add more billable headcount to support project implementation growth  and we expect to recognize revenue from term deals upon completion of implementation during revenues by segment in thousands advent investment management microedge other total we have two reportable segments advent investment management aim and microedge 
aim derives revenues from the development  marketing and sale of software products  data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate  integrate and support certain mission critical functions of investment management organizations 
microedge derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant management  gifts matching and volunteer tracking for the grant making community 
see note  segment and geographical information  to our consolidated financial statements 
the and increases in aim s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  reflected the improved economic conditions and growth in the financial markets  as well as the continued focus on selling our axys  apx  moxy  partner and geneva products 
aim s revenue increases in and also reflected an increase in new maintenance support contracts as a result of new license deals  up selling existing customers to higher value maintenance plans and price increases for maintenance contracts from our installed customer base  partially offset by attrition from within our existing installed customer base 
we also had growth in international sales in both periods  partly attributable to our acquisitions of distributor businesses in the uk and switzerland in may our assets under administration revenues increased by million and million in and  respectively  as a result of the growth in assets under administration for our fund administration clients  where certain geneva contracts provide for fees based on assets under administration  resulting in significant recurring revenue 
the technology spending patterns of organizations in microedge s primary markets independent foundations  community foundations and corporations are directly affected by economic fluctuations as foundation budgets are largely driven by endowment income 
given that endowments often contain market exposed components  they are significantly affected by the economy 
for instance  foundation spending decreases in an economic downturn 
community foundations are subject to similar influences  compounded by the fact that in many cases much of their ongoing funding and endowment comes from active donors who may increase or reduce their giving depending on the economic climate and the related effect on their income and wealth 
corporations typically fund charitable activities from operating budgets  and the allocation to charitable donations and supporting company charitable operations is often closely tied to a company s performance 
thus  corporate philanthropy and spending on related technology are correlated with company and overall economic performance 
the increase in microedge revenues in fiscal primarily reflected an increase in maintenance revenues due to price increases and continued strong customer retention 
the increase in microedge revenues in fiscal reflected the improved economic conditions and growth in the financial markets which resulted in increased charitable contributions 
the increase in charitable contributions received by the foundations sector in these periods enabled foundations to increase their information technology expenditures which resulted in the increase in microedge revenues 
the revenue decrease in our other segment in fiscal primarily resulted from the winding down of the soft dollar component of our broker dealer subsidiary

the increase in costs during was primarily due to increase in payroll related expenses and higher utilization of outside contractors 
payroll related expenses increased by  due to an additional employee in the department during fiscal as compared to fiscal higher utilization of outside services also contributed to  of the increase during the decrease in reflected decreased outside service costs  and shipping and related product demo costs 
in absolute dollars  we expect cost of license and development fees in to be slightly higher compared with cost of maintenance and other recurring in thousands  except percentages cost of maintenance and other recurring percent of total maintenance and other recurring revenue change over prior year percent change over prior year cost of maintenance and other recurring revenues is primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support and other services for recurring revenues and royalties paid to third party vendors for subscription or transaction based revenues 
the increase of million in was due primarily to an increase in compensation and related costs of million  respectively  resulting from an increase in stock based compensation costs and headcount 
specifically  stock based compensation costs of  were recognized during fiscal primarily as a result of implementing sfas r effective january  and issuing restricted stock units rsu compared with zero in payroll related expenses increased by million as a result of an increase in headcount from at december  to at december  consistent with the increase in headcount  travel expenses and recruiting costs increased by  during this increase was offset by a decrease in royalty expense of million for the increase in was primarily due to increased compensation expense of million associated with higher headcount during and royalty expense of million

cost of professional services and other in thousands  except percentages cost of professional services and other percent of total professional services revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs associated with the client services and support organization in providing consulting  custom report writing and conversions of data from clients previous systems 
also included are direct costs associated with third party consultants and travel expenses 
the increase in primarily reflects the higher costs from payroll and related expenses  higher utilization of outside services  recruiting expenses  and travel costs 
payroll related expenses increased by million during as a result of an increase in headcount and stock based compensation 
as a result of the increases in our license transactions and customer base in  we have increased headcount in our client services and consulting groups to at december  from at december  consistent with the increase in headcount  recruiting costs increased by  during fiscal stock based compensation costs of  were recognized during  compared with zero in higher utilization of outside services  including third parties to assist in our professional service projects  also contributed to  of the increase during in addition  travel expenses increased by million due to travel associated with more professional service projects 
these cost increases were partially offset by larger net deferrals of professional services costs under sop related to services performed on term license implementations 
we have experienced an increase in implementation services with the launch of our apx product and sales of our geneva product  which are principally sold under the term license model 
as there were more term license implementation projects in progress as of december  compared to the prior year  we have experienced an increase in the deferral of professional service costs 
we deferred net professional services costs of million during compared to million in gross margins for were negatively impacted by our deferral of professional services revenues and costs under sop  as we defer only the direct costs associated with services performed on term license arrangements 
as a result  indirect costs such as management and other overhead expenses are recognized in the period in which they are incurred  with no revenue to offset them 
in addition  we have added headcount in both our client services and consulting groups 
since these new employees undergo a training period typically of six months before becoming fully billable  their associated costs have a near term negative impact on margins 
gross margin for was also negatively impacted by million of write offs and reserves incurred in the first quarter of associated with third party products paid through soft dollar transactions 
excluding the effects of our deferrals and the headcount increases  we forecast a gross margin on our professional services 
however  we presently expect our deferrals and headcount increases to negatively affect our professional services gross margins for at least the next twelve months 
the increase in was primarily due to higher compensation expense of million as a result of our incurring a full year of payroll expense from additional headcount related to our acquisitions of distributor businesses in the united kingdom and switzerland in may  and additional costs of million from our annual user conference 
we anticipate cost of professional services and other revenues in to increase significantly but at a slower rate than revenue over as we expect to add headcount to support an increased number of implementations  the majority of which will be sold on a term basis

we incurred approximately million of bad debt expense during associated with the winding down of our soft dollar component 
travel expense and marketing expense increased by  and  respectively  during payroll related expenses increased by million during due to higher bonus and incentive awards resulting from strong bookings performance  a headcount increase from at december  to at december   and the allocation of it personnel costs as certain it employees were working on projects specifically relating to the sales and marketing function 
the increase in was attributable to increased compensation expenses of million due to higher commissions and bonus expense associated with higher levels of revenue 
marketing expenses increased million primarily as a result of our apx product launch 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in bad debt and royalty expenses and million in outside services associated with decreased utilization of external consultants

in addition  payroll and other related costs increased by million during as a result of an increase in headcount 
we capitalized million of software development costs in both fiscal and the decrease in was due primarily to the capitalization of software development costs of million during in fiscal  we had several major products  including apx  in their final beta phase

the overall fluctuations were also attributable to a decrease in legal fees of million in as compared to fiscal which included costs for various legal disputes 
a decrease in depreciation expense of million for also contributed to the overall decrease in general and administrative expense which primarily resulted from assets being fully depreciated in outside service costs decreased by  in as fewer external consultants were used during the current year 
these decreases were offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense of million or of total net revenues during  and an increase in rent expense of approximately million 
we entered into a definitive lease agreement in january for our new headquarters facility located at townsend street in san francisco  california and since then we incurred rent expense at both townsend and our prior headquarters facility located at brannan street for the majority of fiscal which resulted in higher rent expense for the increase of million in was primarily due to higher legal and professional fees of million  payroll and related costs of million  outside service costs of million and computer and telecom expense of million  partially offset by decreased facility expense of million 
the increase in professional fees was primarily due to an increase in legal fees of million for various inquiries and disputes  including our ongoing litigation with the former shareholders of kinexus  costs of million to settle the claims of certain former members and employees of advent outsource data management  and additional accounting costs of million for our year end audit of financial statements and internal controls and other associated compliance costs 
the increase in personnel and related costs of million in was primarily due to severance for terminated employees and a full year of payroll expense from additional headcount related to our acquisitions of our remaining independent distributor businesses in the united kingdom and switzerland in may the increase in outside services of million was primarily due to costs associated with increased utilization of outside contractors 
these increases in general and administrative expenses during were partially offset by decreased facility expense as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce excess office space

we evaluated the positive and negative evidence and determined that the eventual realization of these assets became more likely than not in the fourth quarter of this assessment was primarily based on our consistently positive financial results over the previous eight quarters and a positive income outlook that is supported by recurring revenue streams  many of which are generated by customer agreements already under contract

cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred revenue of million  accrued liabilities of million and income taxes payable of million 
the increase in deferred revenue primarily reflected our continued transition to a term license model 
under the term model  we generally bill and collect for a term arrangement in equal installments in advance of each annual period 
these amounts are deferred at billing and recognized over the annual term period 
this has the effect of increasing deferred revenue when compared with a perpetual license model where no license revenue is deferred 
see further discussion of the effects of our transition to a term model in the overview section 
the increase in accrued liabilities primarily reflected increases in accrued bonuses and restructuring expenses relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters

under the facility  the lender will provide the company with a revolving line of credit up to an aggregate amount of million  subject to a borrowing base formula  to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes  including stock repurchases  or investment opportunities for a period of three years 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  our operating expenses and common stock repurchases will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions or invest in other businesses  when opportunities arise 
based upon our past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operations and availability under our facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and financing activities for the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent netherlands  and advent europe s remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose service and certain license revenues and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally as of december   million and million of goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition of these entities is denominated in foreign currency 
therefore a hypothetical change of could increase or decrease our assets and equity by million 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of december  an immediate sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  immediate sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and the majority of our investment portfolio at december  and had interest rate maturities of less than one year 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  bps and bps would result in a reduction of   and  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december  we have also invested in several privately held companies  most of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is our policy to review investments in privately held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
our investments in privately held companies are assessed for impairment when a review of the investee s operations indicates that a decline in value of the investment is other than temporary 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  limited prospects of receiving additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
at december   our net investments in privately held companies totaled million  which was principally comprised of our investment in latentzero limited  a privately held company located in the united kingdom
