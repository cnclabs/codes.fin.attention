item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report  and with other factors described from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market both implantable and disposable medical devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
we also are developing products for the treatment of ischemic disease and have recently launched our first product in this market 
our products are used by interventional neuroradiologists and 
table of contents neurosurgeons to treat cerebral aneurysms responsible for hemorrhagic stroke 
both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke are significant causes of death worldwide 
our product lines consist of endovascular systems that enable a physician to gain access to the brain in a minimally invasive manner through the vessels of the arterial system 
we believe our products provide a safe and reliable alternative to more invasive neurosurgical procedures for treating aneurysms 
our proprietary three dimensional  embolic coils are unique in that they automatically and rapidly deploy within an aneurysm  forming a scaffold that conforms to a wide diversity of aneurysm shapes and sizes 
we also supply accessory devices and products including microcatheters and guidewires used to deliver microcoils and stents for the treatment of cerebral vascular disease 
we plan on growing our business by continuing to penetrate our existing markets  bringing new products and technologies to interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons  and by entering new geographic territories such as asia where we introduced our products in japan through a distributor 
we commenced selling our products in japan in march our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils 
we also sell access devices  which currently do not account for a significant portion of our revenues 
geographically  our revenues are generally from sales to customers in the americas  europe and asia 
our products are shipped from our facilities in the united states  switzerland  united kingdom  and a logistics facility in the netherlands  to either hospitals or distributors 
we invoice our customers upon shipment 
in select hospitals  our products are held on consignment  and remain on site  free of charge until used 
we anticipate that our cost of goods sold will generally increase in absolute dollars during those quarters in which our sales increase or we incur additional manufacturing costs in anticipation of the commercial introduction of new products 
furthermore  our gross margin percentage may decrease in those quarters in which we initiate sales of new products or product lines  or enter new geographic territories 
our product development efforts are primarily focused on expanding our current line of microcoils and broadening our product offerings 
in august  we introduced our cerecyte microcoil product line and since june we have launched seven new products in the last months  including microcoils  stents  microcatheters and guidewires 
we intend to continue this product line expansion with the goal of continuing to increase our per procedure revenue 
we also intend to continue to expand our direct sales force in the united states and europe as necessary and enter the asian markets through distributors 
in march  we launched our sales and marketing efforts in japan through our distribution partner  goodman 
we recorded product sales to goodman of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the sales to goodman accounted for of revenues for the year ended march  we currently anticipate that the broadening of our product line  the worldwide expansion of our direct sales force and our entry into the asian market will be primarily funded with our currently available cash 
we introduced our first proprietary  three dimensional microcoil in may our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal since inception  we have been unprofitable 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe that our current cash position and the cash expected to be generated from product sales will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future as we expand our manufacturing and sales activities and expand geographically 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
recent developments vascon acquisition 
on november   we completed the acquisition of vascon llc vascon  a privately held company engaged in the development and manufacture of vascular access and delivery devices 
the acquisition of vascon adds expertise in developing clinically advanced access and catheter systems to our core competencies and provides us with manufacturing capabilities that are expected to lead to cost reductions for a wide range of our products 
vascon s existing cardio and peripheral vascular products will continue to be sold through 
table of contents non micrus distribution channels 
micrus design technology  inc  a newly formed subsidiary  will develop and manufacture neurovascular access and delivery products for us  including our steerable catheter 
the transaction consisted of an up front payment and additional contingent earn out payments as described below 
the total consideration paid of approximately million as of march   consisted of the payment of approximately million in cash  the issuance of  shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of approximately million calculated based on the average closing price two days before and the day of the acquisition  and  in acquisition related closing costs 
additionally  vascon may receive certain earn out payments in an amount not to exceed million based on sales and manufacturing performance as set forth in the asset purchase agreement entered into by the parties 
the common stock portion of the up front payment was placed in escrow to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of vascon and its members as described in such asset purchase agreement 
the results of operations of vascon are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods or partial periods subsequent to the acquisition date 
the purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition as determined by management 
as of march   the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the up front purchase consideration resulting in negative goodwill in the amount of million 
because the acquisition involves contingent consideration  the negative goodwill has been recorded as a deferred credit non current liability in the consolidated balance sheet and will be reduced by the contingent consideration of up to million that will be paid over the next three years  with any additional contingent consideration being recorded as goodwill 
we acquired certain intangible assets in the amount of million in connection with the acquisition of vascon 
these intangible assets are comprised of existing process technology of million  existing product technology of  and patents of  purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over a weighted average period of approximately seven years 
secondary public offering 
on july  we completed a secondary public offering in which certain stockholders sold  shares of common stock at the public offering price of per share 
on july   the underwriters purchased  shares of common stock from us pursuant to the exercise of their over allotment option 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders 
the total cash proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option were approximately million  net of the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
common stock offering expenses of million were incurred by us on behalf of the selling stockholders and were expensed to general and administrative expense in the second quarter of fiscal adoption of sfas r 
on april   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we transitioned to sfas r using the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding prior to the effective date and are subsequently modified 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas pro forma disclosures  excluding pre ipo options for which the fair value was determined using the minimum value method 
for these grants  any remaining unamortized deferred compensation expenses will continue to be accounted for under the intrinsic value method of apb the adoption of sfas r had and will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the sfas r disclosures

the overall increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the number of microcoil products sold during this period 
factors driving the increase included growth in the overall market for embolic coils  an increase in our share of both the domestic and foreign markets in which we participate  expansion of our direct and distributor sales force and the introduction of new products 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from sales of products released in the last months  compared with approximately in fiscal additionally  the increase in revenues was partially due to higher average selling prices as a result of increased cerecyte product sales in fiscal the increase in revenues from asia pacific in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to

the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in personnel and manufacturing costs associated with increased sales of our products as well as increased costs attributable to a general increase in salaries  benefits and overhead costs resulting from increased production partially offset by increased manufacturing efficiencies 
cost of goods sold in fiscal includes the amortization of intangibles acquired from the acquisition of vascon on november  and the amortization of capitalized license fees which we started to amortize in the third quarter of fiscal when we began selling the pharos product and generating revenue 
additionally  non cash stock based compensation expense included in cost of goods sold was  and  in fiscal and  respectively  with the increase primarily due to the adoption of sfas r 
gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sales of higher margin products and manufacturing efficiencies  partially offset by higher levels of distributor sales of lower margin products primarily in japan and certain european markets 
we expect our gross margin to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of our product sales 
operating expenses research and development years ended march  change dollars in thousands research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design  development  and testing of products 
such costs are expensed as they are incurred and include salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to outside consultants  and other direct and indirect costs related to research and product development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in outside services and consulting fees related to new product development  an increase of million related to increased headcount  an increase of  in supplies expense  as well as an increase of  in stock based compensation expense primarily due to the adoption of sfas r in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million primarily due to the purchase of intellectual property from vascular fx in fiscal we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional development personnel  continue work on product improvements  and expand our existing product line 
sales and marketing years ended march  change dollars in thousands sales and marketing 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs of our direct sales force and marketing personnel  as well as overhead costs related to these activities

we had a total income tax benefit of approximately   and zero in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we accrued a foreign current tax benefit of approximately  compared to a foreign current tax benefit of  in fiscal the current year benefit is primarily attributable to additional benefited losses in the uk for the period after the neurologic acquisition date 
in fiscal  we accrued a foreign deferred tax benefit of approximately  compared to a foreign deferred tax benefit of  in fiscal the increase in foreign deferred tax benefit in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in tax benefit for the tax effect of the current year amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the neurologic transaction which are not deductible

the federal tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in the state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration  we have recorded a valuation allowance at march  to offset our federal and state deferred tax assets 
at march   a valuation allowance was recorded to fully offset the deferred tax assets

accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock to redemption value our convertible preferred stock that was outstanding prior to the closing of our initial public offering in june was redeemable at the request of the holder on or after the sixth anniversary of the original issuance date based upon certain circumstances 
this right expired upon the automatic conversion of all of our preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of the ipo 
prior to the closing of the ipo  we were accreting the carrying value of the preferred stock to the mandatory redemption amount on the sixth anniversary using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
we recorded a non cash charge of  and million for the accretion on our redeemable convertible preferred stock in fiscal and  respectively 
beneficial conversion feature the difference between the proceeds allocated to the series e preferred stock and the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable upon conversion resulted in a beneficial conversion feature on the series e preferred stock which was recorded as a reduction to the series e preferred stock and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the total beneficial conversion feature was  which  prior to the completion of the ipo  was being amortized as a reduction of net income available to common stockholders over the period of redemption of the series e preferred stock

net cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million during fiscal net cash used in operating activities during fiscal resulted primarily from operating losses  an increase in inventory due to the buildup of finished goods inventory in anticipation of future sales and an increase in the number of consignment locations  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily related to the payment of directors and officers insurance premiums  a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments made to our vendors and a decrease in other non current liabilities primarily related to contingent purchase price associated with the vascon acquisition 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable due to improved collection efforts which resulted in lower days sales outstanding  an increase in accrued payroll and related expenses attributable to increased headcount and the timing of payroll payments  an increase in accrued liabilities due to higher accrued professional fees associated with legal fees and sarbanes oxley compliance and higher vat payables  and non cash items such as stock based compensation expense primarily due to the adoption of sfas r  depreciation and amortization  and provision for excess and obsolete of inventories 
net cash used in operating activities during fiscal resulted primarily from operating losses  an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in the number of microcoil products sold  including the initial sales to our distributor in japan in march  and a decrease in accounts payable primarily attributable to payments of audit fees related to our ipo and payments to the doj and payment of other legal costs related to foreign corrupt practices act fcpa matters

net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was primarily related to the purchase of neurologic  the purchase of capital equipment primarily related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities  and the milestone payment to biotronik which has been capitalized as capitalized license technology 
net cash provided 
table of contents by investing activities during fiscal was primarily related to the proceeds from sales of marketable securities  partially offset by the purchase of capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal and million during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of net proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option by the underwriters in connection with our secondary offering  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our ipo  net proceeds from the over allotment option exercise by the underwriters  proceeds from the exercise of preferred and common stock warrants  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchased common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by payments related to issuance costs for preferred stock 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of series e preferred stock and warrants and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and preferred stock warrants  partially offset by the expenditures incurred in preparation for the ipo 
to the extent that existing cash and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any definitive agreement with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into such agreements in the future  which could require us to seek additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in doing so  we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates  which we discuss below 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our accounting advisors  audit committee and board of directors 
although our significant policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of our microcoil product line and related equipment and accessories to hospitals and third party distributors 
revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized generally upon shipment  after the receipt of a replenishment or purchase order  except sales made to our south american distributors 
due to longer delays in receiving payments and a higher level of write offs relating to our south american distributors  we have been unable to conclude that collectibility is reasonably assured at the time that the customer takes title to the inventory on sales to this class of customers 
accordingly  for this class of customers  we recognize revenues when collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally when cash is collected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering changes in customers financial condition and the aging of account receivable balances 
if there are unanticipated future events  this allowance may need to be adjusted 

table of contents our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts and for product returns of  and  at march  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we calculate an inventory provision for estimated obsolescence or excess inventories based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our products have a three year shelf life  with the exception of our cerecyte microcoils  which have a two year shelf life 
our products are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative products 
our inventory  which consists primarily of microcoils  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional provision based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the provision for excess and obsolete inventories result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our federal and state net deferred tax assets as of march  and a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas r on april  we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
due to the adoption of sfas r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from april  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we have elected to follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing our research and development tax credit 
we will recognize the full effect of these deductions in the statements of operations when the valuation allowance is released 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
because there is insufficient historical information available to estimate the expected term of the stock based awards  we adopted the simplified method for estimating the expected term pursuant to sab on this basis  we estimated the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
the expected volatility used in the valuation model is based our peer group in the industry in which we do business and our historical volatility since our ipo 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb issued financial accounting standards interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
step one  recognition  occurs when a company concludes that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
step two  measurement  is based on the largest amount of benefit  which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle to be recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings and therefore are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently in the process of evaluating the effects of adopting fin and the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of sfas will change current practice 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating sfas to determine its impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risks 
historically  we have been exposed to risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to intercompany loans made to micrus sa  our swiss subsidiary  in in connection with its incorporation 
these loans are denominated in swiss francs and will fluctuate in value against the us dollar  causing us to recognize foreign exchange gains and losses 
the functional currency of our swiss subsidiary is the swiss franc 
the functional currency of our uk subsidiary is the pound sterling 
in europe  our revenues are denominated in swiss francs  euros  pounds sterling and other currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to market risk related to changes between the swiss franc and these other currencies 
if the swiss franc appreciates against the currencies in which our receivables are denominated  we will recognize foreign currency losses 
for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  the financial results of our swiss subsidiary are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates during the applicable period 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the swiss franc versus the us dollar would cause us to recognize a loss of  related to our loan with micrus sa and a  decrease in our comprehensive loss from our investment in micrus sa 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the pound sterling versus the us dollar would cause us to recognize a  decrease in our comprehensive loss from our investment in micrus uk 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the euro versus the swiss franc would cause us to recognize a loss of  based on our foreign denominated receivables as of march  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in future periods  we believe a greater portion of our revenues could be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  thereby increasing our exposure to exchange rate gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe our currency exposure merits  we may consider entering into transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate market risk 
our cash is invested in bank deposits and money market funds denominated in us dollars 
the carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair market value 
our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk  which is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates
