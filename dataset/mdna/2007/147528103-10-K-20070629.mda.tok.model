item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands please read the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this form k 
overview we derive our revenue from retail sales of food including freshly prepared foods such as pizza  donuts  and sandwiches  beverages  and nonfood products including health and beauty aids  tobacco products  automotive products  and gasoline by corporate stores and wholesale sales of certain merchandise and gasoline to franchise stores 
the company generates relatively minor revenues from continuing monthly royalties based on sales by franchise stores  sign and fa ade rental fees  and the provision of certain maintenance  transportation  and construction services to the company s franchisees 
a typical store generally is not profitable in its first year of operation due to start up costs and usually will attain representative levels of sales and profits during its third or fourth year of operation 
we measure performance using trend analysis and same store comparisons on net sales and gross profit applied to the three business categories of our corporate stores gasoline  grocery other merchandise  and prepared food fountain 
comparisons are also made on operating expenses 
fluctuations in operating expenses are compared with the increase or decrease in gross profit 
wages are the primary component of operating expenses  and we believe we have appropriately aligned store manager compensation with store performance 
store growth is a corporate priority 
we evaluate the location of third party purchases and sites for new construction based on expected financial results and return on investment 
we purchased stores and built in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to  primarily due to a increase in gas prices  an increase in the number of gallons sold  an increase in same store sales  and the net addition of corporate stores 
retail gasoline sales for the fiscal year were  an increase of  and gallons sold increased to  inside sales grocery other merchandise and prepared food fountain increased to  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal compared with for the prior year 
the increase was caused by a decrease in the gas margin to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the higher cost of gasoline 
the grocery other merchandise margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a one time benefit of  related to cigarettes 
the state of iowa substantially increased the excise tax on cigarettes without implementing an inventory floor tax 
without the one time benefit  the margin would have been 
the prepared food fountain margin decreased to from primarily due to our switch to a dual cola program 
operating expenses increased in fiscal  driven by an increase in bank fees resulting from customers greater use of credit cards and higher retail gasoline prices and an increase in the number of corporate stores 
higher gasoline prices decreased the operating expense ratio to of net sales in fiscal from in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due to capital expenditures made in fiscal the effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was in part the result of the prior three years recovery of a permanent tax benefit related to deductions allowed for dividends paid into the company s k plan 
a recurring annual tax benefit will be realized going forward 
the rate also decreased due to a refined and slightly downward rate application to the total net deferred tax liabilities  and a decrease in the tax contingency reserve 

table of contents net earnings from continuing operations increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the slight increase was due primarily to the increase in the number of gallons of gasoline sold  an increase in same store sales from the prior year  and an increase in the average margin on grocery other merchandise sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average margin on prepared food fountain sales 
fiscal discontinued operations resulted in a loss of  net of  income tax benefit compared with a loss of  net of  income tax benefit in fiscal discontinued stores had total revenues of  and  and pretax operating losses of and  for fiscal and  respectively 
included were losses on disposal of  net of tax benefit for the year ended april  and  net of tax benefit for the year ended april  the losses on disposal for the years ended april  and included write downs of stores to net realizable value as well as gains and losses on sales of stores 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to  primarily due to a increase in gas prices and the net addition of corporate stores 
retail gasoline sales for the fiscal year were  an increase of  and gallons sold increased to  inside sales grocery other merchandise and prepared food fountain increased to  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal compared with for the prior year 
the increase was caused by a decrease in the gas margin to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the higher cost of gasoline 
the grocery other merchandise margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the enhancing of the point of sale technology 
the prepared food fountain margin increased to from  primarily due to the relatively low cost of cheese during much of the year and the addition of profitable new products 
operating expenses increased in fiscal  driven by an increase in bank fees resulting from customers greater use of credit cards and higher retail gasoline prices and an increase in the number of corporate stores 
higher gasoline prices decreased the operating expense ratio to of net sales in fiscal from in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due to capital expenditures made in fiscal the effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the valuation of deferred tax assets relating to state income tax depreciation and utilizable net operating losses  which exceeded an increase in the tax contingency reserve 
net earnings from continuing operations increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase in the average margin per gallon of gasoline sold to from the prior year and the increase in average margin on both prepared food fountain and grocery other merchandise sales 
discontinued operations for fiscal resulted in a loss of  net of  income tax benefit compared with a loss of  net of  income tax benefit for fiscal discontinued stores had total revenues of  and  and pretax operating losses of  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
included were losses on disposal of  net of tax benefit for the year ended april  and  net of  tax benefit for the year ended april  the losses on disposal for the years ended april  and included write downs of stores to net realizable value as well as gains and losses on sales of stores

gross profits represent net sales less cost of goods sold 
gross profit is given before charge for depreciation and amortization 
individual store comparisons include only those stores that had been in operation for at least one full year on april of the fiscal year indicated 
retail gasoline profit margins have a substantial impact on our net income 
profit margins on gasoline sales can be adversely affected by factors beyond our control  including oversupply in the retail gasoline market  uncertainty or volatility in the wholesale gasoline market  and price competition from other gasoline marketers 
any substantial decrease in profit margins on retail gasoline sales or the number of gallons sold could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
average operating income represents retail sales less cost of goods sold  including cost of merchandise  financing costs  and operating expenses attributable to a particular store  it excludes federal and state income taxes  company operating expenses not attributable to a particular store  and our payments to the company s benefit plans 
average franchise revenue includes a royalty fee equal to of gross receipts derived from store sales of nongasoline items  a royalty fee of per gallon on gasoline sales  and sign and fa ade rental fees 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective judgments  often because of the need to estimate the effects of inherently uncertain factors 
inventory inventories  which consist of merchandise and gasoline  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for gasoline  cost is determined through the use of the first in  first out fifo method 
for merchandise inventories  cost is determined through the use of the last in  first out lifo method applied to inventory values determined primarily by the fifo method for warehouse inventories and the retail inventory method rim for store inventories  except for cigarettes  beer  pop  and prepared foods  which are valued at cost 
rim is an averaging method widely used in the retail industry because of its practicality 
under rim  inventory valuations are at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to sales 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain management judgments and estimates that could affect the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
vendor allowances include rebates and other funds received from vendors to promote their products 
we often receive such allowances on the basis of quantitative contract terms that vary by product and vendor or directly on the basis of purchases made 
rebates are recognized as reductions of inventory costs when purchases are made  reimbursements of an operating expense eg  advertising are recorded as reductions of the related expense 
long lived assets the company periodically monitors underperforming stores for an indication that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  including goodwill where applicable  an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset 
fair value is based on management s estimate of the amount that could be realized from the sale of assets in a current transaction between willing parties 
the estimate is derived from offers  actual sale or disposition of assets subsequent to year end  and other indications of asset value 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  which for us is generally on a store by store basis 
we had impairment charges of  in fiscal  in fiscal  and  in fiscal self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general liability  and automobile claims 
the self insurance claim liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
actuarial projections of the losses are employed due to the high degree of variability in the liability estimates 
some factors affecting the uncertainty of claims include the development time frame  settlement patterns  litigation and adjudication direction  and medical treatment and cost trends 
the liability is not discounted 
we increased our self insurance reserve by in fiscal and  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business  most sales are for cash  cash from operations is our primary source of liquidity 
we finance our inventory purchases primarily from normal trade credit aided by relatively rapid inventory turnover 
this turnover allows us to conduct operations without large amounts of cash and working capital 
as of april   the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to the ratio at april  and at april  was 
to and 
to  respectively 
we believe our current  bank line of credit together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the working capital needs of our business 
net cash provided by operations decreased  in the year ended april   primarily because of a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventories 
accounts payable decreased primarily because there were only ten days of outstanding gasoline invoices at april  since april  was a sunday  there were twelve days of gasoline invoices outstanding on that date 
inventory increased primarily due to the increase in the cigarette excise taxes  the expanded distribution center capacity  and an increase in the number of corporate stores 
cash used in investing in the year ended april  rose  primarily due to the acquisition of a business 
cash flows from financing increased  primarily because of the proceeds from long term debt 

table of contents capital expenditures represent the single largest use of company funds 
we believe that by reinvesting in corporate stores  we will be better able to respond to competitive challenges and increase operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  we expended  for property and equipment  primarily for the construction  acquisition  and remodeling of corporate stores compared with  in the prior year 
in fiscal  we anticipate expending approximately  primarily from existing cash and funds generated by operations  for construction  acquisition  and remodeling of corporate stores 
as of april   we had long term debt of  consisting of  in principal amount of senior notes  series a and b   in principal amount of senior notes   in principal amount of senior notes  series a through series f  with interest rates ranging from to   in principal amount of senior notes  series a   of mortgage notes payable  and  of capital lease obligations 
interest on the senior notes series a and series b is payable on the th day of each march and september 
principal of the senior notes series a and series b matures in various installments beginning september  we may prepay the senior notes series a and series b in whole or in part at any time in an amount of not less than  at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the note agreement dated september  between the company and the purchasers of the senior notes series a and series b 
interest on the senior notes is payable on the th day of each june and december 
principal of the senior notes matures in semi annual installments beginning december  with the remaining principal payable december  at the rate of per annum 
we may prepay the notes in whole or in part at any time in an amount of not less than  or in integral multiples of in excess thereof at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the note agreement dated december  between the company and the purchaser of the notes 
interest on the to senior notes series a through series f is payable on the rd day of each april and october 
principal of the to senior notes series a through series f matures in various installments beginning april  we may prepay the to senior notes series a through series f in whole or in part at any time in an amount of not less than  or integral multiples of in excess thereof at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the note agreement dated april  between the company and the purchasers of the to senior notes series a through series f 
interest on the series a senior notes is payable semi annually the th day of may and november in each year commencing november  the senior notes mature may  with prepayments of principal commencing on may  and each may thereafter to and including may  the remaining principal is payable at maturity on may  we may at any time prepay the senior notes in whole or in part in an amount not less than  at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the note purchase agreement dated may  between the company and the purchasers of the senior notes 
to date  we have funded capital expenditures primarily from the proceeds of the sale of common stock  issuance of convertible subordinated debentures converted into shares of common stock in  the previously described senior notes  a mortgage note and through funds generated from operations 
future capital required to finance operations  improvements  and the anticipated growth in the number of corporate stores is expected to come from cash generated by operations  the bank line of credit  and additional long term debt or other securities as circumstances may dictate 
we do not expect such capital needs to adversely affect liquidity 
the table below presents our significant contractual obligations  including interest  at april  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years senior notes mortgage notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total 
table of contents included in mortgage notes payable in less than year in the table above is  relating to the purchase of the gas n shop stores that may be paid in future years 
the seller has an option at any time to make an immediate sale of any or all of the stores or to lease any of the stores to us for a period of five years and an option at any time during that five year period to require the company to purchase any leased store and pay the applicable purchase price within forty five days of notice 
the annual lease payments are equal to of the purchase price of the stores leased and are paid monthly during the term of the lease 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the purchase of gas n shop 
at april   we were partially self insured for workers compensation claims in all states of our marketing territory  we also were partially self insured for general liability and auto liability under an agreement that provides for annual stop loss limits equal to or exceeding approximately  to facilitate this agreement  letters of credit approximating  and  were issued and outstanding at april  and  respectively  on the insurance company s behalf 
we renew the letters of credit on an annual basis 
forward looking statements this form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended 
forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including i any statements regarding future sales and gross profit percentages  ii any statements regarding the continuation of historical trends  and iii any statements regarding the sufficiency of the company s cash balances and cash generated from operations and financing activities for the company s future liquidity and capital resource needs 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we caution you that these statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitations the factors described in this form k 
we ask you not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements because they speak only of our views as of the statement dates 
although we have attempted to list the important factors that presently affect the company s business and operating results  we further caution you that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward looking statements  factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statements include  among others  the following competition our business is highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in terms of the numbers and type of retailers offering the products and services found in corporate stores 
many of the food including prepared foods and nonfood items similar or identical to those we sell are generally available from a variety of competitors in the communities served by corporate stores  and we compete with other convenience store chains  gasoline stations  supermarkets  drug stores  discount stores  club stores  mass merchants  and fast food outlets with respect to the sale of prepared foods 
sales of nongasoline items particularly prepared food items have contributed substantially to our gross profit on retail sales in recent years 
gasoline sales are intensely competitive 
we compete for gasoline sales with both independent and national brand gasoline stations  other convenience store chains  and several nontraditional gasoline retailers such as supermarkets in specific markets 
some of these other gasoline retailers may have access to more favorable arrangements for gasoline supply than do we or the firms that supply our stores 
some of our competitors have greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we have and therefore may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry 
gasoline operations gasoline sales are an important part of our revenue and earnings  and retail gasoline profit margins have a substantial impact on our net income 
profit margins on gasoline sales can be affected adversely by factors beyond our control  including the supply of gasoline available in the retail gasoline market  uncertainty or volatility in the wholesale gasoline market  increases in wholesale gasoline costs generally during a period  and price competition from other gasoline marketers 
the market for crude oil and domestic wholesale petroleum products is volatile and is affected by general political conditions and instability in oil producing regions such as the middle east and south america 
the volatility of the wholesale gasoline market makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact of future wholesale cost fluctuation on our operating results and financial conditions 
these factors could materially affect gasoline gallon volume  gasoline gross profit  and overall customer traffic levels at corporate stores 
any substantial decrease in profit margins on gasoline sales or in the number of gallons sold by corporate stores could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 

table of contents the company purchases its gasoline from a variety of independent national and regional petroleum distributors 
although in recent years suppliers have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of gasoline to meet our needs  unanticipated national and international events could result in a reduction of gasoline supplies available for distribution 
any substantial curtailment in our gasoline supply would reduce gasoline sales 
further  we believe a significant amount of our business results from the patronage of customers primarily desiring to purchase gasoline  accordingly  reduced gasoline supplies could adversely affect the sale of nongasoline items 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and operations 
tobacco products sales of tobacco products represent a significant portion of our revenues 
significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products as well as national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the united states could have an adverse effect on the demand for cigarettes sold by corporate stores 
we attempt to pass price increases on to our customers  but competitive pressures in specific markets may prevent us from doing so 
these factors could materially affect the retail price of cigarettes  the volume of cigarettes sold by corporate stores  and overall customer traffic 
environmental compliance costs the united states environmental protection agency and several of the states in which we do business have adopted laws and regulations relating to underground storage tanks used for petroleum products 
in the past  we have incurred substantial costs to comply with such regulations  and additional substantial costs may be necessary in the future 
several states in which we do business have trust fund programs with provisions for sharing or reimbursing corrective action or remediation costs 
any reimbursements received in respect to such costs typically are subject to statutory provisions requiring repayment of the reimbursed funds for any future noncompliance with upgrade provisions or other applicable laws 
although we regularly accrue expenses for the estimated costs related to future corrective action or remediation efforts  there can be no assurance that the accrued amounts will be sufficient to pay such costs or that we have identified all environmental liabilities at all of our current store locations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not incur substantial expenditures in the future for remediation of contamination or related claims that have not been discovered or asserted with respect to existing store locations or locations that we may acquire in the future  that we will not be subject to any claims for reimbursement of funds disbursed to us under the various state programs  and or that additional regulations or amendments to existing regulations will not require additional expenditures beyond those presently anticipated 
seasonality of sales company sales generally are strongest during its first two fiscal quarters may october and weakest during the third and fourth fiscal quarters november april 
in the warmer months  customers tend to purchase greater quantities of gasoline and certain convenience items such as beer  soft drinks  and ice 
difficult weather conditions such as flooding  prolonged rain  or snowstorms in any quarter  however  may adversely reduce sales at affected corporate stores and may have an adverse impact on our earnings for that period 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting our floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of april  would have no material effect on pretax earnings 
we have used a variety of derivative instruments such as options and futures to hedge against the volatility of gasoline cost and are at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments 
it is anticipated that such risk would be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged items 
market risks associated with all of the company s derivative contracts are reviewed regularly by management 
no derivative instruments were used during fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning our prior use of such derivative instruments
