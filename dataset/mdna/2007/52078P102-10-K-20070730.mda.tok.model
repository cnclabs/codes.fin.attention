trademarks lawson and lawson software are registered trademarks in the united states and the european union 
other trademarks and trade names appearing in this document are the property of their respective holders 
intellectual property and product liability we regard certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary  and rely on a combination of contract  copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures  including confidentiality agreements  to protect our proprietary information 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry  trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements  and the timeliness and quality of support services 
we cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate  or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
historically  we have provided our customers source code for many of our products 
we may elect to distribute only object code in the future 
in either case  we will permit clients to obtain access to our other source code through a source code escrow arrangement 
access to our source code delivered in object format may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our software products are  or may be licensed  do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and sweden 
software companies have increasingly applied for  and relied on  the protection of patents 
to date  we hold one united states patent and have filed several patent applications 
these applications may not result in issued patents and  even if issued will not provide assurance of a competitive advantage 
we do not believe our software products  third party software products we offer under sublicense agreements  our trademarks  or other lawson proprietary rights infringe the property rights of third parties 
however  we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
our license agreements with our clients contain provisions designed to limit the exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in these license agreements may not be valid as a result of certain local country laws or unfavorable judicial decisions 
employees as of may   we had approximately  employees  including approximately in sales and marketing  approximately in research and development  approximately  in services and customer support and approximately in administration 
none of our employees in the united states is represented by a labor union  however  in certain international subsidiaries workers councils represent our employees

risk factors factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks 
investors evaluating our company and its business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this report on form k 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report on form k 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may make forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements based on circumstances or events which occur in the future 
the actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report on form k 
the enterprise software business is highly competitive 
we compete with oracle corporation  sap ag  infor global solutions gmbh  microsoft corporation  mckesson corporation and other larger software companies that have advantages over us due to their larger customer bases  greater name recognition  long operating and product development history  greater international presence and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
if customers or prospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors  they may elect to purchase competing products from oracle  sap  infor or microsoft since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products 
furthermore  oracle is capable of bundling its software with its database applications  which underlie a significant portion of our installed applications 
we also compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors  including single industry software vendors  human resource management software vendors  financial management software vendors  manufacturing software vendors  merchandising software vendors  services automation software vendors  software integrators and outsourced services providers  and internet on demand software vendors 
we believe that oracle  sap and other competitors are discounting their products and services on an increasing basis to attempt to gain market share in the markets where we compete 
some competitors are also increasingly aggressive with offering payment terms  contractual warranties  implementation terms or guarantees that are more favorable to customers and prospects 
competitors may entice our customers and prospects to switch software vendors by offering those customers or prospects free or heavily discounted products or services  and other more favorable contract terms 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers that lower our margins and increase our risks 
we expect competition to persist and intensify  which could negatively impact our operating results and market share 
our revenues  and in particular our software license revenue  vary each quarter and are difficult to predict 
revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our licensing activity with new and existing customers  and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter under our revenue recognition policies 
if we do not continue to develop or acquire new products  licensing activity with existing customers will decline 
licensing activity for our products drives maintenance and services revenues because we sell maintenance and services for only our products 
a decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenue in the same or subsequent quarters 
if we do not have sufficient licensing activity with new customers each year  our maintenance revenue for the following year will decline because new customers are needed to offset the percentage of existing customers who scale back their businesses  reduce licenses and maintenance contracts  are acquired  or otherwise choose not to renew annual maintenance 
our sales force and marketing team must continue to generate sales leads among existing customers and prospective customers 
when we qualify a lead  that lead becomes part of our sales pipeline 
if our pipeline does not continue to grow in our different markets and geographies  our revenues will eventually decline 
the rate at which we convert our pipeline into actual sales can vary greatly from year to year for the following reasons the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary and can be more than one year 
during the sales cycle  prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down purchases because of competing offers  budgetary constraints or changes in the prospect s management  strategy  business or industry 
increasingly  customer or prospect organizations are taking more steps to approve the purchase of our products and services 
often times  we must wait for a customer or prospect s board of directors to approve a purchase 
these added approval requirements can delay the sales cycle and jeopardize the likelihood of completing the sale 
a substantial number of our existing and prospective customers make their purchase decision within the last few weeks or days of each quarter 
a delay or deferral in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause our quarterly license revenue to fall significantly short of our predictions 
prospective customers may decline or defer the purchase of new products if we do not have sufficient customer references for those products 
new products or technologies  software industry mergers and other software industry news may create uncertainty and cause customers and prospective customers to cancel  postpone or reduce capital spending for our products 
because a substantial portion of our software license revenue contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter  and our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term  unexpected revenue shortfalls and deferrals have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability 
we have experienced fluctuations in our profit margin for consulting services and may not be able to achieve our profit margin goals 
for fiscal  consulting services represented of our total revenues 
since our acquisition of intentia in april  we have taken measures to improve our profit margin for consulting services  including improving utilization of services personnel and moving portions of our consulting services to our lower cost operations in manila 
while we have experienced margin improvements in most quarters during fiscal  our margins declined to in the fourth quarter of fiscal several factors led to this decline including high demand for consulting services that was addressed through outsourcing a portion of our consulting services to third parties which had the effect of lowering the consulting services margin 
since the consulting services business is highly sensitive to customer demands and other external and internal forces  the margin improvement actions taken by us can be reduced within certain periods of time 
we must attract and retain account executives in our sales organization to achieve our revenue goals 
revenue growth  and in particular software license revenue growth  requires that we have a sufficient number of trained account executives in our sales organization to develop leads and call on prospective customers 
competition in our industry for experienced account executives is intense 
competitors and other software companies may lure away our account executives through signing bonuses and other special incentives 
the failure to attract and retain account executives will negatively impact our revenue growth 
when we hire a new account executive  the time period required for that person to become productive will vary  depending on their experience and training and the customer pipeline and length of sales cycle 
if we are unable to attract and retain senior management  software developers  services consultants  finance and accounting specialists  and other qualified personnel  we will be unable to develop new products and increase our revenue and profitability 
we also rely on the continued service of our senior management  software developers  services consultants  finance and accounting specialists  and other key employees 
in the software industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical  financial and other personnel 
the failure to attract  train  retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service 
if we are unable to attract and retain finance and accounting personnel who have experience with the software industry and united states accounting requirements  we will have to continue to rely on more costly contractors to fill the roles necessary for us to meet our governance and regulatory requirements 
economic  political and market conditions  can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for enterprise software and related maintenance and services  particularly in the industries and geographies in which we sell our products and services 
demand for enterprise software and demand for our solutions are affected by general economic conditions  competition  product acceptance and technology lifecycles 
regional and global changes in the economy  governmental budget deficits and political instability in certain geographic areas have resulted in businesses  government agencies and educational institutions reducing their spending for technology projects generally and delaying or reconsidering potential purchases of our products and related services 
the uncertainty posed by the long term effects of the war in the middle east  terrorist activities  potential pandemics  natural disasters and related uncertainties and risks and other geopolitical issues may impact the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers 
because of these factors  we believe the level of demand for our products and services  and projections of future revenue and operating results  will continue to be difficult to predict 
these geopolitical risks could also impede employee travel and our business operations in any affected regions 
we are required to delay revenue recognition into future periods for portions of our license fee activity 
our entire worldwide business is subject to united states generally accepted accounting principles  commonly referred to as us gaap 
under those rules  we are required to defer revenue recognition for license fees in situations that include the following the customer agreement includes products that are under development or has other undelivered elements  the customer agreement includes essential services  including significant modifications  customization or complex interfaces  this is more prevalent with our m products  the customer agreement includes acceptance criteria  the customer agreement includes extended or contingent payment terms or fees  a third party vendor  whose technology is incorporated into our products  delays delivery of its product to the customer  the customer agreement includes a fixed fee service arrangement for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  or we are not able to establish historical pricing and maintenance renewal rates to meet the vsoe requirements of these accounting rules 
we expect that we will continue to defer portions of our license fee activity because of these factors  with deferrals more likely for a our m products because of product customization often required due to the nature of the manufacturing and distribution industries that is frequently included with new sales  b sales to governmental entities because those often include fixed fee arrangements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value and c sales of large license fee contracts because it is more difficult to use standard contract terms 
the amount of license fees deferred may be significant and will vary each quarter  depending on the mix of products sold in each market and geography  and the actual contract terms 
we may take additional restructuring actions that result in financial charges in the period taken 
since the closing of our acquisition of intentia in april  we have been integrating our two companies and executing on our business plan 
before the acquisition  lawson focused primarily on targeted service industries in north america  with our s products  and intentia focused primarily on manufacturing and distribution industries in europe  with its m products 
we have consolidated lawson and intentia facilities and taken other restructuring actions to reduce combined company costs 
we are also continuing to expand our operations in the philippines  and reduce certain higher cost employee positions in the united states and europe 
if we decide to take additional restructuring actions to improve operational efficiencies  we may be required to incur financial charges in the period when we make that decision  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 
charges to earnings resulting from past acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results 
under purchase accounting  we allocate the total purchase price to an acquired company s net tangible assets  intangible assets and in process research and development based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain 
going forward  the following factors could result in material charges that would adversely affect our results impairment of goodwill or intangible assets  identification of assumed contingent liabilities subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  and charges to income to eliminate certain lawson pre merger activities that duplicate those of the acquired company or to reduce our cost structure 
we may not retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products 
the enterprise software market is faced with rapid technological change  evolving standards in computer hardware  software development and communications infrastructure  and changing needs and expectations of customers 
building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in development 
a substantial portion of our research and development resources are devoted to regulatory and maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support 
these demands put significant constraints on our resources available for new product development 
we also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products 
business disruptions may interfere with our ability to conduct business 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in the event of a security breach  major fire  earthquake  war  terrorist attack  pandemic or other catastrophic event 
travel restrictions or impaired access or significant damage to our data center due to such an event could cause a disruption of business  which could adversely impact results of operations and financial conditions 
deterioration in our relationships with resellers  systems integrators and other third parties that market and sell our products could reduce our revenues 
our revenue growth will depend  in part  on adding new partners to expand our sales channels  as well as leveraging our relationships with existing partners 
if our relationships with these resellers  system integrators and strategic and technology partners deteriorate or terminate  we may lose sales and marketing opportunities 
some current and potential customers rely on third party systems integrators to implement and manage new and existing applications 
these systems integrators may increase their promotion of competing enterprise software applications  or may otherwise discontinue their relationships with us 
we also license third party software products that we incorporate into  or resell with  our own software products 
for example  we incorporate micro focus international  inc s software in many of our products and have reseller and alliance relationships with ibm  business software incorporated  business objects  hyperion solutions corporation and other businesses that allow us to resell their offerings with our products and services 
these relationships and other technology licenses are subject to periodic renewal and may include minimum sales requirements 
a failure to renew or early termination of these relationships or other technology licenses could adversely impact our business 
we currently have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of before we acquired intentia in april  intentia as a swedish company was not required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of concerning the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
consequently  intentia did not have the staff  experience  training or procedures to comply with sarbanes oxley 
during the first quarter ended august   we identified that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting exists relating to the lack of a sufficient number of qualified accounting personnel with the required proficiency to apply the company s accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america us gaap 
although we have intensified our hiring efforts for qualified accounting personnel  this material weakness has not been remediated as of may  the existence of an internal control deficiency which has been assessed as a material weakness can increase the risk that the consolidated financial statements included in this report and other periodic reports do not fairly present  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 
as a result of the existence of this material weakness  we could encounter delays in our ability to complete our financial reporting on a timely basis and lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting which  in turn  could have a negative market reaction 
if in the future we acquire other companies that are not subject to sarbanes oxley  we could face similar risks relating to the integration of the acquired companies and our compliance with sarbanes oxley 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 
as a multinational organization  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the united states as well as in various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  both in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes and may have additional exposure to additional non income tax liabilities 
our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
we have had an unusually high effective tax rate and are taking steps to bring our effective tax rate more in line with our industry 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful because our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates  changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes  unanticipated changes in tax rates  changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock based compensation  the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  changes to the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  or the assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
periodically  we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority  and we regularly engage in discussions  and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature from time to time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
international sales and operations subject us to risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  and have significant operations  outside of the united states 
our international operations include software development  sales  customer support and administration 
we face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries  which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  overlapping tax regimes  difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
we must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations  including trade restrictions  local labor ordinances  and import and export requirements 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  swedish krona and british pound relative to the united states dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results 
recognized balance sheet exposures are partially offset by forward currency contracts 
net foreign currency transaction gains and losses  resulting primarily from recognized balance sheet exposures  are recorded within earnings in the period incurred 
our products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects or security flaws 
because our products are deployed in large and complex systems  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our software programs may contain undetected defects when first introduced or as new versions are released  and our customers may discover defects in our products  experience corruption of their data or encounter performance or scaling problems only after our software programs have been deployed 
as a consequence  from time to time we have received customer complaints following installation of our products 
we are currently a defendant in several lawsuits where customers have raised these types of issues with our products and services 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
software and data security are becoming increasingly important because of regulatory restrictions on data privacy and the significant legal exposures and business disruptions stemming from computer viruses and other unauthorized entry or use of computer systems 
we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance  software security or the provision of services 
product defects and security flaws could expose us to product liability and warranty claims and harm our reputation  which could impact our future sales of products and services 
competitors may take advantage of our limited intellectual property protection 
we consider certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation to be proprietary  and rely on a combination of contract  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect this information 
in addition  we currently hold one patent in the united states and have filed several patent applications 
outstanding applications may not result in issued patents and  even if issued  the patents may not provide any competitive advantage 
copyright laws afford only limited protection because those laws do not protect product ideas 
in addition  when we license our products to customers  we provide source code for many of our products 
customers may also access source code through a source code escrow arrangement 
access to our source code could provide an opportunity for companies to offer competing maintenance and product modification services to our customers 
defending our intellectual property rights is time consuming and costly 
others may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
many participants in the technology industry have an increasing number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to take legal action based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
these types of claims are time consuming and costly to defend 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and industry throughout the world 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and the risk of litigation by employees  customers  suppliers  stockholders or others through private actions  class actions  administrative proceedings or other litigation 
subsequent to our acquisition of intentia in april  we have been working with various intentia customers to resolve litigation and disputes that arose before the acquisition 
litigation can be lengthy  expensive  and disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted with certainty 
there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 
as a result  litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  and any acquisitions and investments we do complete may create business difficulties or dilute earnings 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates 
even if we identify suitable candidates  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
if we acquire a company  we may incur losses in the operations of that company and we may have difficulty integrating its products  personnel and operations into our business 
in addition  its key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these difficulties could disrupt our on going business  distract our management and workforce  increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
we may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
furthermore  we may incur significant debt to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments 
the issuance of equity securities may be dilutive to our stockholders 
if the products of an acquired company are not successful  those remaining assets could become impaired  which may result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
open source software may diminish our license fees and impair the ownership of our products 
the open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use  distribution and modification  often free of charge 
open source software  such as the linux operating system  has been gaining in popularity among business users 
if developers contribute enterprise application software to the open source community  and that software has competitive features and scale to business users in our markets  we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete 
if one of our developers embedded open source components into one of our products  without our knowledge or authorization  our ownership and licensing of that product could be in jeopardy 
depending on the open source license terms  the use of an open source component could mean that all products delivered with that open source component become part of the open source community 
in that case  we would not own those delivered products and could not charge license fees for those products 
we currently take steps to train our developers and monitor the content of products in development  but there is no assurance that these steps will always be effective 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of lawson or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our stockholder rights plan and under delaware law could make it more difficult for other businesses to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions  among others  which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings  a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  and the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote 
the issuance of stock under our stockholder rights plan could delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met  such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
control by existing shareholders could significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of may   our executive officers  directors  and affiliated entities  in the aggregate  beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock 
hedge fund investors have accumulated large positions in our stock 
groups of the stockholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
sale of a portion of these shares in the public market  or the perception that such sales are likely to occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
our stock price could become more volatile and our stock could decline in value 
all of the factors discussed above could affect our stock price  as well as speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in analysts valuation measures for our stock  and market trends 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
proposed accounting rule changes for certain convertible debt instruments could alter trends established in previous periods on july  the fasb approved a proposal that would alter the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements 
if adopted  this proposal could significantly increase the non cash interest expense associated with our existing million convertible debt  including interest expense in prior periods as a result of the proposed retrospective accounting treatment 
the exact impact of this proposal to the company s financial statements will not be known for some time  but the company will monitor the developments of this proposal and will comply with any new requirements 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our corporate headquarters and executive offices are in st 
paul  minnesota  usa where we lease approximately  square feet of space 
the lease on this facility expires july  we also lease approximately  square feet of space  primarily for regional sales and support offices  elsewhere in the united states 
additionally  lawson through its international headquarters in stockholm  sweden  leases approximately  square feet of office space in approximately countries used primarily as sales and services offices

s solutions consist of legacy lawson software applications and m solutions consist of applications historically licensed by intentia international ab that are geared for manufacturing  distribution and trade businesses who face resource constraints and whose processes are often complex and industry specific 
acquisitions the company s acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisitions and the results of operations have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition dates 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions is subject to an annual impairment test and is not amortized 
these acquisitions are intended to enhance our focus on targeted vertical markets and to provide additional value added products and services to our clients 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of intentia 
we believe that the combination provides opportunities to leverage sales channels and sell expanded product lines across the combined business customer base 
the acquisition was accomplished through lawson s offer to exchange intentia s shares and warrants for newly issued shares of lawson common stock 
we also completed a reorganization in connection with the combination 
see note business combinations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding equity of competency assessment solutions for million in cash 
the acquisition was completed to augment the company s human capital management solutions 
a final contingent payment of million in cash was made on december  in the allocation of the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets which included acquired technology and a non compete agreement 
these amounts and the net liabilities assumed of million equal the total purchase price of million 
on december   we entered into a purchase agreement with sigma enterprise applications ab sigma whereby lawson acquired from sigma for approximately million in cash  million of assumed liabilities and a contingent additional payment of up to million  sigma s business pertaining to the maintenance and servicing of the lawson s products 
the acquisition was completed to augment sales of s products in the nordic region 
the allocation of the purchase price of million along with transaction costs of million was allocated as follows million to existing technology  to be amortized over a five year period  and million to a non compete agreement  to be amortized over a three year period 
outlook as we enter our second year after the merger  we anticipate that many of the initiatives undertaken by lawson in fiscal will provide revenue growth and margin expansion 
during fiscal  we grew our sales force by approximately and enhanced our services capacity through headcount growth in the markets served by lawson and in our solutions center in manila 
with these investments  we expect our overall fiscal total revenue to grow between and over fiscal total revenue 
by expanding our manila resources  we not only increased our services capacity  but we will also increase our capacity in other areas such as our research and development and general and administrative areas 
while much of this investment in research and development and general and administrative areas will continue throughout fiscal  we expect our overall expenses  including cost of revenues to marginally increase over fiscal overall  we expect to improve our gross and operating margins and improve our eps in fiscal our fiscal eps is currently expected to fall between and per share 
updates to these estimates  to the extent there are any updates  are made through our quarterly earnings release announcements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debt  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software businesses are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to year 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectibility can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which typically include license fees  maintenance and support fees and consulting service fees 
these multiple element arrangements must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and in accordance with the sec accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide related consulting services  including training  and implementation services  as well as on going customer support and maintenance 
when our consulting  training and implementation services are not considered essential to the functionality of our software products  are sold separately and also are available from a number of third party service providers  our revenues from these services are generally recorded separately from license fees and recognized as the services are performed 
license fees within software arrangements including services that do not meet any one or a combination of the three criteria listed above  are recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  using contract accounting and the percentage of completion methodology based on labor hours input 
software arrangements which include certain fixed fee service components are usually recognized as the services are performed while corresponding costs to provide these services are expensed as incurred 
the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements may vary  due to the amount of judgment required to address significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties in applying the application of the percentage of completion methodology 
our specific revenue recognition policies are as follows software license fees license fee revenues from end users are recognized when the software product has been shipped  provided a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
provided the above criteria are met  license fee revenues from resellers are recognized when there is a sell through by a reseller to an end user 
a sell through is determined when we receive an order form from a reseller for a specific end user sale 
we do not generally offer rights of return  acceptance clauses or price protection to our customers 
in situations where software license contracts include rights of return or acceptance clauses  revenue is deferred until the clause expires 
typically  our software license fees are due within a month period from the date of shipment 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  or includes payment terms greater than twelve months from shipment  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple delivered elements such as software products or specified upgrades and undelivered elements such as support or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee according to the fair value of each element using vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
in software arrangements in which we have fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element and is recognized as revenue 
in software arrangements in which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until fair value is determined or all elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  have been delivered 
maintenance and support revenues from customer maintenance and support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
revenues for maintenance and support that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the bundled maintenance and support and recognized over the term of the agreement 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the renewal rate for continued maintenance and support arrangements 
consulting services revenues from consulting services including training and implementation services are recognized as services are provided to customers 
revenues for consulting services that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the bundled services and recognized when the services are performed 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when training and consulting services are sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary in the period such determination has been made  affecting future results of operations 
sales returns and allowances 
although we do not generally provide a contractual right of return  in the course of arriving at practical business solutions to various warranty and other claims  we have allowed sales returns and allowances 
we record a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on licenses in the same period the related revenues are recorded or when current information indicates additional amounts are required 
these estimates are based on historical experience determined by analysis of return activities  specifically identified customers and other known factors 
if the historical data we utilize does not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowances would be necessary in the period such determination has been made  affecting future results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
substantially all of our intangible assets and goodwill resulted from our april acquisition of intentia 
we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent to or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the long lived asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the asset is considered impaired  and the impairment is measured by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value using the discounted cash flows method 
the discount rate utilized is based on management s best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare our carrying amount to market value 
market value is determined utilizing our market capitalization plus a control premium 
if our market value exceeds our carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our carrying amount exceeds our market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is the new accounting basis 
a subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed and the loss has been recognized 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal  state  and foreign income taxes 
the company operates in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside of the united states 
accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable rates 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the amounts provided in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
in conjunction with preparing the global tax provision  we must assess temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of specific items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of this process  we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including historical operating results  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  except as discussed below for pre acquisition deferred tax assets that had a pre acquisition valuation allowance  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related interpretations  future period reductions to the valuation allowance related to intentia s deferred tax assets that existed as of the date of the acquisition of intentia are first credited against goodwill  then to the other identifiable assets existing at the date of acquisition  and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited to the income tax provision 
a provision benefit will not be realized for amounts credited against goodwill and other identifiable assets 
contingencies 
the company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
the company accrues for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and able to be estimated in accordance with no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas litigation reserves 
the establishment of litigation reserves requires judgments concerning the ultimate outcome of pending litigation against the company and its subsidiaries 
reserves established in the normal course of business are based on the application of sfas  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an adverse outcome is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimation of the probable loss 
reserves established in purchase accounting are based on fair value under sfas no 
 business combinations sfas so long as fair value can be determined within the purchase allocation period  otherwise these are determined under sfas all reserves exclude legal costs which are treated as a period expense as incurred 
in applying judgment  management utilizes  among other things  opinions and estimates obtained from internal and outside legal counsel 
for purposes of assessing purchase accounting information  management also utilizes information obtained from independent valuation experts 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss and then quantifying the amount of loss for purposes of adjusting initial estimates requires the exercise of considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new matters  developments in existing matters or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to the resolution of any particular matter 
equity based compensation 
effective june   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and superseded accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under sfas r  stock based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all new awards granted after june  and unvested awards outstanding at june  compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are outstanding at june   will be recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the pro forma disclosures under sfas  using a straight line method 
the company elected the modified prospective method of adopting sfas r  under which prior periods are not retroactively restated 
stock based compensation expense for non vested awards granted prior to the effective date is being recognized over the remaining service period using the fair value based compensation cost estimated for sfas pro forma disclosures 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of equity based compensation and  consequently  the related expense recognized 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of stock based compensation

while the businesses have begun to integrate  and separate identification is becoming increasingly difficult between legacy lawson and intentia data  we have provided these separate metrics in the areas where we could reasonably calculate an impact 
all references to the effect of the distinction between legacy lawson and intentia are therefore approximate 
although we operate as one business segment  due to the size of the intentia acquisition on lawson s historical operations  we believe this distinction  while not exact  provides relevant insight into the changes in results of operations 
revenues year ended may  vs

dollars percent dollars percent in thousands  except revenues license fees maintenance consulting total revenues total revenues 
we generate revenues from licensing software  providing maintenance for previously licensed products and providing consulting services 
we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  maintenance and consulting services are sold to our customers 
because our maintenance and consulting services are primarily attributable to our licensed products  growth in our maintenance and consulting services is directly tied to the success of our license contracting activity 
the growth in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to the addition of the intentia business 
a total of million or of this increase was attributable to the intentia revenue streams and the remaining million or was attributable to growth in the legacy lawson revenue streams 
our total revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal of which was attributable to intentia s five week total revenues 
excluding intentia s five week total revenues  we experienced increases in license fees and maintenance 
consulting revenue increased in fiscal over fiscal slightly as well 
license fees 
our license fees primarily consist of fees resulting from products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees result from a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s licensing of additional users for previously licensed products 
license fees increased million or in fiscal over fiscal of which million or related to intentia s revenues 
intentia s increase related to fiscal having included an entire year of license revenue as compared to fiscal which included only five weeks 
excluding intentia s license revenues  license fees for legacy lawson slightly decreased by million or in fiscal as compared to total license revenues 
in fiscal  deals greater than million decreased to seven from ten in fiscal  which led to lower contracted license amounts  which in turn has led to lower license fee revenue 
an increase in the amount of deferred revenue  including the full deferral of certain contracts  also attributed to the lower license fee revenue for s products 
the number of licensing transactions with new clients decreased to in the current year period down from in the prior year 
despite the slight decrease in license fee revenue  from a product perspective  lawson system foundation product line had a growth of approximately million 
license fees increased in fiscal over fiscal of which related to intentia s five week license revenues 
excluding intentia s five weeks license revenues  license fees increased in fiscal which represented a rebound from the decline experienced in fiscal license fees were particularly stronger within our retail and industry market customers in fiscal as compared to fiscal from a product perspective  license fees for our human resources  financials and budgeting and planning product lines represented the largest portion of growth over fiscal the number of licensing transactions with new clients increased to in the current year period up from in the prior year 
the increase in new client sales is due in part because of a return to traditional buying patterns that were slowed in fiscal due to industry consolidation 
additionally  many of our targeted public company clients completed their initial year of sarbanes oxley compliance in fiscal  which freed up their time and resources to facilitate some of the increase during fiscal sales activity 
license fee revenue as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
maintenance 
our maintenance revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll and renew licensed products in our maintenance program 
this program entitles our customers to product enhancements  technical support services  and on going compatibility with third party operating systems  databases and hardware 
these fees are typically charged annually and are based on the license fees initially paid by the customer 
maintenance revenues can have fluctuations based on the timing of contracts  renewal rates  price increases and the number of new license contracts 
maintenance revenue increased by million or for fiscal due mostly to maintenance revenue of million or added with the purchase of intentia that was not included within our maintenance revenue in fiscal maintenance revenues for the m product line from intentia continued to be adversely impacted by the fair value purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the acquisition 
this fair value purchase accounting adjustment had the expected effect of lowering the maintenance revenue from m maintenance services by million or for fiscal the remaining million or of the total increase is due to our legacy lawson maintenance revenue increases 
the higher maintenance revenue was influenced by an increase in renewal rates from in to in price increases and maintenance agreements associated with new customers also contributed to the higher maintenance revenue 
in fiscal  our maintenance revenues increased by over fiscal of this increase  was attributable to intentia s five weeks of maintenance revenues included within our fiscal maintenance revenues 
without the addition of intentia s maintenance revenues in fiscal  annual price increases to renewals along with the addition of new customers in fiscal led to the increase over fiscal the maintenance revenues for intentia in fiscal were generated primarily from the deferred maintenance revenue balance acquired in april accordingly  the revenues recorded during this period also reflect the pro rata portion of the fair value purchase accounting reductions made to the deferred maintenance balance acquired in april the impact of the fair value purchase accounting adjustments to maintenance revenues relating to the deferred balances acquired in april resulted in a reduction in deferred revenue and largely impacted the first months after the acquisition date

our consulting revenues consist of services related to software installations  software implementations  customized development  and training services to customers who have licensed our products 
consulting revenue for fiscal almost tripled with an increase of million or from fiscal intentia has historically experienced higher consulting revenues when compared to lawson s traditional consulting revenues 
in fiscal  the consulting revenue derived from m consultants was million or of total consulting revenues and of the total increase over the fair value purchase accounting adjustment associated with the intentia acquisition had the effect of lowering the expected consulting revenue by million or for fiscal in fiscal  excluding the impact of m consulting  the remaining million or increase pertained to consulting revenue from legacy lawson 
a improvement in utilization of resources resulted in increased consulting revenue 
revenue provided by third parties as a result of service opportunities exceeding the current capacity of lawson consultants  also contributed to the increase in consulting revenue 
consulting revenues increased by in fiscal over fiscal levels 
of this increase  resulted from the addition of intentia s five weeks of consulting revenue 
increased contracting activity in lead to increases in our consulting revenue towards the end of the fiscal year 
much of this increase resulted from an increase in third party consulting services 
lawson s consulting revenues in fiscal were partially generated from the deferred consulting revenue balance acquired from intentia in april accordingly  some of the consulting revenue amounts recorded during this period also reflect fair value purchase accounting reductions made to the deferred consulting balance acquired in april consulting revenue as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal  and was  and  respectively

in addition  we resell third party products in conjunction with the license of our software solutions  which also results in a fee 
the cost of license fees is higher when we resell products of third party vendors 
as a result  gross margins will vary depending on the proportion of third party product sales in our revenue mix 
cost of license fees increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in cost of license resulted primarily from the addition of million or of expenses from intentia which included million or of amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition

the increase in net cash provided by working capital  excluding the impact of the intentia acquired working capital balances  was primarily driven by a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and an million increase in deferred revenue and customer deposits 
the million decrease in cash received from accounts receivable was primarily due to a million reduction of intentia receivable that was partially offset by an increase in legacy lawson receivable resulting from strong fourth quarter sales 
the million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets is largely due to the collection of an income tax refund

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
the company s market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of the fiscal year ended may  approximately of our revenue was denominated in a foreign currency 
we manage foreign currency market risk  from time to time  using forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are expected to be offset by gains or losses on forward contracts 
this is expected to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction gains or losses in future periods 
for the fiscal year ended may   our foreign currency exposures were primarily related to non functional currency intercompany loans and advances to from our international subsidiaries 
as of july   we changed the operating structure of our european subsidiaries whereby we expect our non functional currency exposure to increase significantly for other balance sheet accounts  particularly accounts receivable  accounts payable and certain accrual accounts 
we  therefore  expect the volume of our hedging activities to increase 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency forward contracts generally are short term in nature and mature within days or less 
we mark to market all contracts at the end of the period and unrealized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations for that period 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses related to forward contracts recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as of may  was million 
at may  the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that were in a gain position totaled million and the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that were in a loss position totaled million

as of may   the average maturity of our investment securities was less than three months and all investment securities had maturities less than months 
as of may   we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of fair values 
changes in the market interest rates will not have a material impact on our financial position 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our senior convertible notes due april  the fair value of our convertible senior notes may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates
