item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
we commenced principal operations in late  and since that time we have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  development of our manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
we do not currently have any commercial products 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we will need to address a number of technological and clinical challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of funds that we will require  or the length of time that will pass  before we receive significant revenues from sales of any of our products  if ever 
our most advanced product candidate and likeliest source of product revenue is methynaltrexone 
in december  we entered into a license and co development agreement the collaboration agreement with wyeth pharmaceuticals wyeth to develop and commercialize methylnaltrexone 
see collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals  below 
our work with methylnaltrexone has proceeded farthest as a treatment for opioid induced constipation 
constipation is a serious medical problem for patients who are being treated with opioid medications 
methylnaltrexone is designed to reverse the side effects of opioid medications while maintaining pain relief  an important need not currently met by any approved drugs 
we have successfully completed two pivotal phase clinical trials of the subcutaneous form of methylnaltrexone in patients receiving palliative care  including cancer  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids and heart disease 
we achieved positive results from our two pivotal phase clinical trials studies and 
all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of both of the phase studies were met and were statistically significant 
the drug was generally well tolerated in both phase trials 
we now expect to submit a new drug application to the us food and drug administration fda in march for subcutaneous methylnaltrexone 
we are also developing an intravenous form of methylnaltrexone in collaboration with wyeth for the management of post operative ileus  a serious condition of the gastrointestinal tract 
we and wyeth have initiated two global pivotal phase clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous methylnaltrexone for the treatment of post operative ileus 
under the collaboration agreement  wyeth is also developing oral methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic pain 
prior to the collaboration agreement  we had completed phase clinical trials of oral methylnaltrexone in healthy volunteers  which indicated that methylnaltrexone was well tolerated 
wyeth has also conducted certain additional phase clinical trials of oral methylnaltrexone and in august initiated a phase clinical trial to evaluate once daily dosing of oral methylnaltrexone 
preliminary results from the phase trial  conducted by wyeth  showed that the initial formulation of oral methylnaltrexone was generally well tolerated but did not exhibit sufficient clinical activity to advance into phase testing 
wyeth is beginning clinical testing in march of a new formulation of oral methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid induced constipation 
in the area of virology  we are developing viral entry inhibitors  which are molecules designed to inhibit the virus ability to enter certain types of immune system cells 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv is the virus that causes aids 
receptors and co receptors are structures on the surface of a cell to which a virus must bind in order to infect the cell 
in mid  we announced positive phase clinical findings related to pro  a monoclonal antibody designed to target the hiv co receptor ccr  in healthy volunteers 
a phase b trial of pro in hiv infected patients began in december and completed enrollment and dosing in december we are also conducting research into a therapeutic for hepatitis c virus infection that blocks viral entry into cells 
in addition  we are developing immunotherapies for prostate cancer  including monoclonal antibodies directed against prostate specific membrane antigen psma  a protein found on the surface of prostate cancer cells 
we are also developing vaccines designed to stimulate an immune response to psma 
prior to april   our psma programs were conducted with cytogen corporation cytogen collectively  the members through psma development company llc  our former joint venture with cytogen psma llc  which became our wholly owned subsidiary on that date 
see psma development company llc  below 
we are also studying a cancer vaccine  gmk  in phase clinical trials for the treatment of malignant melanoma and we are engaged in a research program to discover treatments for hepatitis c that block viral entry into cells 

table of contents our sources of revenues through december  have been payments under our current and former collaboration agreements  from psma llc  from research grants and contracts related to our cancer and hiv programs and from interest income 
beginning in january  we are recognizing revenues from wyeth for reimbursement of our development expenses for methylnaltrexone as incurred  for the million upfront payment we received from wyeth over the period of our development obligations and for any milestones or contingent events that are achieved during our collaboration with wyeth 
in addition  we did not recognize revenue from psma llc during prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc since the members did not approve a work plan and budget for and since then  psma llc has become our wholly owned subsidiary 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly as our programs progress and we make filings with regulators for approval to market our product candidates 
our development and commercialization expenses for methylnaltrexone are being funded by wyeth  which allows us to devote our current and future resources to our other research and development programs 
we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of million 
during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of million from three public offerings totaling  shares of our common stock 
we also received an upfront payment of million from wyeth in connection with signing the license and co development agreement 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
we expect that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels beyond one year 
during the year ended december   we had a net loss of million and cash used in operating activities was million 
other than potential revenues from methylnaltrexone  we do not anticipate generating significant recurring revenues  from product sales or otherwise  in the near term  and we expect our expenses to increase 
consequently  we may require significant additional external funding to continue our operations at their current levels in the future 
such funding may be derived from additional collaboration or licensing agreements with pharmaceutical or other companies or from the sale of our common stock or other securities to investors 
however  such additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals we and wyeth entered into the collaboration agreement on december  for the development and commercialization of methylnaltrexone 
under the collaboration agreement wyeth paid to us a million non refundable upfront payment  for which we deferred the recognition of revenue at december  since work under the collaboration agreement did not commence until january wyeth is obligated to make up to million in additional payments to us upon the achievement of milestones and contingent events in the development and commercialization of methylnaltrexone 
all costs for the development of methylnaltrexone incurred by wyeth or us starting january  are being paid by wyeth 
we are being reimbursed for our out of pocket development costs by wyeth and will receive reimbursement for our efforts based on the number of our full time equivalent employees fte s devoted to the development project 
wyeth is obligated to pay to us royalties on the sale by wyeth of methylnaltrexone throughout the world during the applicable royalty periods 
in january  we began recognizing revenue from wyeth for reimbursement of our development expenses for methylnaltrexone as incurred during each quarter under the development plan agreed to by us and wyeth 
we also began recognizing revenue for a portion of the million upfront payment we received from wyeth  based on the proportion of the expected total effort for us to complete our development obligations that was actually performed during that quarter 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue from the million upfront payment received in december and million as reimbursement for our out of pocket development costs  including our labor costs 
in october  we earned a million milestone payment in connection with the start of the first of two global pivotal phase clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous methylnaltrexone for the treatment of post operative ileus  which was recognized as revenue under the substantive milestone method see critical accounting policies revenue recognition  below 
the collaboration agreement establishes a joint steering committee jsc and a joint development committee jdc  each with an equal number of representatives of both wyeth and us 
the joint steering committee is responsible for coordinating the key activities of wyeth and us under the collaboration agreement

in addition  a joint commercialization committee jcc was established  composed of representatives of both wyeth and us in number and function according to each of our responsibilities 
the jcc is responsible for facilitating open communication between wyeth and us on matters relating to the commercialization of products 

table of contents the collaboration agreement involves the development and commercialization of three products i a subcutaneous form of methylnaltrexone  to be used in patients with opioid induced constipation  ii an intravenous form of methylnaltrexone  to be used in patients with post operative ileus and iii an oral form of methylnaltrexone  to be used in patients with opioid induced constipation 
under the collaboration agreement  we granted to wyeth an exclusive  worldwide license  even as to us  to develop and commercialize methylnaltrexone 
we are responsible for developing the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of methylnaltrexone in the united states  until the drug formulations receive regulatory approval 
wyeth is responsible for the development of the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of methylnaltrexone outside of the united states 
wyeth is responsible for the development of the oral form of methylnaltrexone  both within the united states and in the rest of the world 
in the event the jsc approves any formulation of methylnaltrexone other than subcutaneous  intravenous or oral or any other indication for the products currently contemplated using the subcutaneous  intravenous or oral forms of methylnaltrexone  wyeth will be responsible for development of such products  including conducting clinical trials and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval and we will receive royalties on all sales of such products 
we will remain the owner of all us regulatory filings and approvals relating to the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of methylnaltrexone 
wyeth will be the owner of all us regulatory filings and approvals related to the oral form of methylnaltrexone 
wyeth will be the owner of all regulatory filings and approvals outside the united states relating to all forms of methylnaltrexone 
wyeth is responsible for the commercialization of the subcutaneous  intravenous and oral products throughout the world  will pay all costs of commercialization of all products  including all manufacturing costs  and will retain all proceeds from the sale of the products  subject to the royalties payable by wyeth to us

purchase of rights from methylnaltrexone licensors on december   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  progenics pharmaceuticals nevada  inc  collectively  we acquired certain rights for our lead investigational drug  methylnaltrexone  from several of our licensors 
in  we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with ur labs  inc url to develop and commercialize methylnaltrexone the methylnaltrexone sublicense in exchange for rights to future payments resulting from the methylnaltrexone sublicense 
in  url obtained an exclusive license to methylnaltrexone  as amended  from the university of chicago uc under an option and license agreement dated may   as amended the url chicago license 
in  url also entered into an agreement with certain heirs of dr 
leon goldberg the goldberg distributees  which provided them with the right to receive payments based upon revenues received by url from the development of the methylnaltrexone sublicense the url goldberg agreement 

table of contents on december   we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the purchase agreement by and among progenics pharmaceuticals  inc  progenics pharmaceuticals nevada  inc  ur labs  inc and the shareholders of ur labs  inc 
the url shareholders  under which we acquired substantially all of the assets of url  comprised of its rights under the url chicago license  the methylnaltrexone sublicense and the url goldberg agreement  thus assuming url s rights and responsibilities under those agreements and extinguishing our obligation to make royalty and other payments to url 
on december   we entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with the goldberg distributees  under which we assumed all rights and obligations of the goldberg distributees under the url goldberg agreement  thereby extinguishing url s and consequentially  our obligations to make payments to the goldberg distributees 
although we are no longer obligated to make payments to url or the goldberg distributees  we are required to make future payments including royalties to the university of chicago that would have been made by url 
in consideration for the assignment of the goldberg distributees rights and of the acquisition of the assets of url described above  we issued  on december   a total of  shares of our common stock  with a fair value of million  based on a closing price of our common stock of  and paid a total of million in cash representing the opening market value  per share  of  shares of progenics common stock on the date of the acquisition to the url shareholders and the goldberg distributees and paid  in transaction fees  the total amount of which was expensed in the period of the transaction 
psma development company llc 
in june  the members formed a joint venture in the form of a limited liability company  with equal membership interests  for the purposes of conducting research  development  manufacturing and marketing of products related to psma 
prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest see below  each member had equal ownership and equal representation on psma llc s management committee and equal voting rights and rights to profits and losses of psma llc 
in connection with the formation of psma llc  the members entered into a series of agreements  including an llc agreement and a licensing agreement  which generally defined the rights and obligations of each member  including the obligations of the members with respect to capital contributions and funding of research and development of psma llc for each coming year 
with certain limited exceptions  all patents and know how owned by us or cytogen and used or useful in the development of psma based antibody or vaccine immunotherapeutics were licensed to the joint venture 
the principal intellectual property licensed initially were several patents and patent applications owned by sloan kettering that relate to psma 
we and cytogen were also required to offer to license to psma llc patents  patent applications and technical information used or useful in psma llc s field to which we or cytogen acquire licensable rights 
on april   we acquired cytogen s membership interest in psma llc  including cytogen s economic interests in capital  profits  losses and distributions of psma llc and its voting rights  in exchange for a cash payment of million the acquisition 
we also paid million of transaction costs with regard to the acquisition 
costs associated with the acquisition were expensed in the period of the transaction 
in connection with the acquisition  the license agreement entered into by the members upon the formation of psma llc  under which cytogen had granted a license to psma llc for certain psma related intellectual property  was amended 
prior to the acquisition  each of the members owned of the rights to that intellectual property through their interests in psma llc 
under the amended license agreement  cytogen granted an exclusive  even as to cytogen  worldwide license to psma llc to use certain psma related intellectual property in a defined field the amended license agreement 
in addition  under the terms of the amended license agreement  psma llc will pay to cytogen upon the achievement of certain defined regulatory and sales milestones  if ever  amounts totaling million  and will pay royalties on net sales  as defined 
we will continue to conduct the psma related programs on our own 
our purchase of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc is expected to improve the efficiency of decision making regarding psma projects 
beginning on april   cytogen has no further involvement with psma llc  which has become our wholly owned subsidiary 
although we are continuing to conduct the psma related research and development activities  we will no longer recognize revenue from psma llc 
prior to the acquisition  psma llc s intellectual property  which was equally owned by each of the members  was used in two research and development programs  a vaccine program and a monoclonal antibody program  both of which were in the pre clinical or early clinical phases of development at the time of the acquisition 
we conducted most of the research and development for those two programs prior to the acquisition and  subsequent to the acquisition  are continuing those research and development activities and will incur all the expenses of those programs 
before any products resulting from the vaccine and the monoclonal antibody programs that were jointly under development at the date of our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest can be commercialized  psma llc must complete pre clinical studies and phases through clinical trials for each project and file and receive approval of new drug applications with the fda 
due to the complexities and uncertainties of scientific research and the early stage of the psma programs  the timing and costs of such further development efforts and the anticipated completion dates of those programs  if ever  cannot reliably be determined at the acquisition date 
however  those efforts are expected to require at least three years  based upon the timing of our other early stage development projects 
there can be no assurance that either of the psma programs will reach technological feasibility or that they will ever be commercially viable 
the risks associated with development and commercialization of these programs include delay or failure of basic research  failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials and to market products  and patent litigation

for the year ended december   although we had a pre tax net loss of million for book purposes  we had taxable income due primarily to the million upfront payment received from wyeth and the million cash and common stock paid to ur labs and the goldberg distributees  which were treated differently for book and tax purposes 
for book purposes  payments made to ur labs and the goldberg distributees were expensed in the period the payments were made 
however  for tax purposes  the ur labs transaction was a tax free reorganization and will never result in a deduction for tax purposes and the payments to the goldberg distrbutees have been capitalized as an intangible license asset and will be deducted for tax purposes over a fifteen year period 
for book purposes  we deferred recognition of revenue for the million at december  and are recognizing revenue for that amount over the development period for mntx expected to end 
for tax purposes  since cash was received  the million was included in taxable income in we  therefore  recognized an income tax provision in for the effect of the federal and state alternative minimum tax 
net loss our net loss was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview we have to date generated no meaningful amounts of recurring revenue  and consequently we have relied principally on external funding to finance our operations 
we have funded our operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaboration agreements  public offerings of common stock  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments  the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million compared with million at december  our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  are sufficient to fund current operations for at least one year 
our marketable securities  which include corporate debt and securities of government sponsored entities  are classified as available for sale 
the majority of these investments have short maturities 
interest rate increases during have generally resulted in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio 
based upon our currently projected sources and uses of cash  we intend to hold these securities until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity 
therefore  we do not consider these marketable securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the following is a discussion of cash flow activities years ended december  in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from a net loss of million  which was offset by million of non cash compensation expense from the issuance of restricted stock and stock options to employees and non employees  million of expense of purchased technology in connection with our purchase of cytogen s equity interest in psma llc and million of depreciation expense on our fixed assets 
although we purchased million of capital equipment during  million of that amount was in construction in progress related to the expansion of our laboratory and manufacturing facilities and was not subject to depreciation 
in addition  the significant changes in operating assets and liabilities between and were a decrease of million in deferred revenue in resulting from the amortization of the million upfront payment received from wyeth in and deferred revenue related to payments by wyeth for development expenses  a decrease of million in trade accounts receivable  mostly related to reimbursement of our fourth quarter expenses under grants and contract with the nih  and an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  due to timing of payments 

table of contents during  cash provided by operating activities was mostly the result of the offset of a net loss of million by non cash expenses of million related to the purchase of rights from our licensors of methylnaltrexone in exchange for our common stock see overview purchase of rights from licensors of methylnaltrexone  million of non cash amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance to employees of restricted stock during and and from the issuance of compensatory stock options to executive officers and non employees  million in depreciation expense and million of loss from our psma llc joint venture with cytogen 
significant changes in operating assets and liabilities between and were an increase of million in deferred revenue in resulting from the upfront payment received from wyeth and increased contributions of million to psma llc upon approval of a work plan and a budget by the members  in june  for the year ended december  the work plan and budget required greater capital contributions during than did the corresponding work plan and budget 
in addition  there was an increase of million in trade accounts receivable  mostly for reimbursement of our fourth quarter expenses under grants and contract with the nih  and an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  as the pace of our research and development activities  especially for methylnaltrexone  increased in over that in cash used in operating activities for resulted from a net loss of million  which was partially offset by million of non cash amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance to employees of restricted stock during and from the issuance of compensatory stock options to non employees  million in depreciation expense and million of loss from our psma llc joint venture with cytogen 
significant changes in operating assets and liabilities between and were an increase of million due to additional capital contributions to psma llc upon approval of a work plan and a budget by the members  an increase of million in trade accounts receivable  mostly for reimbursement of our fourth quarter expenses under grants and contract with the nih  and an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  as the pace of our research and development activities  especially for methylnaltrexone  increased in over that in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with net cash used in investing activities of million and net cash provided by investing activities of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the purchase of cytogen s interest in psma llc for million  net of million of cash acquired and the sale of million of marketable securities offset by the purchase of million of marketable securities 
during  we raised approximately million in three public offerings of our common stock and invested most of those funds in marketable securities 
as a result  in and  we used net cash in investing activities rather than having net cash provided by investing activities as in we purchase and sell marketable securities in order to provide funding for our operations and to achieve appreciation of our unused cash in a low risk environment 
we also purchased million  million and million of fixed assets  during the years ended december   and  respectively  including capital equipment and leasehold improvements as we acquired and built out additional manufacturing space and purchased more laboratory equipment for our expanding research and development projects 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities for includes million in net proceeds that we received from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock during in addition  all periods reflect the exercise of stock options under our stock incentive plans and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
cash received from exercises under such plans during and was less than that in since a major portion of exercises during were of options from a former executive 
sources of cash our current collaboration with wyeth provided us with a million upfront payment in december in addition  beginning in january  wyeth has begun reimbursing us for development expenses we incur related to methylnaltrexone under the development plan agreed to between us and wyeth  which is expected to continue through wyeth has and will continue to provide milestone and other contingent payments upon the achievement of certain events 
wyeth will also fund all commercialization costs of methylnaltrexone products 
for the year ended december   we received million of reimbursement of our development costs  which are within the development plan approved by the parties 
in october  we earned a million milestone payment in connection with the start of a phase clinical trial of intravenous methylnaltrexone for the treatment of post operative ileus 

table of contents since our development costs for methylnaltrexone are funded by wyeth  we are able to devote our current and future resources to our other research and development programs 
we may also enter into collaboration agreements with respect to other of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty  however  which products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  or how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
the consummation of other collaboration agreements would further allow us to advance other projects with our current funds 
however  unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for at least one of our product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to the development of our technologies in addition to that for methylnaltrexone  we will be required to fund our operations for periods in the future  by seeking additional financing through future offerings of equity or debt securities or funding from additional grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
in september  we were awarded a contract from the nih 
the nih contract provides for up to million in funding  subject to annual funding approvals  to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
these funds are being used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
a total of approximately million is earmarked under the nih contract to fund subcontracts 
funding under the nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of million in fees is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of million from this contract  including  for the achievement of two milestones 
we have also been awarded grants from the nih  which provide ongoing funding for a portion of our virology and cancer research programs for periods including the years ended december   and among those grants were two awards made during  which provide for up to million and million  respectively  in support for our hepatitis c virus research program and pro hiv development program  respectively  to be awarded over a three year and a three and a half year period  respectively 
funding under all of our nih grants is subject to compliance with their terms  and is subject to annual funding approvals 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of revenue from all of our nih grants 
other than amounts to be received from wyeth and from currently approved grants and contracts  we have no committed external sources of capital 
other than potential revenues from methylnaltrexone  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our products to the commercial marketing stage 
during the year ended december   we completed three public offerings of common stock  pursuant to form s shelf registrations that we had filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in and  which provided us with a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares 
in january  we registered an additional million shares of our common stock  pursuant to the sec s shelf registration process  for future sales 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any further securities transactions 
uses of cash our total expenses for research and development  including license fees  from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating gastroenterology  hiv related diseases and oncology 
in addition  we are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and oncology 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence in certain instances on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred were as follows 
expenses for methylnaltrexone for include million related to our purchase of rights from methylnaltrexone licensors 
expenses for cancer for includes million related to our purchase of cytogen s interest in our psma joint venture see overview purchase of rights from methylnaltrexone licensors  overview psma development company llc and results of operations expenses  above for more details for the year ended december  in millions methylnaltrexone hiv cancer other programs total as we proceed with our development responsibilities under our methylnaltrexone programs  although we expect that our spending on methylnaltrexone will increase significantly during  our cash outlays in accordance with the agreed upon development plan will be reimbursed by wyeth 
we also expect that spending on our pro and other programs will increase during and beyond 
consequently  we may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  for the cost of product in licensing and for any possible acquisitions 
manufacturing and commercialization expenses for methylnaltrexone will be funded by wyeth 
however  if we exercise our option to co promote methylnaltrexone products in the us  which must be approved by wyeth  we will be required to establish and fund a salesforce  which we currently do not have 
if we commercialize any other product candidate other than with a corporate collaborator  we would also require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
our purchase of rights from our methylnaltrexone licensors in december see overview purchase of rights from methylnaltrexone licensors  above have extinguished our cash payments that would have been due to those licensors in the future upon the achievement of certain events  including sales of methylnaltrexone products 
we continue  however  to be responsible to make payments including royalties to the university of chicago upon the occurrence of certain events 
prior to our acquisition of psma llc on april   all costs of psma llc s research and development efforts were funded equally by us and cytogen through capital contributions 
our and cytogen s level of commitment to fund psma llc was based on an annual budget that was developed and approved by the parties 
during the year ended december   the members each contributed million to fund work under the approved budget and million to fund work under the approved budget 
during  prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc  we and cytogen had not approved a work plan and budget for and  therefore  no further capital contributions were made by the members subsequent to december  however  we and cytogen were required to fulfill obligations under existing contractual commitments as of december  since psma llc has become our wholly owned subsidiary as of april   we no longer make capital contributions 
costs incurred by psma llc from january  to april  were funded from psma llc s cash reserves 
we are continuing to conduct the psma research and development projects on our own subsequent to our acquisition of psma llc and are required to fund the entire amount of such efforts  thus  increasing our cash expenditures 
we are funding psma related research and development efforts from our internally generated cash flows 
we are also continuing to receive funding from the nih for a portion of our psma related research and development costs 
during the years ended december   and  we have spent million  million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures  including the purchase of a second liter bioreactor for the manufacture of research and clinical products  the build out of our laboratories and manufacturing facilities and laboratory equipment 
during and beyond  we expect that such expenditures will increase as we continue to lease and renovate additional laboratory and manufacturing space and increase headcount of our research and development and administrative staff 
contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and licensing and collaboration agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements 
table of contents payments due by december  total thereafter in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements total assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement  including those by psma llc 
the timing of the achievement of the related milestones is highly uncertain  and accordingly the actual timing of payments  if any  is likely to vary  perhaps significantly  relative to the timing contemplated by this table 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development of these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and adversely impact our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with  licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be changes that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other unconsolidated entity 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition on december   we entered into a license and co development agreement with wyeth  which includes a non refundable upfront license fee  reimbursement of development costs  research and development payments based upon our achievement of clinical development milestones  contingent payments based upon the achievement by wyeth of defined events and royalties on product sales 
we began recognizing contract research revenue from wyeth on january  during the years ended december   and  we also recognized revenue from government research grants and contracts  which are used to subsidize a portion of certain of our research projects projects  exclusively from the nih 
we also recognized revenue from the sale of research reagents during those periods 
in addition  we recognized contract research and development revenue exclusively from psma llc for the years ended december  and no revenue was recognized from psma llc for the year ended december  we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition  emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and eitf issue no 
eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
non refundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we would recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research or steering committee services  could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents will typically be used as the measure of performance 
under the proportionate performance method  revenue related to upfront license payments is recognized in any period as the percent of actual effort expended in that period relative to total effort budgeted for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis  then the total upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
collaborations may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payment is non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment the substantive milestone method 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 

table of contents we will recognize revenue for payments that are contingent upon performance solely by our collaborator immediately upon the achievement of the defined event if we have no related performance obligations 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon management s current operating budget for the wyeth collaboration agreement for our total effort required to complete our performance obligations under that arrangement 
that estimate may change in the future and such changes to estimates would result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
nih grant and contract revenue is recognized as efforts are expended and as related subsidized project costs are incurred 
we perform work under the nih grants and contract on a best effort basis 
the nih reimburses us for costs associated with projects in the fields of hiv and cancer  including preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus  as requested by the nih 
substantive at risk milestone payments are uncommon in these arrangements  but would be recognized as revenue on the same basis as the substantive milestone method 
prior to our acquisition of cytogen s membership interest in psma llc on april   both we and cytogen were required to fund psma llc equally to support ongoing research and development efforts that we conducted on behalf of psma llc 
we recognized payments for research and development as revenue as services were performed 
however  during the quarter ended march   the members had not approved a work plan or budget for therefore  beginning on january   we had not been reimbursed by psma llc for our services and we did not recognize revenue from psma llc for the quarter ended march  beginning in the second quarter of  psma llc has become our wholly owned subsidiary and  accordingly  we no longer recognize revenue from psma llc

accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 we had elected to follow the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
and  accordingly  accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options were issued to employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying stock price on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements and pro forma compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
was only disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

table of contents we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application  under which compensation cost for all share based awards that were unvested as of the adoption date and those newly granted or modified after the adoption date will be recognized in our financial statements over the related requisite service periods  usually the vesting periods for awards with a service condition 
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value of awards that are expected to vest 
we apply a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested awards in each reporting period in order to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data on vesting behavior of employees 
we adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award  in the period in which each award vests  to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award 
changes in our estimated forfeiture rate will result in changes in the rate at which compensation cost for an award is recognized over its vesting period 
previously  under sfas no 
 we applied a zero forfeiture rate and recognized the effect of forfeitures only as they occurred 
we have made an accounting policy decision to use the straight line method of attribution of compensation expense  under which the grant date fair value of share based awards will be recognized on a straight line basis over the total requisite service period for the total award 
for the year ended december   total compensation cost for share based payment arrangements recognized in income was million  million of which was reported as research and development expense and million of which was reported as general and administrative expense 
no tax benefit was recognized related to that compensation cost because we had a net loss for the period and the related deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
accordingly  no amounts related to windfall tax benefits have been reported in cash flows from operations or cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  
as of december   there was million  million and  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options  nonvested shares and our employee stock purchase plans  respectively  which is expected to be recognized over weighted average periods of years  years and months  respectively 
upon adoption of sfas r  we eliminated million of unearned compensation  related to share based awards granted prior to the adoption date that were unvested as of january   against additional paid in capital 
compensation expense reported on a pro forma basis for periods prior to adoption of sfas no 
r has not been revised and is not reflected in the financial statements of those prior periods 
accordingly  there was no effect of the change from applying the original provisions of sfas no 
on net income  cash flow from operations  cash flows from financing activities or basic or diluted net loss per share of periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
furthermore  no modifications were made to outstanding options prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r and no changes to the quantity or type of share based awards or changes to the terms of share based payment arrangements were made 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of each non qualified stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires input assumptions of stock price on the date of grant  exercise price  volatility  expected term  dividend rate and risk free interest rate 
the same model  with input assumptions developed in the same manner  was used to determine the fair value of share based payment awards for purposes of the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we use the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  as quoted on the nasdaq stock market llc  as the exercise price 
historical volatilities are based upon daily quoted market prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
we rely only on historical volatility since future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical  historical volatility is calculated using a simple average calculation  historical data is available for the length of the option s expected term and a sufficient number of price observations are used consistently 
since our stock options are not traded on a public market  we do not use implied volatility 
for the years ended december   and  the volatility of our common stock has been high   and  respectively  which is common for entities in the biotechnology industry that do not have commercial products 
a higher volatility input to the black scholes model increases the resulting compensation expense 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
for the year ended december   our expected term has been calculated based upon the simplified method as detailed in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
accordingly  we are using an expected term of years based upon the vesting period of the outstanding options of four or five years and a contractual term of ten years 
for the year ended december   our expected term of years is based upon the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term 
for the year ended december   our expected term of years represents the average of the maximum contractual term of our stock option awards of years 
we plan to refine our estimate of expected term in the future as we obtain more historical data 
a shorter expected term would result in a lower compensation expense 

table of contents we have never paid dividends and do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
therefore  our dividend rate is zero 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
a portion of the options granted to our chief executive officer on july    and and on july  cliff vests after nine years and eleven months from the respective grant date 
vesting of a defined portion of each award will occur earlier if a defined performance condition is achieved  more than one condition may be achieved in any period 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  at the end of each reporting period  we will estimate the probability of achievement of each performance condition and will use those probabilities to determine the requisite service period of each award 
the requisite service period for the award is the shortest of the explicit or implied service periods 
in the case of the executive s options  the explicit service period is nine years and eleven months from the respective grant dates 
the implied service periods related to the performance conditions are the estimated times for each performance condition to be achieved 
thus  compensation expense will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of performance conditions for that award assuming that the performance conditions will be achieved before the cliff vesting occurs 
changes in the estimate of probability of achievement of any performance condition will be reflected in compensation expense of the period of change and future periods affected by the change 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  these awards were accounted for as variable awards under apb and  therefore  compensation expense  based on the intrinsic value of the vested awards on each reporting date  was recognized in our financial statements 
for purposes of pro forma compensation expense under sfas no 
as well as upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the fair value of shares purchased under the purchase plans was estimated on the date of grant in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option 
the same option valuation model was used for the purchase plans as for non qualified stock options  except that the expected term for the purchase plans is six months and the historical volatility is calculated over the six month expected term 
in applying the treasury stock method for the calculation of diluted earnings per share eps  amounts of unrecognized compensation expense and windfall tax benefits are required to be included in the assumed proceeds in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation unless they are anti dilutive 
we incurred a net loss for the years ended december   and  and  therefore  such amounts have not been included for those periods in the calculation of diluted eps since they would be anti dilutive 
accordingly  basic and diluted eps are the same for those periods 
we have made an accounting policy decision to calculate windfall tax benefits shortfalls for purposes of diluted eps calculations  excluding the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets 
this policy decision will apply when we have net income 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
we expect that clinical trial expenses will increase significantly during as clinical trials progress or are initiated in the methylnaltrexone and hiv programs 
our collaboration agreement with wyeth regarding methylnaltrexone in which wyeth has assumed all of the financial responsibility for further development will mitigate those costs

fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
fin applies to income taxes and is not intended to be applied by analogy to other taxes  such as sales taxes  value add taxes  or property taxes 
under fin  the financial statements will reflect the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based upon its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures  including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next months  a description of open tax years by major jurisdictions  and a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits  presented as a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the unrecognized tax benefits on a worldwide aggregated basis 
fin is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years that start after december  we have assessed the impact of fin on our financial position and results of operations as of january   the date of our adoption of fin the only tax jurisdiction to which we are subject is the united states 
open tax years relate to years in which unused net operating losses were generated or  if used  for which the statute of limitation for examination by taxing authorities has not expired 
thus  upon adoption of fin  our open tax years extend back to  with the exception of  during which we reported net income 
we have determined that the adoption of fin will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on september   the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab in order to address the observed diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements with respect to annual financial statements 
there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement errors the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
in sab  the sec staff established a dual approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
sab is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  our adoption of sab had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on september   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which addresses how companies should measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
fas does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under fas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
fas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
fas requires disclosures intended to provide information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
we will adopt fas on january  we do not expect the impact of the adoption of fas to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing our risk 
our investments consist of taxable auction securities  corporate notes and issues of government sponsored entities 
our investments totaled million at december  approximately million of these investments had fixed interest rates  and million had interest rates that were variable 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our fixed interest rate long term investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these investments due to differences between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the investment 
a basis point increase in the december  market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in the market values of these investments 
at december   the company did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments
