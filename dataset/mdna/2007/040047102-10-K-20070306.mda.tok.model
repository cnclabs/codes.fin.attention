part i item business 
we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing oral drugs in four major therapeutic areas cardiovascular  central nervous system  inflammatory and metabolic diseases 
our most advanced drug candidate  lorcaserin hydrochloride  or lorcaserin  is being investigated in a phase clinical trial program for the treatment of obesity 
we have a broad pipeline of novel compounds that target known and orphan g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  and includes compounds being evaluated independently and with our partners  ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc and merck co  inc 
in september  we initiated the first of three planned phase pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of lorcaserin  our lead drug candidate under investigation for the treatment of obesity 
the first trial  known as bloom behavioral modification and lorcaserin for overweight and obesity management  is a double blinded  randomized and placebo controlled trial 
in this trial  we recently completed enrollment of  overweight and obese patients in approximately centers in the united states 
a phase b clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with lorcaserin produced a highly statistically significant  progressive and dose dependent weight loss over a week period 
an assessment of echocardiograms for patients in the phase b trial indicated that lorcaserin had no apparent effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure 
in addition to lorcaserin  our other lead internal development programs include apd and apd we recently initiated dosing in a phase clinical trial of apd  which is an orally available drug candidate that we discovered and believe has the potential to reduce insomnia symptoms and improve sleep maintenance 
we expect to initiate a phase clinical trial of apd around the middle of apd is an orally available drug candidate that we discovered and are investigating for the treatment and the prevention of arterial thromboembolic diseases such as acute coronary syndrome 
in addition to internal programs  we have active partnerships with two major pharmaceutical companies ortho mcneil and merck 
our ortho mcneil partnership is focused on diabetes  and our most advanced drug candidate in this partnership is apd  an arena discovered  orally administered drug candidate that is in clinical development for the treatment of type diabetes 
our merck partnership is focused on niacin receptor agonists as treatments for atherosclerosis and other disorders  and several orally administered drug candidates are under preclinical evaluation 
we focus on gpcrs because they are a validated class of drug targets that mediate the majority of cell to cell communication in humans 
a high percentage of today s prescription drugs target one or more gpcrs  and we believe that approved gpcr based drugs target about  or  of the approximately known non sensory gpcrs 
we believe our gpcr focused technologies and integrated discovery and development capabilities will allow us to continue to build our pipeline of unique and selective drug candidates 
we intend to commercialize our drug candidates independently and with partners 
we have not received regulatory approval for  or generated commercial revenues from  marketing or selling any drugs 
we were incorporated in our research development programs we have built a broad pipeline of drug candidates that target large and attractive market opportunities in several therapeutic areas 
the following table summarizes our current independent and partnered development programs and selected research programs program indication development status next potential milestone commercial rights lorcaserin obesity phase first dsmb review arena apd insomnia phase complete phase arena apd arterial thrombosis preclinical initiate phase arena apd diabetes phase initiate phase ortho mcneil mk undisclosed preclinical reinitiate clinical trials merck niacin receptor agonist atherosclerosis  raise hdl preclinical initiate phase merck type diabetes obesity research arena wakefulness promoter research arena cardioprotection research arena cytokine immune cell modulators research arena note the table above does not list all of our research programs 
merck discontinued development of mk for the treatment of atherosclerosis after a phase clinical trial completed in  but is evaluating mk for continued development for an undisclosed indication under our partnership 
merck is also continuing to evaluate other niacin receptor agonists for the treatment of atherosclerosis and other disorders under our partnership 
lorcaserin we are investigating lorcaserin in a phase clinical trial program for the treatment of obesity 
obesity affects tens of millions of adults and children in the united states and poses serious long term threats to their health and welfare 
studies have shown that modest weight loss of as little as five percent of initial body weight can result in a meaningful reduction in the risks associated with obesity  such as diabetes 
currently  medical treatment options for obesity are limited 
lorcaserin is a novel and selective htc serotonin receptor agonist 
two non selective  serotonin acting drugs  fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine often used in combination with phentermine  the combination of which was commonly referred to as fen phen  although efficacious as appetite suppressants and for treatment of obesity  were withdrawn from the market in after incidences of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension were associated with their usage 
the fenfluramines release serotonin and have the potential to activate all serotonin receptors  including the htb receptor 
stimulation of this receptor has been implicated in the heart valve abnormalities associated with these drugs 
based on our preclinical studies and clinical trial data to date  we believe that lorcaserin stimulates the htc serotonin receptor more selectively than fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine  and is therefore unlikely to cause the cardiovascular side effects associated with those drugs 
this belief is supported by data from our and week clinical trials  in which no apparent effects of the drug were seen on heart valves or pulmonary arterial pressure 
however  additional longer term trials will be needed to confirm these results 
this is part of the focus of our phase clinical trial program  which began with the bloom trial we initiated in september mechanism of action 
we believe lorcaserin selectively stimulates the htc serotonin receptor  a gpcr located in the hypothalamus 
stimulation of this hypothalamic receptor is strongly associated with feeding behavior and satiety 
we conducted preclinical studies examining the activity and ht receptor subtype specificity of lorcaserin 
in these studies  lorcaserin demonstrated a high affinity and specificity for the htc receptor  with approximately fold and fold selectivity over the hta and htb receptors  respectively  and no pharmacologic activity at other serotonin receptors 
prior clinical development 
we have completed multiple phase and phase clinical trials of lorcaserin 
our phase a trial included obese patients dosed for days  and our phase b included obese patients dosed for weeks 
highly statistically significant  clinically meaningful and progressive weight loss was observed in both phase trials  with no apparent drug effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure  as assessed by serial echocardiograms 
lorcaserin was also generally well tolerated in both phase trials 
the randomized  double blinded  multiple dose  day phase a clinical trial of lorcaserin in obese patients compared doses of mg  mg and mg to placebo 
over the day treatment period there was a highly statistically significant p mean weight loss of pounds in patients taking the mg dose of lorcaserin versus pounds for the placebo group 
lorcaserin was generally well tolerated at all doses investigated in the trial 
an assessment of follow up echocardiograms taken at the end of dosing and approximately days after patients received their first doses of lorcaserin in the phase a clinical trial indicated no apparent drug effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure 
a randomized  double blinded  multiple dose  week phase b clinical trial of lorcaserin in obese patients compared doses of mg and mg once daily and mg mg dosed twice daily of lorcaserin to placebo 
the primary endpoint of the trial  which excluded diet and exercise advice  was weight loss after administration of lorcaserin for weeks 
patients completing the week treatment period with lorcaserin achieved a highly statistically significant p mean weight loss of  and pounds at daily doses of mg  mg and mg mg dosed twice daily  respectively  compared to pounds for the placebo group 
using an intent to treat  last observation carried forward analysis  treatment with lorcaserin was also associated with a highly statistically significant p mean weight loss of  and pounds at daily doses of mg  mg and mg mg dosed twice daily  respectively  in patients taking lorcaserin compared to pounds for the placebo group 
the proportions of patients completing the week treatment period with lorcaserin who achieved a or greater weight loss from baseline were p  p and p at daily doses of mg  mg and mg mg dosed twice daily  respectively  compared to in the placebo group 
lorcaserin was generally well tolerated at all doses investigated in the trial 
adverse events occurring in greater than in any of the dosed groups were headache  nausea  dizziness  vomiting  dry mouth  nasopharyngitis  fatigue and urinary tract infection 
as demonstrated by the graph below  average weight loss increased progressively at each time point measured throughout the trial for all lorcaserin dose groups  and was dose dependent 
as we expected  after patients stopped taking lorcaserin  they started to regain weight 
lorcaserin phase b clinical trial weight loss by dose and time 
gdeijpg 
an assessment of echocardiograms at baseline and day indicated no apparent lorcaserin effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure 
no changes in valvular regurgitation greater than one category  no significant differences between any treatment group and placebo in number of increases in valve regurgitation at any valve  and no significant increases in pulmonary artery pressure in any group were identified in the echocardiogram results 
valvular regurgitation  a measure of back flow or leakage of blood through heart valves due to imperfect valve closing  was scored on a five point scale absent  trace  mild  moderate or severe 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  defines valvulopathy as mild or greater aortic valve regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral valve regurgitation 
this is one measure used in our phase program to assess potential effects of lorcaserin on heart valves 
as demonstrated by the table below  the incidence of fda defined valvulopathy was greater in the placebo group versus the combined lorcaserin treated groups

percent by treatment phase clinical development 
following our discussions with the fda  in september we initiated the first of three planned pivotal phase clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorcaserin for the treatment of obesity 
we recently completed enrollment of  overweight and obese patients in approximately centers in the united states in the first trial  bloom  which is double blinded  randomized and placebo controlled 
the bloom trial will evaluate a mg dose mg dosed twice daily of lorcaserin versus placebo over a two year treatment period in obese patients body mass index  or bmi  of to with or without co morbid conditions and overweight patients bmi of to with at least one co morbid condition 
the primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with a or greater weight reduction from baseline at week as compared to placebo 
all patients will receive echocardiograms at baseline and follow up echocardiograms at   and months after starting the trial 
echocardiograms will be reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  at and months 
using predetermined safety criteria  the dsmb will review the echocardiographic data and make a judgment as to whether it is appropriate to continue the trial 
we completed enrollment in bloom in early  and expect the dsmb to perform its month six review of echocardiograms and make its judgment in the third quarter of the complete lorcaserin phase program is designed to enroll a total of approximately  patients in three pivotal trials 
assuming a positive month six safety assessment from the dsmb for the bloom trial  we intend to initiate two additional phase trials enrolling a total of approximately  patients 
in these pivotal trials  we plan to evaluate the mg dose mg dosed twice daily and a mg once daily dose  each versus placebo over a one year treatment period  and for one of the trials to enroll patients with type diabetes 
diet and exercise programs will be part of each of the pivotal trials 
in addition to the above planned pivotal trial program  we will conduct several other small trials  including drug interaction and abuse potential studies 
assuming we receive favorable results from the dsmb reviews and the phase program and other trials  we expect to file a new drug application  or nda  for lorcaserin in intellectual property 
as of january   we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for lorcaserin and related compounds and methods of treatment utilizing lorcaserin and related compounds in jurisdictions including the united states  germany  france  the united kingdom  italy and spain  and applications pending in approximately other jurisdictions including japan  canada and china 
based on sales statistics provided by ims health  the jurisdictions where lorcaserin patents have been issued accounted for more than of global pharmaceutical sales in  while jurisdictions where lorcaserin patents remain pending accounted for more than of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year 
the patent on lorcaserin issued by the united states patent and trademark office is serial number us  and the corresponding patent granted by the european patent office is serial number ep b the earliest priority date for the patents on lorcaserin is the terms of these patents are capable of continuing into in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term extension regimes of any country 
apd we recently initiated our phase clinical trial of our lead drug candidate for the treatment of insomnia  apd  which is a novel and selective hta serotonin receptor inverse agonist 
the national institutes of health estimated in that between to of us adults report some level of insomnia and that insomnia is a chronic problem for about percent of the us population 
in these cases  the lack of restful sleep impairs the person s ability to carry out their daily responsibilities because they are too tired or have trouble concentrating 
however  the great majority of insomnia patients do not seek treatment 
currently marketed therapies for insomnia include ambien and ambien cr  marketed by sanofi aventis  lunesta  marketed by sepracor inc  sonata  marketed by king pharmaceuticals  inc  rozerem  a melatonin mt and mt agonist marketed by takeda pharmaceuticals north america  inc  and certain benzodiazepines 
with the exception of rozerem  these therapies work by activating the gaba a receptor in the brain  causing a general suppressive effect on the central nervous system  or cns 
the gaba a drugs have side effects including the risk of developing tolerance to the drug and the potential for causing a sensation of dullness and lethargy upon awakening  often referred to as the hangover effect 
in addition  gaba a drugs are dea scheduled controlled substances due to their potential for abuse 
despite these limitations  worldwide sales estimates for insomnia medications were billion in mechanism and preclinical data 
apd acts through a different mechanism than currently marketed insomnia drugs 
based on our preclinical data  we believe that by selectively targeting the hta receptor  apd blocks one of several cns activating pathways  rather than initiating a general cns suppressive effect 
because of the different mechanism of action  apd may not have the side effects generally associated with currently marketed gaba a drugs 
through this novel mechanism  apd has the potential to reduce insomnia symptoms and improve sleep maintenance by decreasing the number of awakenings during the night  decreasing the amount of wake time after initial sleep onset and increasing the total amount of time spent asleep  including time in deep sleep  or slow wave sleep stage and stage sleep  the most restorative type of sleep 
our preclinical studies have shown that  in animals  apd increases both the quality and total time of non rem rapid eye movement or dream sleep  the most restorative phase of the sleep cycle in humans  while having no effect on rem sleep 
the total increase in non rem sleep time was manifested by fewer bouts of longer duration  indicating an increase in sleep consolidation 
in addition  animals treated with apd showed during non rem sleep an increase in delta power  a brain wave activity associated with increased sleep intensity 
the improvements in non rem duration and quality observed with apd administration were at least as robust as those observed with a prototypic gaba a hypnotic control drug  ambien 
however  unlike ambien  apd did not adversely affect rem sleep in these studies 
prior clinical development 
we have completed multiple phase clinical studies of apd in healthy volunteers 
this phase program consisted of three randomized  double blinded and placebo controlled trials evaluating the single and multiple dose safety and pharmacokinetics of apd in normal volunteers 
additionally  the program evaluated the pharmacodynamics of nighttime dosing by assessing effects on sleep patterns in normal volunteers using polysomnography 
in this phase clinical trial program  apd was well tolerated at single doses up to mg and repeated doses up to mg 
at mg  the maximum concentration in the body  or cmax  of apd plateaued  there were no significant differences in cmax among the mg  mg and mg doses 
at mg  the total overall exposure  or area under the curve  of apd also plateaued  the pharmacokinetics at the mg dose were generally similar to the mg dose 
at doses from mg  apd caused a robust and highly statistically significant p increase in the amount of deep  or slow wave  sleep in volunteers with normal sleep wake patterns 
in addition  other statistically significant signals indicative of improved sleep maintenance were seen  including statistically significant increases in stage and stage sleep  reductions in stage sleep  reductions in the number of awakenings and an increase in delta power  the deepest form of slow wave sleep 
adverse events were infrequent and apd was well tolerated 
based on our phase results  we do not expect apd to be limited by next day impairment of psychomotor skills or memory 
we believe that our clinical and preclinical data suggest that apd has the potential to improve the treatment of insomnia over gaba a drugs 
phase clinical development 
in march  we initiated dosing in a phase clinical trial of apd the phase clinical trial of apd is a randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of nighttime dosing in patients with chronic insomnia 
the trial will evaluate standard measurements of sleep  such as wake after sleep onset waso  number of awakenings  total sleep time and latency to persistent sleep 
the trial employs a cross over design and is expected to enroll a total of approximately male and female patients in about clinical sites in the united states 
we expect results from this trial around the end of intellectual property 
as of january   we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for apd and related compounds and methods of treatment utilizing apd and related compounds in jurisdictions including germany  france  the united kingdom  italy and spain  and applications pending in approximately other jurisdictions and international patent authorities including the united states  japan  canada and china 
based on sales statistics provided by ims health  the jurisdictions where apd patents have been issued accounted for more than of global pharmaceutical sales in  while jurisdictions where apd patents remain pending accounted for more than of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year 
the patent on apd issued by the european patent office is serial number ep b the earliest priority date for the patents on apd is the terms of these patents are capable of continuing into in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term extension regimes of any country 
apd our lead anti thrombotic drug candidate  apd  a novel  orally available and selective inverse agonist of the hta serotonin receptor  is in preclinical development 
apd is intended to lower the risk of arterial thrombosis by reducing the amplification of platelet aggregation  arterial constriction and intimal hyperplasia  or thickening of the vessel wall  mediated by serotonin 
thrombosis is the formation of a clot  or thrombus  inside a blood vessel that restricts the flow of blood 
the formation of a thrombus is often caused by an injury to the wall of the blood vessel 
the injury to the blood vessel activates platelets  which then aggregate and adhere to one another as they start to release certain factors  including serotonin  that facilitate thrombosis 
thrombi that form in diseased atherosclerotic arteries of the heart may cause acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction  and thrombi that form in the vessels of the brain may cause stroke 
the american heart association estimates that in the united states over million people alive in had survived either a myocardial infarction or a stroke 
to reduce the risk of future events  many patients receive daily anti thrombotic therapy 
worldwide sales of plavix  a leading anti thrombotic marketed by bristol myers squibb and sanofi aventis  totaled billion in  making it the second best selling drug in any therapeutic category 
mechanism and preclinical data 
apd is a novel  orally available and selective inverse agonist of the hta serotonin receptor 
serotonin activation of the hta receptor on platelets and vascular smooth muscle is thought to play an important role in the events leading to thrombosis  and elevated serotonin levels have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk 
normally  when a platelet is activated by one of a number of factors such as thrombin or collagen  the platelet releases serotonin  which  based on preclinical studies  promotes platelet aggregation  vasoconstriction and intimal hyperplasia 
by blocking activation of the hta receptor on platelets and in other cardiovascular tissues  apd may curb platelet aggregation  vasoconstriction and intimal hyperplasia in the clinical setting  thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis 
we believe apd represents a new approach to reducing the risk of arterial thrombo embolic disease 
apd demonstrated improved coronary artery flow in a preclinical study using the folts model  an established model of acute coronary syndrome 
in other preclinical studies  apd also demonstrated an improved separation of the dose needed for inhibition of thrombosis versus the dose that increased bleeding relative to existing therapies  suggesting that apd has the potential for improved safety relative to existing therapies 
we believe these results are consistent with blocking the role of serotonin in the thrombosis process 
development plan 
we advanced apd into preclinical development in december and plan to initiate clinical development around the middle of intellectual property 
as of january   we had patent applications covering compositions of matter for apd and related methods of treatment pending before the world intellectual property organization  or wipo designating all contracting states  and in additional jurisdictions that are not contracting states of the wipo 
ortho mcneil collaboration in our partnership with ortho mcneil  we are developing compounds for the potential treatment of type diabetes and other disorders by targeting an orphan gpcr  the glucose dependent insulinotropic receptor  or the gdir 
the gdir is a novel receptor discovered by arena that  in our preclinical models  demonstrated the ability to stimulate insulin production in response to increases in blood glucose 
under this partnership  ortho mcneil advanced apd  a novel  orally administered drug candidate discovered by arena  into a phase clinical trial in february diabetes is a major worldwide disease 
based on data  the international diabetes federation estimated that in there were million adults with diabetes worldwide  an increase of over since these figures included approximately million in the united states and approximately million in the european region 
approximately  or million  of diabetics worldwide suffer from type diabetes  which is characterized by inadequate response to insulin and or inadequate secretion of insulin as blood glucose levels rise 
therapies for type diabetes are directed toward correcting the body s inadequate response with oral or injectable medications  or directly modifying insulin levels through injection of insulin or insulin analogs 
oral medications for type diabetes include insulin releasers such as glyburide  insulin sensitizers such as actos and avandia  inhibitors of glucose production by the liver such as metformin  dpp iv inhibitors like januvia  as well as precose and glyset  which slow the uptake of glucose from the intestine 
the worldwide market for diabetes medications exceeded billion in  of which oral drugs exceeded billion 
however  a significant portion of type diabetics fail oral medication and require injected insulin therapy 
current oral medications for type diabetes have a number of side effects  including hypoglycemia  weight gain and edema 
numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are seeking to develop insulin sensitizers  novel insulin formulations and other therapeutics to improve the treatment of diabetes 
mechanism and preclinical data 
we have found the gdir to be expressed in beta cells  the cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin in response to increases in blood glucose 
we believe the gdir represents a novel mechanism for generating a new class of drugs for diabetes that may offer advantages over current approaches 
our preclinical results indicate that stimulating the gdir allows beta cells to produce insulin more efficiently in response to changes in blood glucose levels 
in addition  we have demonstrated in our preclinical studies that the gdir stimulates incretin hormone release and thus may enhance glucose homeostasis by this additional mechanism 
we have also found in these studies that stimulation of the gdir leads to increased levels and activity of intracellular factors thought to be involved in the preservation of beta cells 
our preclinical studies suggest that the gdir is amenable to oral small molecule drug development  and we have discovered potent  selective and orally available small molecule agonists of the gdir that improve glucose tolerance and lower blood glucose levels in animal models of diabetes 
the gdir mechanism is glucose dependent  so that in our animal studies our compounds only lowered blood glucose when it rose above normal levels  such as after a meal 
our preclinical results indicate these compounds do not lower normal fasting baseline glucose levels in animal models and  therefore  do not cause hypoglycemia  unlike the glucose insensitive sulphonylureas 
development and partnership status 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with ortho mcneil to further develop compounds for the potential treatment of type diabetes and other disorders 
in january  we received a non refundable million upfront payment and two milestone payments of million each and  in february  we received a million milestone payment related to ortho mcneil s initiation of a phase clinical trial of apd in september  ortho mcneil exercised its option to extend the research term of the agreement  committing to research funding of million through december   beyond which date we will no longer have significant involvement or perform services 
from the inception of this collaboration through december   we received million from ortho mcneil in upfront and milestone payments and million in research funding 
we are eligible to receive a total of million in milestone payments for each compound  as well as royalty payments associated with ortho mcneil s commercialization of any products discovered under the agreement 
these milestones include development and approval milestone payments of up to million for the first indication and million for the second indication for each compound  and up to million in sales milestone payments for each product resulting from the collaboration 
merck collaboration in our partnership with merck  we are collaborating on three gpcrs to develop therapeutics for atherosclerosis and other disorders 
we believe one or more of these gpcrs plays a role in regulating plasma lipid profiles  including hdl cholesterol  the so called good cholesterol  and is responsible for the hdl raising activity of niacin 
there are very successful drugs available for lowering ldl cholesterol 
however  development of novel  effective therapies to increase hdl cholesterol remains a major focus of research 
we believe that such therapies may reduce the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease and compete in the large dyslipidemia market 
in september  we announced that merck completed a phase clinical trial of mk  a niacin receptor agonist discovered by us and intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis and related disorders 
based on the results of this trial  merck discontinued development of mk for atherosclerosis  but is exploring continued development of the drug candidate under our partnership for an undisclosed indication 
merck also continues to evaluate other niacin receptor agonists under our partnership for atherosclerosis and related disorders 
in february  we amended our merck collaboration to reduce the number of arena research employees funded under the collaboration in exchange for merck making a million equity investment in arena equal to the reduction in their research funding obligation and at approximately a premium to the then current market price 
from the inception of this collaboration through december   we received million from merck in upfront and milestone payments  and an equity investment of million 
we may receive additional milestone payments of up to million for merck s clinical and marketing achievements  as well as royalty payments associated with merck s commercialization of any products discovered under the agreement 
in addition  we received research funding from merck through december  totaling million and  under our amended agreement  merck is obligated to pay us a total of million for collaboration research from january  to october   beyond which date we will no longer have significant involvement or perform services 
other research and development programs cardiovascular 
acute myocardial infarction  which is commonly known as a heart attack  is often followed in survivors by heart failure 
myocardial infarction and heart failure are often a direct consequence of atherosclerosis  and both remain major causes of death 
we have identified certain gpcrs that we believe play a role in the processes related to atherosclerosis and are seeking to identify small molecules directed at these gpcr targets that we believe could provide cardio protection following myocardial infarction 
cns disorders 
many gpcrs are predominately found in the brain or the cns  and  therefore  we believe targeting gpcrs provides an opportunity to selectively treat various cns diseases 
many approved drugs for indications ranging from insomnia and narcolepsy to depression  schizophrenia and parkinson s disease target gpcrs 
our discovery efforts in cns disorders are focused on indications with large market opportunities where current therapies have significant limitations 
inflammatory disorders 
we are developing small molecule therapeutics that target gpcrs involved in the inflammatory process 
we have identified gpcrs that are found in specific immune cell types 
we believe these gpcrs modulate the inflammatory process  and we are applying our screening technologies to these targets to identify small molecules that could activate or inhibit these gpcrs 
some of the gpcrs we are targeting are expressed on t and b cells and macrophages  and could be important in the modulation of key cytokines that mediate inflammatory processes such as tnf alpha 
other diabetes programs 
for metabolic diseases  we are working on a series of orphan gpcr targets in addition to the gdir in order to develop orally available therapies to treat type and type diabetes 
for example  we are conducting research with receptors that may act to regulate glucose uptake  glucose absorption  insulin sensitivity  insulin secretion  lipid levels and production of glucose in the liver 
in order to treat general metabolic disease  we have prioritized gpcrs that have the potential to modulate blood glucose and lipid levels 
other obesity programs 
in addition to lorcaserin and other compounds that act on the htc serotonin receptor  we have discovery programs focused on several different gpcrs implicated in obesity 
our drug discovery efforts are directed at identifying novel drug candidates that target gpcrs in the cns and peripheral tissues to reduce fat mass in humans 
we have identified both known and orphan gpcrs expressed in the hypothalamus  an area of the brain known to be critical for regulating satiety and metabolism  that we believe regulate food intake and weight 
we have also identified gpcrs in fat cells that may represent targets for obesity 
we have identified early lead compounds for obesity targets other than the htc serotonin receptor  and are currently evaluating these compounds for their ability to reduce food intake and body weight 
our proprietary gpcr technologies and programs our drug candidates have resulted from our gpcr focused drug discovery technologies and capabilities  including constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart  and our melanophore technology  and our overall approach to drug discovery and development 
gpcrs are categorized as known when their naturally occurring  or native  ligands have been identified 
scientists have used molecular cloning in combination with the sequencing of the human genome to identify both additional receptor subtypes of known gpcrs as well as hundreds of novel gpcrs 
these novel gpcrs are categorized as orphan gpcrs because their native ligands have not been identified 
we believe orphan gpcrs offer significant promise for the development of novel gpcr based therapeutics  and  therefore  are an important focus of our discovery research 
traditional ligand based drug screening methods require the time consuming identification and use of the receptor s native ligand to discover small molecule compounds that will bind at  or close to  the native ligand s binding site on the receptor 
in contrast  we have developed technologies that do not require the use of the native ligand 
instead  we are able to activate a gpcr so that the g protein signals without the presence of the native ligand by using cart and our other technologies 
applying our technologies to constitutively activate gpcrs assists in discovering drug like compounds by stimulating the gpcr to mimic the biological response that occurs when the native ligand binds to the receptor 
these technologies help avoid a major bottleneck in drug discovery efforts at orphan receptors by eliminating the step of first identifying the native ligand 
we have found that our constitutive activation technologies can be applied broadly to gpcrs 
our constitutive activation technologies allow us to simultaneously identify drug leads that act as receptor activators  or agonists  which increase the detected biological response  or act as receptor inhibitors  which decrease the detected response 
we can also identify inverse agonists  which inhibit ligand independent  as well as ligand dependent  receptor activity 
we believe that our constitutive activation technologies offer several key advantages for drug discovery over traditional screening techniques that require the use of the native ligand including not requiring prior identification of the native ligand for an orphan receptor  enhancing the detection of  and allowing us to simultaneously identify  both receptor inhibitor and receptor activator drug leads  allowing for the identification of drug leads that inhibit both ligand independent and ligand dependent activity  and providing the ability to discover novel and improved therapeutics directed at known receptors 
we use our constitutive activation technologies in combination with our patented melanophore technology 
our melanophore technology is a broadly applicable high throughput screen for gpcrs 
when a gpcr is activated either by a ligand or independent of a ligand through constitutive activation  the gpcr couples to one or more g proteins  including those belonging to the gs  gq  and gi o classes 
melanophore technology can detect gpcrs that couple to major g protein classes 
we believe our melanophore technology is  therefore  also well suited for studies of orphan receptors whose coupling parameters are unknown 
we believe melanophore technology provides us with a robust  reproducible  high throughput and low cost means for identifying and optimizing gpcr agonists  antagonists and inverse agonists  and is sensitive enough to detect the constitutive activity of many gpcrs 
our strategy the key elements of our scientific and business strategy are to advance our lead programs 
we intend to continue to advance our current drug candidates  with a partner or independently  through clinical development and  if successful  to commercialization 
discover and develop additional small molecule drug candidates targeting gpcrs 
we intend to continue to discover and develop orally bio available  small molecule compounds for gpcrs identified or validated through our research efforts 
focus on attractive market opportunities 
obesity  insomnia  diabetes  atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis each represent large market opportunities 
we intend to continue to focus on these and other markets with attractive commercial potential 
recognize significant economic value for our drug candidates under development 
we intend to maximize the value of our drug candidates through both independent development and licensing and other partnership opportunities with pharmaceutical and larger biotechnology companies 
continue to build our development capabilities 
to capitalize on our discoveries  we plan to continue to expand our clinical development capabilities as our drug candidates enter into  and move through  clinical trials 
maintain strong discovery research capabilities 
our proprietary technologies  our drug discovery infrastructure and the integrated approach to research used by our scientists  have allowed us to identify a number of gpcr targets and novel compounds 
we believe these and other discoveries will continue to fuel our pipeline 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  compounds and information  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements  licensing agreements and other agreements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as of january   we owned  in part or in whole  or had exclusively licensed the following patents in the united states  in japan  in germany  in france  in the united kingdom  in italy  in spain  in china  and approximately in other jurisdictions 
in addition  as of january   we had approximately patent applications before the united states patent and trademark office  foreign patent offices and international patent authorities 
these patents and patent applications are divided into distinct families of related patents that are directed to cart  melanophore technology  other novel screening methods  chemical compositions of matter  methods of treatment using chemical compositions  or gpcr genes 
one of our patent families was exclusively in licensed and contains a single issued patent 
eighty seven of our patent families  which include a total of about patents and patent applications  were invented solely by our employees 
the remaining of our patent families  which include a total of about patents and patent applications  were the subject of joint inventions by our employees and the employees of other entities 
there is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue  or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method 
except for the us patents relating to our melanophore technology  the term of most of our other current patents commenced  and most of our future patents  if any  will commence  on the date of issuance and terminate years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application 
since our us melanophore patents were issued under now superseded rules that provided a patent term of years from the date of issuance  the term of these patents are scheduled to end in because the time from filing to issuance of patent applications relating to our business is often more than three years  the resulting term of our pending patent applications  if any  on our drug candidates and technologies may be substantially less than years 
in the united states  europe and some other jurisdictions  patent term extensions are available for certain delays in either patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval processes 
however  due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions  there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval 
we seek patent protection for our key inventions  including clinical candidates and drug candidates we identify  routes for chemical synthesis  cart  new receptors that we discover  and genetically altered receptors 
it has generally been possible to obtain broad composition of matter patents on novel chemical compounds 
it has also generally been possible to obtain broad method patents for techniques and procedures for screening and drug identification technologies 
it has generally been more difficult to obtain broad composition of matter patents for nucleic acid and amino acid sequences 
however  it has been possible to obtain patents that protect specific sequences and functional equivalents of those sequences 
furthermore  intellectual property law allows for separate and distinct patents for novel  altered genetic sequences that have improved properties over previously disclosed sequences 
we believe that we can obtain patents on certain of our cart activated receptor sequences because they are not functional equivalents of the natural version of the receptor 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how  and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information  all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement  laboratory notebook policy  and invention disclosure protocol  as a condition of employment 
additionally  our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement requires that our employees not bring to us  or use without proper authorization  any third party proprietary technology 
we also require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us 
while such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf  they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change 
we face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing the same or similar technologies 
we also face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing drugs that would compete with the drug candidates we are developing 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations  which include many large  well financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies 
the focus of our scientific and business strategy is on gpcrs 
we believe that many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other organizations also have internal drug discovery programs focused on gpcrs 
in addition  other companies have attempted to overcome the problems associated with traditional drug screening by embarking on a variety of alternative strategies 
developments by others may render our drug candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
our present competitors with respect to lorcaserin include abbott laboratories  which markets sibutramine under the brand name meridia  and hoffmann la roche inc  the us prescription drug unit of the roche group  which markets orlistat under the brand name xenical 
also  glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare is marketing an over the counter low dose version of orlistat under the brand name alli in the united states 
another potential competitor is sanofi aventis  which markets rimonabant under the brand name acomplia in europe 
rimonabant is pending marketing approval in the united states 
in addition  we believe that there are potentially competing obesity programs that may be in development at various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including htc programs 
in addition to the marketed compounds described above under the apd discussion  neurocrine biosciences  inc and others are developing new gaba active compounds for the treatment of insomnia 
we believe sanofi aventis  eli lilly and company  and other companies are developing other potentially competing programs for insomnia  including programs targeting the hta receptor 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial  scientific and marketing resources than we do 
additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors 
as a result  our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research  development  marketing and promotion of drug discovery techniques or therapeutic products  or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval  or commercializing drugs before we do 
we expect to encounter significant competition for the principal drug candidates that we are developing 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drug candidates before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage 
furthermore  we may be competing against companies with substantially greater manufacturing  marketing  distribution and selling capabilities  and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use 
we may rely on our collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates 
our collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us  which may negatively impact the development of drugs that they discover that are subject to our agreements 
generally  our agreements with our collaborators do not preclude them from pursuing development efforts in one or more therapeutic areas of interest in which we have internal development efforts ongoing 
in addition  we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaborative arrangements  and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships 
government regulation we plan to develop and commercialize selected drug candidates by ourselves and license other candidates to partners for further development and commercialization 
our and our collaborators ongoing drug development activities are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the united states and other countries in which these drug candidates may be tested or in which drugs may be marketed 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate  is lengthy and uncertain 
before marketing in the united states  any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
moreover  the fda imposes substantial requirements on new product research and the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products  including preclinical testing and clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of these products 
in the united states  we are also subject to other federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including regulation of the use and care of laboratory animals 
in addition  the state of california imposes licensing requirements on facilities manufacturing drugs for clinical trials or for commercial market 
many other countries have similar requirements for testing  approval and marketing  including in the european union  or the eu 
before commencing clinical trial investigations in humans in europe  we and or our collaborators must submit the appropriate applications to applicable authorities in member countries 
before commencing clinical investigations in humans in the united states  we and or our collaborators must submit an investigational new drug  or ind  application to the fda 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase generally represents the initial administration of the drug candidate to a small group of either healthy volunteers or patients to test for safety and tolerability  absorption  distribution  metabolism  elimination and clinical pharmacology 
phase generally involves studies in patients to begin to assess the effectiveness of the drug candidate  to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse effects 
once a drug candidate is found to have some effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population  phase studies generally are initiated to establish safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical study sites 
the fda may require further post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies 
the fda reviews both the clinical plans and the results of the trials and we  our collaborators or the fda may decide that clinical trials should be discontinued at any time if any significant safety or other issues are identified 
clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board or ethics committee oversight  informed consent  good clinical practices and other fda or other regulatory authority oversight 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and is difficult to predict 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
additional factors that may cause delay  termination or increased cost of our or our collaborators clinical trials include  among other factors slow patient enrollment  the eligibility criteria for the study  competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates  lack of sufficient clinical supplies of the drug candidate  lack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested  adverse medical effects or side effects in treated patients  unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical studies  inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at a study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring the clinical trial  delays in approval from a study site s institutional review board  and longer treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or to determine the appropriate dose for the drug candidate 
if preclinical and clinical studies are successful  the results  together with other information about the drug candidate and its manufacture  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda to request marketing approval 
before receiving fda approval to market a drug candidate  we or our collaborators must demonstrate that the drug candidate is appropriately safe and effective through clinical trials in the patient population that will be treated 
the approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
additional animal studies or clinical trials may be requested during the fda review period that may delay marketing approval 
as part of the approval process  each manufacturing facility must be inspected by the fda 
among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform with federally mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
both before and after approval  manufacturers must expend time  money and effort to ensure compliance with cgmps  and the fda conducts periodic inspections to certify such compliance 
violations may result in the issuance of warning letters  restrictions on the drug or manufacturer  including costly recalls or withdrawal of the drug from the market  or other enforcement action 
if regulatory approval of a drug candidate is granted by the fda  this approval will be limited to those specific conditions for which the drug candidate  as demonstrated through clinical studies  has an appropriate safety and efficacy profile  as determined by the fda 
after fda approval for the initial indication  further clinical trials would be necessary to gain fda approval to use the drug for additional indications 
marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited 
the fda requires that adverse effects be reported to the fda and may also require post marketing surveillance or testing to monitor for adverse effects  which can involve significant expense 
even after fda approvals are obtained  a marketed drug is subject to their continual review and may include labeling requirements 
later discovery of previously unknown information or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a drug or withdrawal of the drug from the market  as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions 
furthermore  failure to obtain reimbursement coverage from governmental or third party insurers may adversely impact successful commercialization 
we have a chemical development facility that we are using for process research  the scale up and production of intermediates and other compounds for research and development purposes  and the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients  or api  for use in human clinical trials 
california law prohibits the shipment of a drug candidate or drug from a manufacturing facility in california for any clinical testing or commercial use prior to satisfaction of manufacturing licensing requirements 
our facility was inspected and licensed by the california department of health services and we believe it is in compliance with state regulatory requirements for the manufacture and distribution of api 
sources and availability of raw materials  intermediates  and clinical supplies we generally purchase raw materials  intermediates and clinical supplies from commercial sources 
substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources  so that  in general  the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us 
however  currently we have a primary source of supply for some key intermediates  api and finished drug products for our lead development projects 
the loss of a primary source of supply would potentially delay our lead development projects  lorcaserin  apd and apd  and potentially those of our collaborators 
compliance with environmental regulations we are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the controlled substances act and other present federal  state or local regulations 
we may be subject to further such regulations in the future 
our research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources 
our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a material effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
research and development expenses research and development activities  which include personnel costs  research supplies  facility and equipment costs and preclinical and clinical study fees  are the primary source of our expenses 
such expenses related to the development and improvement of our technology and drug candidates totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  research that was sponsored by our collaborators is included in our total research and development expenses 
we estimate that research expenses incurred on projects sponsored by our collaborators totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  employees as of february   we had a total of employees  including in research and development and in administration  which includes finance  legal  facilities and other general support areas 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors 
investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks described below  together with other information in this annual report on form k and other public filings  before making investment decisions regarding our common stock 
if any of the following events actually occur  our business  operating results  prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
moreover  the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business  operating results  prospects or financial condition 
risks relating to our business we will need additional funds to conduct our planned research and development efforts  and we may not be able to obtain such funds 
we had losses of million for the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit of million from our inception in april through december  our losses have resulted in large part from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and validate new drug targets and develop compounds that could become marketed drugs 
we expect that our operating expenses over the next several years will be significant and that we will continue to have significant operating losses for at least the next several years  even if we or our collaborators are successful in advancing our compounds or partnered compounds 
we do not have any commercially available drugs 
it takes many years and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to successfully develop a preclinical or early clinical compound into a marketed drug  and our efforts may not result in a marketed drug 
we have substantially less money than we need to develop a compound into a marketed drug 
additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on terms that you or we believe are favorable 
if additional funding is not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
our stock price could decline significantly based on the results and timing of clinical trials and nonclinical studies of  and decisions affecting  our lead drug candidates 
results of clinical trials and nonclinical studies of our lead drug candidates may not be viewed favorably by us or third parties  including investors  analysts and potential collaborators 
the same may be true of how we design the clinical trials of our lead drug candidates and regulatory decisions affecting those clinical trials 
biotechnology company stock prices have declined significantly when such results and decisions were unfavorable or perceived negatively or when a drug candidate did not otherwise meet expectations 
we have commenced a phase clinical trial program of our obesity drug candidate  lorcaserin  and a phase clinical trial of our insomnia drug candidate  apd results from these trials may be negative  may not meet expectations or may be perceived negatively 
the design of these trials which may change significantly and be more expensive than currently anticipated depending on our clinical results and regulatory decisions may also be viewed negatively by third parties 
we may not be successful in completing these trials on our projected timetable  if at all 
failure to initiate or delays in our clinical trials of lorcaserin  apd  apd  apd or any of our other drug candidates  or unfavorable results or decisions or negative perceptions regarding any of such trials  could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
clinical trials for our drug candidates are expensive  time consuming  uncertain and susceptible to change  interruption  delay or termination 
clinical trials are very expensive  time consuming and difficult to design and implement 
even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable  we estimate that the clinical trials of our most advanced drug candidates  including those being developed by our collaborators  will continue for several years and may take significantly longer than expected to complete 
in addition  the us food and drug administration  or fda  other regulatory authorities  our collaborators  or we may suspend  delay or terminate our clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including lack of effectiveness of any drug candidate during clinical trials  side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues  slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment or lower than expected patient retention rates  delays or inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or compound formulation  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a study  or clinical holds  or delays requiring suspension or termination of a study by a regulatory agency  such as the fda  after a study is commenced  changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulations  delays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites  uncertainty regarding proper dosing  unfavorable results from ongoing clinical trials and preclinical studies  failure of our clinical research organizations to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or otherwise fail to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  failure to construct appropriate clinical trial protocols  insufficient data to support regulatory approval  inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols  or difficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment  which may result in incomplete data 
there is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials  and many companies have experienced significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials 
we may experience similar setbacks in our clinical trials 
if we or our collaborators abandon or are delayed in our development efforts related to lorcaserin  apd  apd  apd or any other drug candidate  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our operations at the current level or become profitable  our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged  it may not be possible to complete financings  and our stock price would likely decrease significantly 
our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation  and we may not receive required regulatory approvals for our drug candidates 
the clinical development  manufacturing  labeling  packaging  storage  record keeping  advertising  promotion  export  marketing and distribution  and other possible activities relating to our drug candidates are  and any resulting drugs will be  subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory agencies in the united states 
neither our collaborators nor we are permitted to market our drug candidates in the united states until we receive regulatory approval from the fda 
neither our collaborators nor we have received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates 
specific preclinical data  chemistry  manufacturing and controls data  a proposed clinical study protocol and other information must be submitted to the fda as part of an ind application  and clinical trials may commence only after the ind application becomes effective 
to market a new drug in the united states  we must submit to the fda and obtain fda approval of a new drug application  or nda 
an nda must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data  as well as extensive information regarding chemistry  manufacturing and controls to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate 
we do not expect any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts to be commercially available for several years  if ever 
our most advanced drug candidates  including lorcaserin and apd  have not completed the large  pivotal phase clinical trials for efficacy and safety that are required for fda approval 
also  we have not previously filed ndas with the fda  nor have we previously conducted large scale phase clinical trials  which are significantly larger and more complex than earlier stage trials 
this lack of experience may impede our ability to successfully complete these trials and obtain fda approval in a timely manner  if at all  for our drug candidates for which development and commercialization is our responsibility 
even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising  such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda or any other us or foreign regulatory authority 
as a result  we cannot predict when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any drug we develop 
our business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates 
in order to market any drugs outside of the united states  we and our collaborators must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries 
approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with fda approval as well as additional  presently unanticipated  risks 
regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another  but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects associated with regulatory approval in the united states  including the risk that our drug candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed 
the results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results  and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials 
preclinical studies and phase and phase clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate  but rather to test safety  to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  and to understand the drug candidate s side effects at various doses and schedules 
to date  long term safety and efficacy have not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our drug candidates 
favorable results in our early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials  including continuing preclinical studies and large scale clinical trials  and our drug candidates in later stage trials may fail to show desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier stage trials 
in particular  preclinical data and the limited clinical results that we have obtained for lorcaserin and apd may not predict results from studies in larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations treated for longer periods of time 
they also may not predict the ability of lorcaserin or apd to achieve or sustain the desired effects in the intended population or to do so safely 
unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays  modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials 
preclinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed  repeated or terminated 
in addition  we may report top line data from time to time  which is based on a preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data  and is subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the applicable clinical trial 
our development of lorcaserin may be adversely impacted by cardiovascular side effects previously associated with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine 
we have developed lorcaserin to more selectively stimulate the htc serotonin receptor because we believe this may avoid the cardiovascular side effects associated with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine  two serotonin releasing agents and non selective serotonin receptor agonists  both of which were withdrawn from the market in after reported incidences of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension associated with their usage 
we may not be correct in this belief  however  or lorcaserin s selectivity profile may not avoid these undesired side effects 
moreover  the potential relationship between the activity of lorcaserin and the activity of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine may result in increased fda regulatory scrutiny of the safety of lorcaserin and may raise potential adverse publicity in the marketplace  which could affect clinical enrollment or ultimately sales if lorcaserin is approved for sale 
many of our research and development programs are in early stages of development  and may not result in the commencement of clinical trials 
many of our research and development programs are in the discovery or preclinical stage of development 
the process of discovering compounds with therapeutic potential is expensive  time consuming and unpredictable 
similarly  the process of conducting preclinical studies of compounds that we discover requires the commitment of a substantial amount of our technical and financial resources and personnel 
we may not discover additional compounds with therapeutic potential  and any of the compounds for which we are conducting preclinical studies may not result in the commencement of clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that results sufficiently favorable to justify commencement of phase studies will be obtained in these preclinical investigations 
if we are unable to identify and develop new drug candidates  we may not be able to maintain a clinical development pipeline or generate revenues 
the technologies on which we rely may not result in the discovery or development of commercially viable drugs or could become obsolete 
our gpcr technologies include technologies that allow us to discover drug like compounds that act on receptor subtypes of known gpcrs and novel gpcrs where the native ligands have not been identified 
these methods of identifying  prioritizing and screening molecular targets are unproven  and may not result in the regulatory approval and commercialization of any therapeutic products 
we do not believe that there are any drugs on the market that have been discovered or developed using our proprietary technologies 
if we are unable to identify additional drug candidates using our proprietary drug discovery technologies  we may not be able to maintain a clinical development pipeline or generate revenues 
another company  organization or individual could have  or could develop  a technology targeting gpcrs to discover and develop compounds into drugs more effectively or efficiently than our screening and other technologies 
such a technology could render our technologies  in particular our constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart  and melanophore technology  obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we are not successful in achieving milestones under our collaborations or in advancing our programs  we may have to curtail some of our activities 
we may not be successful in achieving additional milestones under our niacin receptor agonist collaboration with merck or our diabetes collaboration with ortho mcneil or in developing or partnering lorcaserin or apd or any of our other more advanced programs 
if we do not receive additional funding from partners  we will need to raise capital through the capital markets or by licensing some or all of our programs on financial terms that are unfavorable to us 
also  without additional capital or funding from partners  we would need to re evaluate our strategy of moving multiple drug discovery and development programs forward while at the same time maintaining our research and discovery capabilities 
based on such evaluation  we may need to significantly curtail some of our current and planned programs and expenditures 
we do not know what programs  if any  we would need to curtail  but we believe narrowing our pipeline would reduce our opportunities for success 
our revenues depend upon the actions of our existing and potential collaborators 
our revenues were million for the year ended december  we expect that  for at least the next few years  our revenues will depend upon the success of our existing collaborations and on our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we will receive little additional revenues from our existing collaborators if our own or our collaborators research  development or  ultimately  marketing efforts are unsuccessful  or if our agreements are terminated early 
typically  our collaborators and not us control the development of compounds into drugs after we have met early preclinical scientific milestones 
in addition  we may not have complete access to information about the results and status of our collaborators clinical trials and regulatory programs and strategies 
we are not entitled to the more significant milestone payments under our agreements until our collaborators have advanced compounds in clinical testing 
our partners may not devote adequate resources to the development of our compounds and may not develop or implement a successful clinical or regulatory strategy 
only two of our partners  merck and ortho mcneil  have advanced our drug candidates into clinical testing and paid us the applicable milestone payments 
we cannot guarantee that any other development  approval or sales milestones in our existing or future collaborations will be achieved  or that we will receive any payments for the achievement of any future milestones 
for the year ended december   of our revenues were from our collaborations with merck and ortho mcneil 
absent any new collaborators  we expect all of our revenues for to be derived from our collaborations with merck and ortho mcneil 
our revenues will be materially impacted if our agreement with either merck or ortho mcneil is terminated  our collaborators do not devote their time and financial resources to develop compounds under our collaborations  our collaborators dispute whether we have achieved a milestone  rights to a particular receptor or compound  or other terms of our agreements  our collaborators use alternative technologies to our technologies and compete with us in developing drugs  or our collaborators experience failures in the discovery or development of compounds identified with our technologies or in the clinic or marketplace with other products that cause them to discontinue or slow down our collaboration 
our ability to enter into new collaborations depends on the outcomes of our preclinical and clinical testing 
we do not control these outcomes 
in addition  even if our testing is successful  pharmaceutical companies may not partner with us on terms that we believe are acceptable until we have advanced our drug candidates into the clinic and  possibly  through later stage clinical trials  if at all 
our collaboration agreements with merck and ortho mcneil may be terminated in certain circumstances 
the term of our amended collaborative research program with merck is until october  merck can terminate this program i for technical grounds  by giving days prior notice  if both merck and we agree that technical grounds have occurred  or ii in the event of our change in control as defined in the agreement  by giving days prior notice 
technical grounds include circumstances where our joint research committee a committee comprised of an equal number of merck and our representatives concludes that a a significant adverse event affecting all the targets  all program compounds and all active compounds under the program has arisen during the conduct of the program  or b continuation of the program is no longer scientifically promising because the role of all the targets proves incorrect  or none of the targets are valid as a suitable target for development of a pharmaceutical product  or merck s patent department  upon consultation with our patent attorneys  makes a reasonable determination that valid third party patent rights block the achievement of significant program goals 
in addition  either party can terminate the agreement if the other party breaches its material obligations under the agreement by causes and reasons within its control  has not cured such breach within days of receiving a letter requesting such cure  and there is no dispute as to whether such breach has occurred 
in lieu of terminating the agreement  however  merck can terminate the research program and certain other aspects of the agreement after giving days prior notice if we materially breach our obligations during the course of the program and fail to cure such breach  if such default cannot be cured within such day period  or if we do not commence and diligently continue good faith efforts to cure such default during such period 
the term of the research program under our agreement with ortho mcneil is until december  we and ortho mcneil each have the right to terminate the agreement early if the other party commits an uncured material breach of its obligations 
further  ortho mcneil may terminate the agreement without cause during the term of the research program  provided that in such event it pays us the balance of its research funding obligation for the initial term of the research program in a lump sum  unless the termination is due to a change of control of arena as defined in the agreement  in which case ortho mcneil may terminate either the agreement or the research program under the agreement without the payment of additional research funding to us 
at any time after the end of the research program  ortho mcneil may terminate the agreement by providing us at least days prior written notice 
upon termination of the agreement  all rights to the compounds developed under the collaboration will revert to us 
we may have conflicts with our prospective  current or past collaborators that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our drug candidates 
we may have conflicts with our prospective  current or past collaborators  such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data  the achievement of milestones  or the ownership of intellectual property 
if any conflicts arise with ortho mcneil  merck or any other prospective  current or past collaborator  such collaborator may act in a manner that is adverse to our interests 
any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following  each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our drug candidates  and in turn prevent us from generating revenues unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to pay us research funding  milestone payments or royalties that we believe are due to us under a collaboration  uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities  which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations  unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities  or slowing or cessation of a collaborator s development or commercialization efforts with respect to our drug candidates 
drug discovery and development is intensely competitive in the therapeutic areas on which we focus 
if our competitors develop treatments that are approved faster  marketed better or demonstrated to be more effective or safer than our drug candidates  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
we focus our efforts on gpcrs 
because gpcrs are an important target class for drug discovery efforts  we believe that many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other organizations have internal drug discovery programs focused on gpcrs 
many of the drugs that our collaborators or we are attempting to discover and develop would compete with existing therapies 
in addition  many companies are pursuing the development of new drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater research and development capabilities and greater financial  scientific and human resources than we do 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do for the same indication may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights 
in addition  our competitors may develop drugs with fewer side effects  more desirable characteristics such as route of administration or frequency of dosing or greater efficacy than our drug candidates or drugs  if any  for the same indication 
any results from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with our existing or any future collaborators  may not compete successfully with existing or newly discovered products or therapies 
setbacks and consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  and our or our collaborators inability to obtain third party coverage and adequate reimbursement  could make partnering more difficult and diminish our revenues 
setbacks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as those caused by safety concerns relating to high profile drugs like vioxx and celebrex  or drug candidates such as torcetrapib  as well as competition from generic drugs  litigation  and industry consolidation may have an adverse effect on us 
for example  pharmaceutical companies may be less willing to enter into new collaborations or continue existing collaborations if they are integrating a new operation as a result of a merger or acquisition or if their therapeutic areas of focus change following a merger 
moreover  our and our collaborators ability to commercialize future drugs will depend in part on government regulation and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payers  including government payers  such as the medicaid and medicare programs 
government and third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs 
these efforts may limit our commercial opportunities by reducing the amount a potential collaborator is willing to pay to license our programs or drug candidates in the future due to a reduction in the potential revenues from drug sales 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all 
in the course of our discovery  preclinical testing and clinical trials  we rely on third parties  including laboratories  investigators  clinical research organizations and manufacturers  to perform critical services for us 
for example  we rely on contract clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials for lorcaserin and apd clinical research organizations are responsible for many aspects of the trials  including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials 
these third parties may not be available when we need them or  if they are available  may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner 
these independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
as a result of our dependence on third parties  we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control 
these risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators  and we do not control our collaborators research and development  clinical trials or regulatory activities 
we do not expect any drugs resulting from our collaborators research and development efforts to be commercially available for many years  if ever 
we or a third party manufacturer may encounter failures or difficulties that could delay the clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates  or their ultimate commercial production if approved 
we and third parties manufacture our drug candidates 
should we obtain fda approval for any of our drug candidates  we expect to rely  in whole or in part  on third party manufacturers for commercial production 
any performance failure on the part of us or a third party manufacturer could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
we or third party manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields  regulatory compliance  quality control and quality assurance  as well as shortages of qualified personnel 
approval of our drug candidates could be delayed  limited or denied if the fda does not approve our or a third party manufacturer s processes or facilities 
manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda  the drug enforcement administration of the us department of justice  or dea  and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over a third party manufacturer s compliance with these regulations and standards 
if one of our manufacturers fails to maintain compliance  the production of our drug candidates could be interrupted or suspended  or our product could be recalled or withdrawn  resulting in delays  additional costs and potentially lost revenues 
we may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity  increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management 
from time to time we consider strategic transactions  such as acquisitions of companies  asset purchases and out licensing or in licensing of compounds or technologies 
additional potential transactions we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements  including spin offs  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  restructurings  divestitures  business combinations and investments 
any such transaction may require us to incur non recurring or other charges  may increase our near and long term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business  which could harm our operations and financial results 
our efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees 
our success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management  development and scientific personnel  and the ability to hire and retain key personnel  particularly in the clinical development area as we transition more of our programs from research into drug development 
we face intense competition for such personnel 
the loss of services of any principal member of our management or scientific staff  particularly jack lief  our president and chief executive officer  and dominic p 
behan  phd  our senior vice president and chief scientific officer  could adversely impact our operations and ability to raise additional capital 
to our knowledge  neither mr 
lief nor dr 
behan plans to leave  retire or otherwise disassociate with us in the near future 
we may encounter significant delays or problems with our chemical development facility 
we have a chemical development facility for process research  scale up and production of intermediates and other compounds for research and development purposes  and production of active pharmaceutical ingredients for use in clinical trials 
we may encounter delays and problems in operating our chemical development facility due to governmental approvals  permits and regulation of the facility  accidents during operation of the facility  failure of equipment for the facility  delays in receiving raw materials from suppliers  natural or other disasters  or other factors inherent in operating a complex manufacturing facility 
we may not be able to operate our chemical development facility in a cost effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs 
if this were to occur  we would need to seek alternative means to fulfill our manufacturing needs  which could delay progress on our programs 
we use biological materials  hazardous materials  chemicals and radioactive compounds 
our research and development activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment 
these materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our facility pending ultimate use and disposal 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination  which could cause interruption of our research and development efforts  injury to our employees and others  environmental damage resulting in costly clean up  and liabilities under federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
in such an event  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we carry insurance in amounts and type that we consider commercially reasonable  we cannot be certain that the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate and we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research and development efforts caused by contamination 
we may incur substantial liabilities from any product liability claims if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate 
we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in clinical trials  and will face an even greater risk if we sell drugs commercially 
an individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our drug candidates or drugs causes  or merely appears to have caused  an injury 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against a product liability claim  we will incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our drug  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial subjects  costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to subjects or other claimants  loss of revenues  and the inability to commercialize our drug candidates 
we have limited product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of drugs if marketing approval is obtained for any of our drug candidates 
however  insurance coverage is increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost  and we may not have insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 
our operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event 
our laboratories  offices and chemical development facility are located in the same business park in san diego 
we depend on our facilities and on our collaborators  contractors and vendors for the continued operation of our business 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  power interruptions  wildfires and other fires  actions of animal rights activists  earthquakes and wars could disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators  contractors and vendors 
even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance  and our contractors may carry liability insurance that protect us in certain events  we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage 
for example  we are not insured against a terrorist attack 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results 
moreover  any such event could delay our research and development programs 
new accounting pronouncements may impact our future results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement  which became effective for us on january  and changed how we account for share based compensation  will negatively impact our results of operations and may negatively impact our stock price 
through december   we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we generally did not recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants we issued under our equity compensation plans or the discounts provided under our employee stock purchase plan 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior period results are not restated 
compensation expense recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but unvested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
sfas no 
r may also delay when we may become profitable 
future changes in us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition  might have a significant effect on our reported results  including reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of such pronouncements 
even if any of our drug candidates receives regulatory approval  our drug candidates will still be subject to extensive post marketing regulation 
if we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates  we will also be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory review  such as continued adverse event reporting requirements 
we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations  all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such drugs 
if any of our drug candidates receive united states regulatory approval  the fda may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses for which such drugs may be marketed or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post approval studies 
in addition  regulatory agencies subject a drug  its manufacturer and the manufacturer s facilities to continual review and inspections 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured  may result in restrictions on the marketing of that drug  up to and including withdrawal of the drug from the market 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in issuance of warning letters by the fda  imposition of fines and other civil penalties  criminal prosecutions  injunctions  suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses  suspension of any ongoing clinical trials  suspension of manufacturing  delays in commercialization  refusal by the fda to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our collaborators  refusals to permit drugs to be imported to or exported from the united states  restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  and product recalls or seizures 
the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates or further restrict or regulate post approval activities 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our drugs and our business could suffer 
laws  rules and regulations relating to public companies may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers 
laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and by the nasdaq global market  may result in increased costs to us 
these laws  rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these laws  rules and regulations 
risks relating to our intellectual property our success is dependent on intellectual property rights held by us and third parties and our interest in these rights is complex and uncertain 
our success will depend on our own and on our collaborators abilities to obtain  secure and defend patents 
in particular  the patents directed to our most advanced drug candidates and other compounds discovered using our technologies or that are otherwise part of our collaborations are important to commercializing drugs 
we have numerous us and foreign patent applications pending for our technologies  including patent applications on drug lead discovery techniques using cart  genetically altered gpcrs  gpcrs that we have discovered  new uses for previously discovered gpcrs  and compounds discovered using cart and melanophore and other technologies 
the procedures for obtaining a patent in the united states and in most foreign countries are complex 
these procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many sophisticated legal issues 
obtaining patent rights outside the united states often requires the translation of highly technical documents and an improper translation may lead to the loss of  or otherwise jeopardize  the patent protection of our inventions 
ensuring adequate quality of translators and foreign patent attorneys is often very challenging 
consequently  the process for having our patents issue will be difficult  complex and time consuming 
our patent position is very uncertain and we do not know when  or if  we will obtain additional patents for our technologies  or if the scope of the patents obtained will be sufficient to protect our drugs 
in addition  other entities may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and patent applications in litigation or administrative proceedings 
even the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
we cannot make assurances as to how much protection  if any  will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them or they are challenged 
it is possible that a competitor or a generic pharmaceutical provider may successfully challenge our patents and those challenges may result in reduction or elimination of our patents coverage 
there is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue  or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant technology or method  or that the patents will be held to be valid for their expected terms 
in  the united states patent and trademark office began issuing broad patent claims that could allow patent holders to control the use of all drugs that modulate a particular drug target or gpcr  regardless of whether the infringing drug bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing 
we believe that the question of whether these new patent claims are valid is controversial and the subject of litigation 
whether we or our competitors are able to obtain and enforce such patent claims  particularly as they apply to the gpcrs that are the subject of our drug development activities  may have a significant impact on our potential revenues from any drugs that we are able to develop 
we also rely on confidentiality agreements and trade secrets to protect our technologies 
however  such information is difficult to protect 
we require our employees to contractually agree not to improperly use our confidential information or disclose it to others  but we may be unable to determine if our employees have conformed or will conform to their legal obligations under these agreements 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with prospective collaborators  collaborators  service providers and consultants  but we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of this information 
many of our employees and consultants were  and many of them may currently be  parties to confidentiality agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the use of our technologies could violate these agreements 
in addition  third parties may independently discover our trade secrets or proprietary information 
some of our academic institution licensors  research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights 
we generally seek to prevent our partners from disclosing scientific discoveries before we have the opportunity to file patent applications on such discoveries 
in some of our collaborations we do not have control over our partners ability to disclose their own discoveries under the collaboration and in some of our academic collaborations we are limited to relatively short periods to review a proposed publication and file a patent application 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired 
a dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays in our research and development activities 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to develop and manufacture our drug candidates and market and sell drugs  if any  and conduct our research and development activities without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
there are many patents and patent applications filed  and that may be filed  by others relating to drug discovery and development programs that could be determined to be similar  identical or superior to ours or our licensors or collaborators 
we may be exposed to future litigation by others based on claims that our drug candidates  technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
numerous united states and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the area of gpcrs  including some which purport to allow the patent holder to control the use of all drugs that modulate a particular drug target or gpcr  regardless of whether the infringing drug bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing 
numerous united states and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in  and for the therapeutic targets for  which we are developing drugs 
these could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or sell drugs  and our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be determined to infringe these patents 
because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending applications  unknown to us  which may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates or technologies may infringe 
there also may be existing patents  of which we are not aware  that our drug candidates or technologies may infringe 
further  there may be issued patents and pending patent applications in fields relevant to our business  of which we are or may become aware  that we believe we do not infringe or that we believe are invalid or relate to immaterial portions of our overall drug discovery and development efforts 
we cannot assure you that others holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seeking to enjoin our activities 
we also cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  we will be able to successfully assert any belief we may have as to non infringement  invalidity or immateriality  or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor 
in addition  others may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights against others 
other organizations  companies and individuals are seeking proprietary positions on genomics information that overlap with the government sponsored project to sequence the human genome 
our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be affected by conflicting positions that may exist between any overlapping genomics information made available publicly as a result of the government sponsored project and genomics information that other organizations  companies or individuals consider to be proprietary 
there could also be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry that affect us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
any legal action or administrative action against us  or our collaborators  claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our drug discovery and development programs could require us  or our collaborators  to obtain a license to continue to use  manufacture or market the affected drugs  methods or processes  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  prevent us from importing  making  using  selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages  consume a substantial portion of our managerial  scientific and financial resources  or be costly  regardless of the outcome 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of pre trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we have been contacted from time to time by third parties regarding their intellectual property rights  sometimes asserting that we may need a license to use their technologies 
if we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our technologies  we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our drug candidates 
we cannot protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
filing  prosecuting and defending patents on all of our drug discovery technologies and all of our potential drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive 
competitors may use our technologies to develop their own drugs in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection 
these drugs may compete with our drugs  if any  and may not be covered by any of our patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements 
in addition  many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may have limited remedies  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
compulsory licensing of life saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives 
such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our drug candidates  which could limit our potential revenue opportunities 
moreover  the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or pharmaceuticals  which makes it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
risks relating to our securities our stock price will likely be volatile  and your investment in our stock could decline in value 
our stock price has fluctuated historically 
from january  to february   the market price of our stock was as low as per share and as high as per share 
very few drug candidates being tested will ultimately receive fda approval  and biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies may experience a significant drop in stock price based on a clinical trial result or regulatory action 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly depending on a variety of factors  including the success or failure of  or other results or decisions affecting  our clinical trials  the timing of the discovery of drug leads and the development of our drug candidates  the entrance into a new collaboration or the modification or termination of an existing collaboration  the timing and receipt by us of milestone and royalty payments or failing to achieve and receive the same  changes in our research and development budget or the research and development budgets of our existing or potential collaborators  the introduction of new drug discovery techniques or the introduction or withdrawal of drugs by others that target the same diseases and conditions that we or our collaborators target  regulatory actions  expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights or other matters  and accounting changes  including the expense impact of sfas no 
r 
we are not able to control all of these factors 
if our financial or scientific results in a particular period do not meet stockholders or analysts expectations  our stock price may decline and such decline could be significant 
holders of our series b preferred can require us to redeem their series b preferred 
on december   we completed a private placement of i  shares of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred  ii seven year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to weighted average adjustment in certain circumstances and iii unit warrants to purchase million of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred the series b preferred and the series b preferred are collectively referred to as the series b preferred  and additional seven year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to weighted average adjustment in certain circumstances 
on april   the investors exercised their unit warrants in full 
the holders of our series b preferred can require us at any time to redeem all or some of their shares of series b preferred at such shares stated value  plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment and any applicable penalties 
the stated value is the original holder s investment plus any dividends settled by increasing the stated value at the time the dividend is payable 
the aggregate redemption price of our series b preferred at december  was approximately million  and accrues interest at annually 
the holders of our series b preferred will be entitled to require us to redeem their shares of series b preferred at such shares stated value  plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment and any applicable penalties if  in the future  the average of the closing prices of our common stock for any consecutive trading days is below per share  which is the conversion price for the series b preferred 
the aggregate redemption price of our series b preferred at december  was approximately million  and accrues interest at annually 
also  the holders of the series b preferred may require us to redeem their shares if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents for an effective net price to us per share less than approximately excluding  among other things  certain common stock and common stock equivalents issued or issuable i to our officers  directors  employees or consultants  ii in connection with certain strategic partnerships or joint ventures  and iii in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
effective net price is not defined in the certificate of designations governing our series b preferred 
the holders of our series b preferred may assert that effective net price should be calculated as the amount we receive after paying any discounts and other expenses related to any such issuance 
at the option of any holder of any series b preferred  any series b preferred held by such holder may be converted into common stock based on the applicable conversion price then in effect for such shares of series b preferred 
in addition to the foregoing redemption rights  at any time following the occurrence of a triggering event  a holder of the series b preferred may require us to repurchase all or any portion of the series b preferred then held by such holder at a price per share equal to the greater of of the stated value or the market value as calculated under the certificate of designations for the series b preferred and the series b preferred of such shares of series b preferred plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment 
triggering event is specifically defined in the certificate of designations for the series b preferred and the series b preferred  and includes any of the following events i immediately prior to a bankruptcy event  ii we fail for any reason to timely deliver a certificate evidencing any securities to a purchaser or the exercise or conversion rights of the holders are otherwise suspended for other than a permissible reason  iii any of certain events of default as set forth in the registration rights agreement with the series b preferred holders occur and remain uncured for days  iv we fail to make any cash payment required under the series b preferred transaction documents and such failure is not timely cured  v the issuance of a going concern opinion by our independent registered public accounting firm that is not timely cured  vi we breach a section of the series b preferred purchase agreement relating to indebtedness and subordination  or vii we default in the timely performance of any other obligation under the series b preferred transaction documents and such default is not timely cured 
we will also be required to redeem any shares of the series b preferred that remain outstanding on the fifth anniversary of their issuance at a price equal to the amount of the original holder s original investment  plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of such payment 
if we are required to redeem all or some of the currently outstanding shares of our series b preferred  we may be able to pay a portion of the redemption price using shares of our common stock if certain enumerated conditions are satisfied  including we have sufficient number of shares of common stock available for issuance  the shares of common stock to be issued are registered under an effective registration statement or are otherwise available for sale under rule k under the securities act of  as amended  or securities act  our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market or other eligible market  the shares to be issued can be issued without violating the rules of the nasdaq global market or any applicable trading market or a provision of our certificate of designations for the series b preferred  and no bankruptcy event has occurred 
if we are permitted to satisfy a portion of a redemption by using shares of our common stock  and if we elect to do so  the number of shares to be issued to holders of series b preferred will be determined by dividing their cash redemption price by the lesser of the conversion price or of the average of the volume weighted average price of our common stock for either or trading days 
there can be no assurance that if we have to redeem our series b preferred  that we will be able to pay a portion of the redemption price using shares of our common stock 
if we use common stock to redeem a portion of the series b preferred  your ownership interest may be significantly diluted 
if we are required or elect to redeem shares of the series b preferred using cash  we may not have sufficient cash to redeem these shares or to continue our planned research and discovery activities 
in such event we may try to raise additional capital by issuing new stock  but there can be no assurance that capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market  and the sale of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
there were  shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  the outstanding shares of our series b preferred are convertible into up to  shares of common stock at per share of common stock 
the outstanding shares of our series b preferred are convertible into up to  shares of common stock at per share of common stock 
holders of series b preferred are entitled to receive a annual dividend that is payable by issuing common stock or by increasing the amount of common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred 
in connection with the series b preferred financing  we issued warrants to acquire  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the two purchasers in our series b preferred financing 
as of february    of such warrants are outstanding 
such warrants provide that if the closing price of our common stock is equal to or above per share for consecutive trading days  upon trading days prior written notice  we will have the right to  and the warrant holders will have the right to require us to  call and cancel any unexercised portion of the warrants subject to certain conditions 
following such a call notice  we would be obligated to issue to the warrant holder an exchange warrant entitling the holder to purchase shares of our common stock equal to the call amount as such term is defined in the warrants 
this exchange warrant would contain the same terms and conditions as the original warrant  except that the maturity date would be seven years from the date of issuance of such exchange warrant and the exercise price would be equal to of the average of the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the five trading days preceding the original warrant cancellation date 
on march   following our call notice to one of our two warrant holders  smithfield fiduciary llc  such holder exercised its warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in connection with this exercise in full of its warrants  smithfield claimed that it was entitled to receive exchange warrants that would include a provision that could require us to issue additional exchange warrants in the future 
we disagreed with this interpretation and  on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with smithfield 
as part of the settlement agreement and release  a smithfield and we provided each other with a release of any claims relating to i smithfield s demand for  and our non issuance of  exchange warrants  and ii any breach or default under certain of our agreements on account of the foregoing  b we issued smithfield a seven year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share  and c we filed a registration statement covering the sale of the shares of common stock issuable under the new warrant 
the new warrant does not contain any right for us  or for the holder to require us  to call the warrant  nor does it provide the holder the right to receive any exchange warrants in the future 
in addition  as of february   there were  options to purchase shares of our common stock issued and outstanding under our equity incentive plans at a weighted average exercise price of   performance unit awards outstanding under our long term incentive plan   additional shares of common stock issuable under our long term incentive plan   shares of common stock issuable under our employee stock purchase plan  as amended  and  shares of common stock issuable under our deferred compensation plan 
a substantial number of the shares described above  when issued upon exercise  will be available for immediate resale in the public market 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of such resales due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
any future equity or debt issuances by us may have dilutive or adverse effects on our existing stockholders 
we have financed our operations  and we expect to continue to finance our operations  primarily by issuing and selling our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
in light of our need for additional financing  we may issue additional shares of common stock or additional convertible securities that could dilute your ownership in our company and may include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to yours 
moreover  any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the terms of our series b preferred limit our ability to engage in certain equity issuances 
we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt  and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws 
the terms of our series b preferred limit our ability to incur debt 
our largest stockholders may take actions that are contrary to your interests  including selling their stock 
a small number of our stockholders hold a significant amount of our outstanding stock 
these stockholders may support competing transactions and have interests that are different from yours 
sales of a large number of shares of our stock by these large stockholders or other stockholders within a short period of time could adversely affect our stock price 
we may have disagreements with our warrant holders 
we previously had a disagreement with one of our two warrant holders regarding whether such holder was entitled to receive exchange warrants following the exercise of its warrants in full 
although we entered into a settlement agreement and release with this holder  we may have a similar dispute with the other warrant holder 
moreover  we may be involved with other disagreements with our warrant holders in the future 
such disagreements may lead to litigation which may be expensive and consume management s time  or involve settlements  the terms of which may not be favorable to us 
provisions of our series b preferred may prevent or make it more difficult for us to raise funds or take certain other actions 
provisions of our series b preferred require us to obtain approval of the preferred stockholders  or otherwise trigger rights of first refusal or payment provisions  to i offer or sell new securities  other than in specified underwritten offerings or strategic partnerships or joint venture and certain other exceptions  ii sell or issue common stock or securities issuable into common stock below certain prices  iii incur debt or allow liens on our property  other than certain permitted debt and liens  iv amend our certificate of incorporation so as to affect adversely any rights of the preferred stockholders  v authorize or create a new class of stock that will be senior or equal to the series b preferred in terms of dividends  redemption or distribution of assets  or vi take certain other actions 
these provisions may make it more difficult for us to take certain corporate actions and could delay  discourage or prevent future financings 
our rights agreement and certain provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest 
we have adopted certain anti takeover provisions  including a stockholders rights agreement  dated as of october   between us and computershare trust company  inc  as rights agent  as amended 
the rights agreement will cause substantial dilution to any person who attempts to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights agreement and certificate of designations for the series b preferred  as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under delaware law  could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interest 
for example  these provisions allow our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  limit who can call a special meeting of stockholders  eliminate stockholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at stockholders meetings
