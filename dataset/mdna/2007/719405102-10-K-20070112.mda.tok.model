item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended october   october  and october  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits ics and flat panel displays fpds 
further  photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company s selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry s migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products produced using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor or fpd sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized ics  a reduction in design complexity or other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing semiconductors or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or fpd designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and fpds increases 
further  advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the global semiconductor industry is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications for high performance semiconductor devices  including  but not limited to communications and mobile computing solutions 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry s transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company s ability to remain successful in these environments is based upon achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader  an efficient solutions supplier  and a company able to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
as of december  state of the art for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer for ics  and generation to generation process technologies for fpds  while nanometer is being moved into volume production 
and above nanometer and generation through generation process technologies for fpds constitute the majority of high performance designs being fabricated in volume today 
the company expects there to be an increase in nanometer designs moving to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business through investments in manufacturing process and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
in and  the company has experienced growth in demand for fpd photomasks  which it currently supplies from its facility in korea and from its new facility in taiwan  which was completed in as of december  the company completed construction of its manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  for which it is expected to complete certain tool installations and customer qualifications  and begin production in the second quarter of the company s fiscal year 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific ics 
through fiscal  the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
additionally  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
through fiscal  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies  due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices asps 
to meet the technological demands of its customers and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing capability both at existing and new facilities 
the company s cash payments for capital expenditures for new facilities and equipment to support its customers requirements for high end technology products aggregated approximately million for the three fiscal years ended october   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
based on the anticipated technological changes in the industry  the company expects these trends to continue 
in  the company invested million in the mp mask joint venture  and technology license and related agreements  and will continue to invest in advanced technologies 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive due to the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network and employees  which consists of nine manufacturing sites and another facility scheduled to begin production in the company s second quarter of fiscal  represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins  or result in write offs from asset impairments 
the vast majority of photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger for ics  and generation technologies or lower for fpds 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
semiconductor fabrication also occurs below nanometer for ics  and generation and above for fpds 
the company is capable of producing a selective range of photomasks at still smaller geometries  and has begun accelerating its efforts to support the development and production of photomasks for  and nanometer technology nodes in semiconductors and generation in fpd 
however  as is typical of industries in the midst of technological change  some of the company s competitors may be able to achieve higher manufacturing yields than the company when producing these smaller geometry photomasks  in part because these competitors may have completed more cycles of learning than the company in this area and in part because of the company s need to replicate production of these complex photomasks at its four advanced technology locations worldwide  and at the mp mask facility 
on may   photronics and micron entered into the mp mask joint venture  which develops and produces photomasks for leading edge and advanced next generation semiconductors 
as part of the formation of the joint venture  micron contributed its existing photomask technology center located at its boise  idaho headquarters to mp mask and photronics paid micron million on the date of closing and will pay micron an additional million on each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing date in exchange for a interest in mp mask and a license for photomask technology of micron and certain supply agreements 
photronics and micron have started construction of an independent state of the art nanofab facility the new nanofab in boise  idaho  for volume production of advanced technology photomasks 
the new nanofab will be constructed by micron  equipped and operated by photronics and is subject to a lease purchase in favor of photronics  its cost is estimated to be in the range of to million 
photronics total investment in the purchase and equipping of the new nanofab is expected to fall within a range of million to million and may include redeployment of some existing photronics assets 
this new nanofab is expected to be completed and to begin production in the first half of fiscal in march of  the company implemented a restructuring program to streamline its operating infrastructure in north america 
the program included the closing of the austin  texas manufacturing and research and development center and the relocation of certain development and manufacturing work to other facilities within the global network 
the company incurred total restructuring charges of million in its fiscal year ended october  the austin  texas facility is currently available for sale and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet with a net carrying value of million at october  the company does not anticipate any further significant restructure expenditures in fiscal related to the closure of its austin  texas facility 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended october  october  october  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges operating income interest expense investment and other income  net income before income tax provision and minority interest income tax provision minority interest net income note all the following tabular comparisons  unless otherwise indicated  are for the fiscal years ended october   october  and october   in millions of dollars 
net sales percent change to to fpd ic total net sales net sales for increased to million as compared to fiscal year  due principally to increased sales of fpd photomasks  as a result of increased consumer demand for fpd applications 
this increase was somewhat mitigated by decreased sales of ic photomasks of as a result of reduced demand for mainstream ic photomasks 
total sales of high end photomasks  which include fpd and ic  increased to in as compared to in fpd revenue for increased to million as compared to million in high end technology applications typically have higher asps  for both ic and fpd photomasks 
high end photomask applications include mask sets for semiconductor designs at and below nanometer for ics  and for fpd products using g and above technologies 
by geographic area  compared to  net sales in asia increased million or  north american sales decreased million or  and european sales increased million or 
net sales for fiscal year increased to million as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in sales primarily relates to increased sales of fpd photomasks as a result of increased consumer demand for fpd applications  and to a lesser extent  an improved mix of sales of high end ic photomasks driven by increased design releases in for devices using advanced semiconductor applications 
during  the company s high end sales mix improved to approximately of sales  from approximately of sales in as a result  the company s asps improved during as high end photomasks typically have higher asps 
while the company experienced increased unit demand for high end photomasks in  mainstream unit demand declined as a result of reduced units for mainstream ic photomasks  which are defined as nanometer and above 
by geographic area in  net sales in asia increased million or  europe increased million or  and north america decreased million or 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin gross margin decreased slightly to of net sales for as compared to in as a result of the company s increased infrastructure and expanded manufacturing capability which includes increased high end ic manufacturing capability and increased fpd capacity  principally with the opening of the taiwan fpd facility 
the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and to the extent that the company s revenues and utilization increase or decrease  gross margin will generally be positively or negatively impacted 
the gross margin percentage for fiscal could be negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense associated with the company s recent capital expenditures  principally in asia  and with the redeployment of the tools from its austin  texas facility 
gross margin was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the gross margin did not experience an increase in fiscal that would typically result from increased revenue as compared to the prior year 
this was primarily due to increased infrastructure costs incurred to expand the company s manufacturing base  primarily related to additional costs of equipment and production capability in asia 
gross margin was also negatively impacted during by reduced unit volumes of mainstream ic photomasks 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expense of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to  primarily due to the company s expanded asian infrastructure  which includes expansion in shanghai  china and taichung  taiwan  and increased stock compensation expenses of million related to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased modestly by in as compared to during  the company experienced increased start up costs associated with the company s expansion in asia  primarily related to the company s taiwan fpd and china facilities and sarbanes oxley compliance 
these costs were somewhat mitigated by reduced salaries and wages in the united states and europe 
research and development percent change to to r d expense to net sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions for ic and fpd technologies 
research and development expenses decreased in as compared to as a result of cost savings associated with the closure of the company s austin  texas research and technology operations  which were in part offset by amortization expenses of the fair value of the agreement to license technology from micron 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to continued expenditures relating to high end process technologies 
consolidation  restructuring and related charges in the second quarter of  the company implemented a plan to streamline its operating infrastructure in north america by ceasing the manufacture and research and development of photomasks at its austin  texas facility 
the company recorded total restructuring charges of million in  primarily comprised of million related to the impairment of facilities and equipment and other and million relating to workforce reductions of approximately employees in the united states 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume continues to grow in asia 
this ongoing assessment could result  in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be predicated by market conditions and customer requirements 
the following tables set forth the company s restructuring reserves as of october   october   and october  and reflect the activities affecting the reserves for the years ended year ended october  october  october  balance charges utilized balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended october  october  october  balance charges utilized balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended october  november  october  balance charges utilized balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total as of october   manufacturing capacity reduction and other of million primarily represents non cancelable lease obligations that are due under the respective lease terms through other income expense interest expense investment and other income  net total other expense interest expense increased in as compared to due to increases in interest rates as the company s interest rate swap contract effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
investment and other income increased in as compared to primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of million in as compared to million in  net realized gains on the sales of certain investments of million in as compared to million in  and interest income of million in as compared to million in further  investment and other income  net  for includes early extinguishment charges of million relating to the redemption of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense decreased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of reduced year over year average outstanding debt 
investment and other income  net  increased in as compared to as a result of increased investment income from higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  increased grant income and foreign currency gains 
income tax provision income tax provision effective income tax rate the company s operations have followed the recent migration of semiconductor industry fabrication to asia  where the company operates in countries where it is accorded favorable tax treatments 
the company is accorded tax holidays in taiwan  one of which expired in december and the other is expected to expire in december in addition  the company has been accorded a tax holiday in china which is expected to expire in in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  was million or of pretax income  which differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of tax holidays in taiwan  available tax credits in korea and valuation reserves on tax losses generated in the united states primarily due to restructuring costs incurred in the united states 
the company s tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future examinations and has provided accruals for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  was million on a pre tax income of million 
similarly  the provision differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of taiwan s and singapore s tax holidays  available tax credits in korea  and valuation reserves on losses generated in the united states 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
the valuation allowance increased by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the availability of tax holidays in some asian jurisdictions did not have a significant impact on the company s decision to close some of its north american facilities nor in the company s increased asian presence which is in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest expense  which represents the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea  was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in minority interest expense is due to the increased ownership of the company s subsidiary in korea  which is offset in part by increased earnings of these subsidiaries in the company s ownership in its subsidiary in korea was on october   on october  and at october  the company s ownership in its subsidiary in taiwan was at october   october  and october  the company increased its ownership in its subsidiary in korea from to at october  for cash of approximately million  and further increased its ownership to in for cash of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources october  october  october  in millions in millions in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities the company s working capital decreased million to million as of the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal this was a result of million in cash invested in the mp mask joint venture and related technology license and supply agreements with micron  and the classification of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes due in december of to current liabilities from long term debt 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at october  were million compared to million at october  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during was primarily due to the million payment for the investment in mp mask and related technology license and supply agreements with micron  million cash payments for capital expenditures  and an additional million invested in pk  ltd 
in in july of  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
net of underwriting fees and other offering costs  the company s net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to higher accounts receivable balances and decreases in accounts payable and accruals for items other than capital expenditures and accrued payments related to the company s investment with micron 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal increased to million  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of the initial payment of million to micron technology  inc for the investment in mp mask and related technology license and supply agreements  million of capital expenditures  and million additional investment in pkl 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects cash based capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million to million  primarily to continue the expansion of its high end ic and fpd technical capabilities 
in  cash provided by financing was million  which is primarily a result of net proceeds from long term debt of million to support the start up of the new facility in china 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million which consists of million net proceeds from the company s public stock offering  less the million redemption of the company s subordinated notes and repayment of million of other borrowings 
the company believes that its currently available resources  together with its capacity for growth and its accessibility to debt and equity financing sources  are sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company paid the million net carrying value of its convertible subordinated notes in december from its cash reserves 
the company s commitments represent investments in additional manufacturing capacity as well as advanced equipment for the production of high end  more complex photomasks 
at october   the company had commitments outstanding for capital expenditures of approximately million 
additional commitments for capital requirements are expected to be incurred during fiscal cash requirements the company s cash requirements in fiscal will be primarily to fund operations  including spending on capital expenditures  mp mask commitments  and debt service  as well as any cash acquisitions that it may undertake 
in addition  its million net carrying value of its convertible subordinated notes were repaid in december the company expects that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash and short term investments 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of october  in millions payments due total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases capital lease unconditional purchase obligations total certain transactions the company has a ownership interest in the mp mask joint venture that was established in with micron 
since the company does not control this venture  the company does not consolidate the results 
as part of the joint venture  various supply agreements exist between the company  micron  and mp mask 
as of october   the company owed mp mask million and had a receivable from micron of million 
during  the company recognized net revenue of million related to commissions earned under supply agreements between the company  micron and mp mask  comprised of gross commission income of million less million of amortization of the value of the supply agreement intangible asset 
the gross commission revenue includes million in orders from micron less the company s cost of the corresponding orders placed with mp mask in the amount of million 
in addition  in the company incurred outsourcing expenses of million from mp mask for research and development activities purchased by the company 
the chairman of the board of the company is also the chairman of the board and majority shareholder of a company who is a supplier of secure managed information technology services 
another director of the company is also an employee  shareholder and executive vice chairman of this company 
since  the company has entered into various service contracts with this company to provide services to all of the company s worldwide facilities

subsequently  compensation expense is recognized in its consolidated statements of income  over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
the stock based compensation cost that has been charged against income in was million  substantially all of which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
no compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory  and no income tax benefit was recorded in as of october  the total compensation cost related to non vested option and restricted stock awards not yet recognized is approximately million 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average amortization period of years 
business outlook a majority of the company s revenue growth has come from  and is expected to continue to come from  the asian region as customers increase their use of manufacturing foundries located outside of north america and europe 
additional revenue growth is also anticipated from north america and europe as a result of utilizing technology licensed under the company s technology license with micron technology  inc the company s korean and taiwanese operations are non wholly owned subsidiaries  therefore a portion of earnings generated at each location is allocated to the minority shareholders 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume continues to grow in asia 
in addition to the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of relating to closing the austin facility  this ongoing assessment could result in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be based on market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this filing involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
various factors that have been discussed and a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  different reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period that they are determined 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet net of related debt  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income oci loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must meet certain criteria and be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
the company uses judgment in assessing the fair value of derivatives and related financial instruments including assumptions utilized in derivative fair value models in such areas as projected interest rates and bond prices which are affected by changes in the company s stock price during the contract term 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
actual fair values may differ from estimated fair values 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles 
these assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis or some other method which more fairly represents the utilization of the assets 
the future economic benefit of the carrying value of all intangible assets is reviewed annually and the company uses judgment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on discounted cash flows or market factors and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined see note 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of consolidated financial statement income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required if realization is not likely by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
accordingly  the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company makes estimates and assumptions and uses judgment relating to discounts and estimates for product return and warranties  which are accrued and recognized at the time of sale 
discounts sales discounts are negotiated with customers prior to billing and at the time of billing  sales invoices are prepared net of negotiated sales discounts 
product returns customer returns have historically been insignificant 
however  the company does record a liability for the immaterial amount of estimated sales returns based upon historical experience 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specifications 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of revenue recognition  a liability is established for these items 
customer acceptance customer acceptance occurs concurrently with the transfer of title and risk of loss based upon the applicable shipping and delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to use considerable judgment in estimating the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events  and historical experience 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r on october   using the modified prospective method 
subsequently compensation expense is recognized in its consolidated statements of income  over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
the company recognizes expense for all stock based compensation with graded vesting granted on or after october  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
for awards with graded vesting granted prior to october   the company continues to recognize compensation cost over the vesting period following accelerated recognition as if each underlying vesting date represented a separate award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company adopted the alternative transition method provided in fasb staff position no 
r for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
the company estimates stock price volatility based on weekly averages of its historical volatility over a term approximately equal to the grant s estimated option life 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
effect of new accounting standards in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize in its statement of financial condition the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation 
sfas no 
also requires an entity to recognize changes in the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plan directly to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  to the extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as components of periodic net benefit cost 
sfas no 
is effective for companies with fiscal years ending after december  the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
 however does not believe the impact of its adoption will be material to its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas no 
may have on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the company s balance sheets and statements of operations  and the related financial statement disclosures 
the sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
the company is currently evaluating sab no 
 however  it does not believe the impact of its adoption will be material to its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the provisions are effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
the company is evaluating the impact  if any  this statement may have on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas no 
permits fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instruments that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
as of october   the company did not have any hybrid financial instruments subject to the fair value election under sfas no 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company does not engage in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the statement of operations or as accumulated oci loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract  which effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
contract payments are made on a libor based variable rate at october  and are received at the fixed rate 
the interest rate swap contract is used to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates 
this contract is considered to be a hedge against interest rate risk of the company s fixed rate debt obligation 
accordingly  the contract has been reflected at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheets and the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
in addition  changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the contract  as well as offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the net effect of this accounting on the company s operations results is that the interest expense portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on variable rates 
at this time  the company does not have plans to enter into additional interest rate swap contracts  however  at a future point the company may decide to do so 
this swap expired in december when the company repaid the remaining outstanding balance of its convertible subordinated notes see note 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  operating margins and retained earnings 
the principal functional currencies of the company s asian subsidiaries are the korean won  new taiwan dollar and singapore dollar 
the principal functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are the british pound and euro 
the company attempts to minimize its risk to foreign currency transaction losses by producing its products in the same country in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital 
in some instances  the company may sell products in a currency other than the functional currency of the country where it was produced 
to date  the company has not experienced a significant foreign exchange loss on these sales 
however  there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s primary net foreign currency exposures as of october  included the korean won  singapore dollar  the new taiwan dollar  the euro  and the british pound 
as of october   a adverse movement in the value of these currencies against the us dollar would have resulted in a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
the company does not believe that a change in the exchange rates of other non us dollar currencies would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april   the company s korean subsidiary entered into a foreign currency rate swap contract 
under the terms of the contract  the company has effectively converted a million interest bearing intercompany loan denominated in us dollars to korean won 
this contract was initially scheduled to expire in december  however  it has been extended to the company elected not to designate the foreign currency rate swap contract as a hedge which results in a market to market adjustment in the income statement 
in september   the company entered into forward contracts to convert the fixed yen purchase price of certain equipment into fixed us dollar amounts 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash flow and are evaluated for effectiveness 
the company records these derivative instruments in either other current assets or non current assets or accrued liabilities  depending on their net position  at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognized in earnings or in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated oci or loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting as defined by sfas no 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s borrowings at october  were in the form of its two convertible subordinated notes with fixed interest at rates of and  and certain unsecured international notes payable which bear interest at rates ranging from and at october   and ranging from to at october  the million net carrying value of its convertible subordinated note was repaid by the company in december in addition  the interest rate swap contract discussed above subjects the company to market risk as interest rates fluctuate on the million notional amount of the contract 
at october   and october   the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in net variable rate financial instruments which were sensitive to interest rate risk 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in either or
