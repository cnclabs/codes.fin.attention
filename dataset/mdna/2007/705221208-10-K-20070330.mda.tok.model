item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information elsewhere in this form k 
overview peco ii  inc was organized in for the purpose of acquiring the assets of itt s communications power product business 
today  we provide solutions to our telecommunications customers through a variety of products and services in order to meet their cost  quality  productivity and capacity challenges 
as part of this process  we design and manufacture communications specific power products 
we also provide on site e i  systems integration  installation  maintenance  and monitor services to our customers 
our power systems provide a primary supply of power to support the infrastructure of communications service providers  including local exchange carriers  long distance carriers  wireless service providers  internet service providers and broadband access providers 
our power distribution equipment directs this power to specific customer communications equipment 
our systems integration business provides complete built to order communications systems assembled and installed pursuant to customer specifications and incorporating other manufacturers products 
market conditions remain uncertain and difficult 
in the recent past  several of our customers have engaged in mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  such as sbc acquiring at t  at t acquiring bell south and cingular  alltel acquiring western wireless  and sprint acquiring nextel 
also  both sprint nextel and alltel spun off their local wireline businesses to focus on their core wireless businesses 
currently  major wireline companies are focusing their capital expenditure spending on fttc fiber to the curb and fttn fiber to the node for both broadband and video services distribution  while wireless companies are focusing their capital expenditure spending on migration of acquired systems to the standards of the acquiring carrier  integrating networks  improving area coverage  deploying g data services and have begun to announce plans to deploy wimax networks 
while the telecommunications market is extremely volatile  capital expenditure spending has expanded by the mid single digits in and analysts have projected further growth in and we believe this growth forecast provides us with an opportunity to capitalize on our customers capital expenditure plans 
in  we targeted the capital expenditure growth in the wireless market 
we successfully ramped the product which was created to serve the wireless base station market  including both cabinet and hut applications  to volume production 
the was well received by the market  and is standardized at wireless operators 
the acquisition of delta products north american business added more cell site power solutions to our portfolio 
the hds product provides customers with either v or v operation using a horizontal distribution architecture 
customer preferences for distribution architecture vary by region  so the hds offers a true complement to the vertical style used by peco ii plants 
between the two  we are positioned to offer the right solution regardless of customer preference 
we introduced another mid size plant  the fd  to a variety of wireline service providers 
the product is designed to serve small central offices or remote wireline sites such as controlled environment vaults and shelters 
we initiated field trials with four major carriers in our r d investment extended beyond traditional cell site applications 
we modified our e inverter system to address a specific application at a major wireline carrier 
we also assimilated the hds large office power system from the delta acquisition 
this true phase power solution positions usi to provide solutions for wireline central offices and wireless mobile switching centers 

table of contents our services group focused on hardening our solution portfolio to meet the power needs of our tier customer base 
these activities provided first office application foa opportunities at four new wireline wireless carrier markets 
two of the successful foas different tier carriers resulted in peco ii receiving a direct award of their markets cell site power installation needs for the remaining portion of our services division continues to provide engineering and installation services for all major power product brands 
this capability is both respected and valued in the marketplace 
our strong power e i services reputation has provided many opportunities for introducing new power products as well as a real user feedback channel on deployed products 
this feedback continues to aid us with designing and improving products to meet the industry evolving needs 
looking forward  we will continue to focus our efforts on delivering the service solutions our customers have come to expect from working with peco ii 
this dedication has enabled us to minimize customer turn over to a minimum 
we will continue to expand our services footprint on those opportunities that make the best utilization of our current available resources  and or those that position us for success as our industry matures to the next level 
critical accounting policies accounting in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition product revenues are recognized when customer orders are completed and shipped  title passes to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales sometimes include multiple items including services such as installation 
in such instances  product revenue is not recognized until installation is complete and the product is made available for customer use 
service revenues on engineering and installation contracts and the costs for services performed are primarily recorded as the work progresses on a percentage of completion basis 
management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing sales 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which include intangible assets  goodwill  and plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following sustained underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  their physical condition or the strategy for the company s overall business  negative industry or economic trends  declines in stock price of an investment for a sustained period  the company s market capitalization relative to net book value  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit  or a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  unanticipated competition  and a loss of key personnel 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
product and service goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indications arise 
in prior years  only the service segment had goodwill and was tested annually 
on march   peco ii acquired exclusive rights to certain business and inventory for delta s us and canadian telecom power division in exchange for an equity position in peco ii that enables delta to become the company s largest shareholder 
additionally  the transaction included the execution of a supply agreement that allows peco ii to access delta s substantial engineering capabilities and high quality  cost effective component manufacturing for its power systems 
as a result of this transaction  the october  goodwill valuation review also included the product segment 
during the fourth quarter of each year  the company performs the annual impairment test for goodwill which did not result in any impairment for and the tests were performed at the reporting unit level using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
in performing the tests for impairment  we made assumptions about future sales and profitability that required significant judgment 
in estimating expected future cash flows for the test  we used internal 
table of contents forecasts that were based upon actual results and modest cost and gross margin improvement 
the most critical estimates used in determining the expected future cash flows were the revenue and cost assumptions and the terminal value assumed 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower the carrying values of each of the product and service reporting units would exceed the expected future cash flows and would have resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill for both segments 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
inventory costs consist of purchased product  internal and external manufacturing costs  and freight 
management regularly reviews inventory for obsolescence or excessive quantities and records an allowance accordingly 
various factors are considered in making this determination  including recent usage history  forecasted usage and market conditions 
during  the company identified several specific products in which market current replacement cost was less than cost 
management evaluated the products and determined that the current replacement cost will be sustained due to continued competitive market conditions 
therefore  the company recognized a loss of for the write down of cost to market and is reflected in product cost of goods sold in the accompanying statement of operations 
management believes that the new value on these products is reflective of a net realizable value reduced by an allowance for a normal profit margin 
we continually review the inventory for obsolescence or excessive quantities and accrue accordingly 
at a minimum  all part numbers are reviewed quarterly 
should a part number have no usage for a year  we will reserve of the standard cost for those part numbers which will reduce the total gross inventory value 
in addition  we review for excesses and reserve a percentage as appropriate of standard costs for any excesses that are greater than the last twelve month usage or two times future six month requirements  whichever is greater 
for  upon further review of our excess quantities  we determined that our reserve on excesses was not sufficient 
this created a million inventory change in estimate 
the same formula will continue to be used to determine the excesses quantities  but we will now reserve of these quantities 
for  the obsolescence reserves increased by thousand 
the increase was due primarily to the thousand of excess inventory from the million of delta inventory purchased as part of the acquisition 
we anticipated customer orders for these parts at the time of the acquisition but the orders never materialized due to overall slowing of the industry 
we also reviewed the inventory costs  per the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
upon completion of the review  we are comfortable that there are no abnormal idle facility costs  freight or handling costs in the inventory valuation 
sfas no 
also requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production statement for fiscal year sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted this statement in and recognized a write down of after a thorough review of all inventory costs 
we again reviewed fixed costs at the end of and determined there were minor changes resulting in minimal adjustments 
deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the taxable entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment 
table of contents transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
we previously accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no share based employee compensation cost for stock options was recognized in consolidated net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the company recognizes share based compensation expense during the vesting period of each award 
generally  stock options with a vest schedule of three years are expensed based upon a graded vesting schedule of during the first year  during the second year and during the third year 
at december   there was thousand of unrecognized compensation expense from non vested options that is expected to be recognized prior to december  at december   there was thousand of unrecognized compensation expense from non vested restricted stock awards that is expected to be recognized during results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items and the percentage of net sales from our consolidated statement of operations

table of contents years ended december  operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative impairment of service segment goodwill real estate impairment loss from operations loss from joint venture loss from operations after joint venture interest income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in the first two quarters of  the company experienced growth in line with the rest of the industry  while the remainder of the year we experienced a significant downturn in customer orders 
we believe this downturn was the result of mergers and consolidations that continue in the telecom industry 
net sales in our product segment increased by million  with the result being million for the year ended december  as compared to million for year ended december  the upward trend resulted from increased orders from a major wireless carrier along with the additional revenues from the delta acquisition 
as of december   our product backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  had decreased to million from million at december  this decrease further reflects the decrease in firm orders received in the second half of net sales in our service segment increased by million  resulting in million for year ended december  as compared with million for year ended december  the service revenue increase was primarily due to the addition of a new region awarded by a major wireless customer 
as of december   our service backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  was million remaining flat with prior year 
gross margin 
gross margin dollars decreased million to million in as compared to a million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in the product gross margin decreased to million in as compared to which had million 
the decrease in product gross margin included new and ongoing events  which included supply agreement amortization costs resulting from the delta transaction of thousand  and several one time events  which included delta transition acquisition costs of thousand  outsourcing inventory and fixed asset impairments of thousand  additional excess and obsolescence reserves of thousand  specific product lower of cost or market write down of thousand  and an additional thousand of additional warranty costs 
in addition  we recognized thousand of unabsorbed factory productions costs as a result of the decrease in orders 
gross margin as a percentage of product sales decreased to in  which includes the 
table of contents adjustments above  compared to a in if the one time events were eliminated our gross margin would have seen an improvement over the service segment gross margin decreased to million in as compared with the million in service gross margin as a percentage of sales was in as compared to in the decrease in margin was primarily attributed to a new job outside of the united states mainland that required additional startup costs and a high learning curve 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of thousand 
as a percentage of net product sales  research  development and engineering expense decreased to in from in this percentage decrease was due to the increased sales volume along with decreased expense 
many of the projects completed in had already incurred the majority of the expense in resulting in a decrease of research and development expenses in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased to in from in this percentage increase was due to recognition of stock based compensation expense of thousand  non capitalized due diligence costs of thousand  amortization of customer relationship costs due to delta transaction of thousand  investment in the development of a manufactures representative group within our sales organization  and additional compensation costs 
interest income 
interest income  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in of this amount  interest expense was thousand in compared to thousand in the increase in interest income  net  in the current year was due primarily to additional cash invested from the sale of our manufacturing facility and the increase in interest rates on investments offset by decreased interest expense from due primarily to the payoff of certain long term debts during income taxes 
as a result of our significant continued operating losses in recent years  we determined a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required 
as such  our effective income tax rate was in  compared to an effective rate of in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was in line with the telecom growth that the industry had experienced in the wireless carriers provided of our revenues in as compared to of revenues in net sales in our product segment increased by million  with the result being million for the year ended december  as compared to million for year ended december  the upward trend we recognized in the product segment has continued through as our customers have further increased their capex spending 
net sales in our service segment increased by million  resulting in million for year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  again the increase was a reflection of the telecom industry increase in capex spending 
as of december   our service backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  was million  remaining flat with december  gross margin 
gross margin dollars increased million to million in as compared to a million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to in compared to in 
table of contents the product gross margin increased to million in as compared to which had million 
the increase in product sales volume was the primary attribute in the increased product gross margin as the volume increase has a positive impact on absorption

service gross margin as a percentage of sales was in as compared to in research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of thousand 
as a percentage of net product sales  research  development and engineering expense decreased to in from in this percentage decrease was due to the increased sales volume 
the research  development and engineering expense increase was largely due to the focus on growth in the wireless market and the development on midsize products 
the majority of these new products require network equipment building standards nebs testing as specified by our customers 
this testing was very expensive  which impacted our r d expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of thousand 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to in from in this percentage decrease was due to increased sales volumes 
interest income 
interest income  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in of this amount  interest expense was in as compared to thousand in the increase in interest income  net  in the current year was due primarily to the increase in interest rates on investments offset by an increase in interest expense primarily from the increase in the line of credit balance during income taxes 
as a result of our significant continued operating losses in recent years  we determined a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required 
as such  our effective income tax rate was in  compared to an effective rate of in liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs for the foreseeable future will be for working capital and operations 
as of december   available cash and cash equivalents approximated million 
based on available funds and current plans  management believes that the company s available cash  borrowings and amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next months 
the assumptions underlying this belief include  among other things  that there will be no material adverse developments in the business or market in general 
there can be no assurances however that those assumed events will occur 
if management s plans are not achieved  there may be further negative effects on the results of operations and cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
working capital was million at december   which represented a working capital ratio of to  compared to million at december  our investment in inventories and accounts receivables was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in inventory was due primarily to the delta acquisition and the million of inventory received as a part of the transaction 
our capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our budgeted capital expenditures for is million as we remain focused on conserving cash 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at days at december   as compared to days at december  at december   inventory days on hand  which represents gross inventory excluding impairments or reserves  were days  as compared to days on hand at december  cash flows used by operating activities were million in  slightly higher than cash flows used by operating activities of million in this use of cash was primarily the result of operating losses along 
table of contents with increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accounts payable 
we saw positive inflow of cash from investing activities resulting from the sale of the new manufacturing facility in galion 
from financing activities  we also had a positive inflow from the use of the credit line along with proceeds resulting from the exercise of options and issuance of stock from the employee stock purchase plan 
we have an agreement with national city bank to provide all banking services and a million line of credit 
as collateral for the line of credit  the company established a million deposit account with the bank 
the balance of the restricted cash at national city bank is million 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flow from operations  and our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we do not currently plan to pay dividends 
on february   the company received notice from the nasdaq stock market that the company s stock price was below the minimum per share requirement 
if compliance is not regained by august   the company may face potential delisting from the nasdaq market which could limit the company s ability to raise additional capital as needed in the future 
we have capital lease agreements for machinery and office equipment that expire in future minimum annual lease payments required during the year ending is  we have operating leases covering certain office facilities  and equipment that expire at various dates through future minimum annual lease payments required during the years ending in through under non cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year are   and  respectively

impact of new accounting standards during  the company early adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs  this statement clarifies the accounting for idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material to ensure that these types of costs are treated as current period charges 
sfas also requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production 
management performed a thorough review of inventory costs and recognized a write off of inventory costs of for overheads in excess of normal capacity 
the loss per common share impact of this change in accounting principle  assuming no dilution  was

during  the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires the quantification of misstatements based on their impact to both the balance sheet and statement of operations to determine materiality 
the guidance provides for a one time cumulative effect adjustment to correct for misstatements for errors that were not deemed material under a prior approach but are material under the sab approach 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin establishes that the financial statement effects of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be adopted by the company on january  the company has completed its analysis of the effects of fin and has determined the adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which applies under most other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas provides a common definition of fair value 
the new standard also provides guidance on the methods used to measure fair value and requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and will be adopted by the company on january  the company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows

item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency fluctuations 
we have not entered into interest rate or foreign currency transactions 
our foreign currency exposure was immaterial as of december   and our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our revolving line of credit facility 
we had million borrowings under this facility at december  we currently do not hedge our exposure to floating interest rate risk 
we believe a rate increase would have a minimal impact upon our net loss 
during  our net loss would have been negatively impacted by approximately thousand by a increase in our revolving line of credit interest rate
