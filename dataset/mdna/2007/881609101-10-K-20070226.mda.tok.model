item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
business strategy and overview our strategy is to create a value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a low cost structure  iii effective management information systems and iv outstanding employees focused on achieving operational excellence in a global market in order to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 
our goals are focused on i operating our facilities in a safe  reliable  and environmentally responsible way  ii improving cash flow by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies  and iii using excess cash flows from operations in a balanced way to create further shareholder value 
during  we achieved the following significant results relative to our goals  which are further described below under results of operations and capital resources liquidity we had record net earnings of million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
our cash flows from operating activities were billion  an increase of million from we achieved average throughput of  barrels per day bpd  which was just below the  bpd record set in our capital and turnaround spending totaled million  including million for economic projects  and million for safety and reliability projects 
we posted the lowest recordable osha incident rate in our history 

table of contents we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling million or per share 
we repurchased million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program for million 
pending acquisitions on january   we entered into agreements with shell oil products us shell to purchase a  bpd refinery and a  bpd refined products terminal located south of los angeles  california along with approximately shell branded retail stations located throughout southern california collectively  the los angeles assets 
the purchase includes a long term agreement allowing us to continue to operate the retail stations under the shell brand 
the purchase price of the los angeles assets is billion  plus the value of petroleum inventories at the time of closing  which is estimated to be million to million based on january prices 
upon closing of the acquisitions shell has agreed  subject to certain limitations  to retain certain obligations  responsibilities  liabilities  costs and expenses  including environmental matters arising out of the pre closing operations of the assets 
we have agreed to assume certain obligations  responsibilities  liabilities  costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with decrees  orders and settlements the seller entered into with governmental and non governmental entities prior to closing 
this transaction  which will require regulatory approval from the federal trade commission and the attorney general of the state of california  is expected to be completed in the second quarter of we expect to realize synergies by optimizing the output of our refineries to maximize the production of clean fuel products for the california market as well as through our crude oil purchasing and unique shipping logistics 
in addition  we expect to increase reliability  throughput levels and the production of clean products at the refinery by spending approximately million to million between and we also plan to lower air emissions as well as improve fuel efficiency at the refinery by spending an additional million to million between and these cost estimates will be further reviewed and analyzed after the transaction is completed and we acquire additional information through operation of the assets 
on january   we entered into an agreement to purchase usa petroleum retail stations located primarily in california and a terminal located in new mexico 
the purchase price of the assets and the usa brand is million  plus the value of inventory at the time of closing  which is estimated to be million to million based on january prices 
tesoro will assume the obligations under the seller s leases  contracts  permits or other agreements arising after the closing date 
usa petroleum will retain certain pre closing liabilities  including environmental matters 
the acquisition will provide us with retail stations near our refineries in california that will enable us to run the refineries at full capacity  invest in refinery improvements and deliver more clean products into the market 
this transaction  which will require regulatory approval from the federal trade commission and the attorney general of the state of california  is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the acquisitions of the los angeles assets and the usa petroleum retail stations will be paid for with a combination of debt and cash on hand  which at december  was million 
the exact amount of debt and cash is yet to be determined  but our debt to capitalization ratio is expected to be less than at the time of closing 
we plan to reduce debt through internally generated cash flow and have set a goal to reduce our debt to capitalization ratio to by the end of strategic capital projects during we will continue to focus on capital projects that improve safety and reliability  enhance our crude oil flexibility  improve clean product yields and increase energy efficiency 
in december  our board of directors approved the capital budget  which is approximately million including refinery turnarounds and other maintenance costs of approximately million 
the capital budget does not include any capital spending for the pending acquisitions discussed above 
see capital resources and liquidity for additional information related to capital spending  including the estimated spending in for each of the capital projects described below 
golden eagle coker modification project the coker modification project at our golden eagle refinery is currently scheduled to be substantially completed during the first quarter of the modification of our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker unit will enable 
table of contents us to comply with the terms of an abatement order to lower air emissions while also enhancing the refinery s capabilities in terms of reliability  lengthening turnaround cycles and reducing operating costs 
by extending the typical coker turnaround cycle from years to years  we will effectively increase clean fuels production and significantly reduce the duration and costs of coker turnarounds 
washington sulfur handling projects our capital budget includes sulfur handling projects at our washington refinery which will allow us to process a greater percentage of sour crude oils beginning in the sulfur handling projects were a component of the  bpd delayed coker unit project at our washington refinery which was cancelled in july we estimate the sulfur handling projects will allow our washington refinery to capture up to of the original benefit of the delayed coker 
the delayed coker unit was designed to process a larger portion of lower cost heavy crude oils or manufacture a larger percentage of higher value refined products 
the project  originally estimated to cost approximately million  had experienced significant cost escalations in engineering  materials and labor and no longer met our rate of return objectives 
the cost escalations were similar to those that had been announced on other projects both within and outside the energy sector 
our decision to terminate the project is consistent with our commitment to high return projects 
the termination of the delayed coker project resulted in pretax charges of million in other strategic capital projects during the second quarter  we are scheduled to complete the following three strategic projects i a  bpd diesel desulfurizer unit at our alaska refinery  ii a process control modernization project at our golden eagle refinery  and iii a wharf expansion project also at our golden eagle refinery 
the diesel desulfurizer unit will allow us to manufacture ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd and become the sole producer of ulsd in alaska 
the control modernization project will convert our older refinery control technologies at the golden eagle refinery to a modern digital system 
the wharf expansion project will increase our crude oil flexibility by enabling us to supply all of the golden eagle refinery s crude oil requirements by water 
industry overview the global fundamentals of the refining industry remained strong during continued demand growth in developing areas such as india and china and global political concerns supported high prices for crude oil and refined products 
in the us  refining margins remained above historical levels during and improved as compared to  in part due to the following continued high gasoline and diesel demand coupled with limited production capacity  higher than normal industry maintenance during the first half of reflecting turnarounds which were postponed in due to hurricanes katrina and rita  the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for gasoline in january and diesel in june and the removal of mtbe as a blendstock nationwide  stronger reliance on gasoline imports  the extended downtime at three refineries damaged by the hurricanes and other incidents  and extensive industry maintenance and unplanned downtime on the us west coast during the fourth quarter 
anticipated lower overall crude oil and refined product prices  along with relative price stability  should lead to increases in refined product demand 
with little incremental refining capacity being added during the year  existing refineries will likely continue to run at high utilization levels and us refined product imports are expected to increase to meet rising demand requirements 
in addition  higher than normal maintenance schedules are planned during the first and second quarters  further reducing us supplies 
for all of these reasons  our outlook for the refining industry remains strong

d management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance  allocate resources and compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources 
manufacturing costs per barrel is calculated by dividing manufacturing costs by total refining throughput and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance 
these financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income  revenues  costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
e gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks  purchased refined products  transportation and distribution 
gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel  adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of refined product that is different than actual volumes manufactured 
the adjustment for changes in refined product inventory resulted in a decrease in gross refining margin of million in both and and million in gross refining margin also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market 
f includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately  and for  and  respectively 
g sources of total refined product sales included refined products manufactured at the refineries and refined products purchased from third parties 
total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products and the effects of inventory changes 
total refined product sales were reduced by thousand barrels per day mbpd in as a result of recording certain purchase and sales transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis beginning in the first quarter upon adoption of eitf issue no 
see note a of the consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
compared to operating income from our refining segment was billion in compared to billion in the increase in operating income of million was primarily due to increased gross refining margins  partially offset by higher depreciation expense and an increased loss on asset disposals and impairments 
total gross refining margins increased to per barrel in compared to per barrel in reflecting higher industry margins in all of our regions 
the higher industry margins reflect continued strong demand for refined products  limited production capacity in the us  a stronger reliance on gasoline imports and strong global economic growth 
during  certain factors further impacted industry refining margins  including the introduction of new sulfur requirements for gasoline and diesel  the elimination of mtbe  increased turnaround activity during the first half of and extensive turnaround activity on the us west coast in the fourth quarter 
see business strategy and overview for additional information and other factors impacting industry refining margins 
industry margins during the second half of were impacted due to production and supply disruptions on the us gulf coast caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions  particularly in our mid continent and pacific northwest regions 
in our mid continent region  gross refining margins increased to per barrel during from per barrel during  reflecting lower feedstock costs due to higher local crude production and strong diesel demand 
during  margins in our mid continent region were negatively impacted by certain factors primarily during the first quarter  including higher crude oil costs due to canadian production constraints and a depressed market in the salt lake city area due to record high first quarter production in padd iv 
gross refining margins in our pacific northwest region increased to per barrel in versus per barrel in despite a scheduled turnaround at our washington refinery during the fourth quarter 
margins were positively impacted by continued strong demand on the us west coast along with higher than normal industry maintenance and unscheduled refining industry downtime 
by comparison  certain factors negatively impacted our gross refining margins in during the first quarter  margins in our pacific northwest region were negatively impacted as our washington refinery completed a scheduled turnaround of the crude and naphtha 
table of contents reforming units and incurred unscheduled downtime of certain processing equipment 
in addition  our gross refining margins in our pacific northwest region during the first half of were negatively impacted as the increased differential between light and heavy crude oil depressed the margins for heavy fuel oils 
total refining throughput averaged mbpd in compared to mbpd during during  we continued to achieve near record throughput levels reflecting on going reliability and operating efficiencies due to recent scheduled turnarounds 
in addition  our on going process controls modernization programs at our golden eagle and washington refineries contributed to higher throughput during the second half of during  we experienced scheduled refinery turnarounds at our golden eagle  alaska  and washington refineries and unscheduled downtime at our north dakota refinery 
we also experienced reduced throughput at our alaska refinery during the first quarter as a result of the grounding of our time chartered vessel which impacted our supply of feedstocks to the refinery 
during  we experienced scheduled refinery turnarounds at our golden eagle  washington and hawaii refineries and other unscheduled downtime 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in from billion in  primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices  partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes 
our average refined product prices increased to per barrel reflecting the continued strength in market fundamentals

compared to operating income from our refining segment was billion in compared to million in the increase in operating income of million was primarily due to higher gross refining margins  combined with higher throughput levels  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
total gross refining margins increased to per barrel in compared to per barrel in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all our regions 
industry margins on a national basis improved during compared to  primarily due to the continued increased demand for refined products due to improved global economic performance  an active hurricane season and higher than normal industry maintenance particularly in the western united states during the first half of industry margins were also impacted by unplanned industry downtime on the us west coast during the third quarter 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins and increased total refining throughput 
total refining throughput averaged mbpd in compared to mbpd during  reflecting record high throughput during the third and fourth quarters 
our record high throughput during the last half of reflects improved operational efficiencies resulting from scheduled turnarounds at our three largest refineries during the first half of we estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by approximately million as a result of both scheduled and unscheduled downtime at our golden eagle and washington refineries during the first quarter 
during the third and fourth quarters  our golden eagle refinery experienced reduced throughput during a scheduled turnaround  in which we estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by approximately million 
in addition  our gross refining margins in our pacific northwest region during the first half of and the third and fourth quarters were negatively impacted as the increased differential between light and heavy crude oil depressed the margins for heavy fuel oils 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in from billion in  primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices combined with slightly higher refined product sales volumes

the purchase price for the usa petroleum retail stations is million plus the value of inventories at the time of closing which is estimated to be million to million based on january prices 
the acquisitions  which are subject to federal and state approvals  are anticipated to close in the second quarter 
we intend to finance the acquisitions using a combination of cash on hand and debt 
the exact amount of debt and cash is yet to be determined  but the debt to capitalization ratio is expected to be less than at the time of closing

we present ebitda because we believe some investors and analysts use ebitda to help analyze our cash flow including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to use cash for other purposes  including capital expenditures 
ebitda is also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance 
ebitda is also used by management for internal analysis and as a component of the fixed charge coverage financial covenant in our credit agreement 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings  earnings before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
our annual historical ebitda reconciled to net cash from operating activities was in millions net cash from operating activities changes in assets and liabilities excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements deferred income taxes stock based compensation loss on asset disposals and impairments amortization and write off of debt issuance costs and discounts depreciation and amortization net earnings add income tax provision less interest income and other add interest and financing costs operating income add depreciation and amortization add gain on partnership sale ebitda historical ebitda as presented above differs from ebitda as defined under our credit agreement 
the primary differences are non cash postretirement benefit costs and loss on asset disposals and impairments  which are added to net earnings under the credit agreement ebitda calculations 
capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending our capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending totaled million during  compared to million in as discussed below 

table of contents capital expenditures during  our capital expenditures  including accruals  totaled million  including refinery turnarounds and other maintenance spending of million 
capital expenditures at our golden eagle refinery included million for the delayed coker modification project  million for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping  and million for control systems modernization 
during  we also spent million for the diesel desulfurizer unit at our alaska refinery  million for the cancelled delayed coker unit at our washington refinery and million for the sulfur handling projects at our washington refinery 
our capital budget is approximately million  including refinery turnarounds and other maintenance costs of approximately million 
the capital budget does not include any capital spending for the pending acquisitions 
the capital budget includes spending of million for the delayed coker modification project at our golden eagle refinery  million for the diesel desulfurizer unit at our alaska refinery and million for the sulfur handling projects at our washington refinery 
if the pending acquisition of the los angeles assets is consummated  we expect to spend approximately million to million between and to increase reliability  throughput levels and the production of clean products at this refinery 
we also plan to spend an additional million to million for various environmental projects at the refinery primarily to lower air emissions between and these cost estimates will be further reviewed and analyzed after the transaction is completed and we acquire additional information through the operation of the assets 
see business strategy and overview and environmental capital expenditures for additional information 
refinery turnaround and other maintenance during  we spent million for refinery turnarounds  primarily at our golden eagle  washington and alaska refineries  and an additional million for other maintenance 
in  we expect to spend approximately million for refinery turnarounds  primarily at our golden eagle and utah refineries  and an additional million for other maintenance 
refining throughput and yields in will be affected by scheduled turnarounds at our golden eagle and utah refineries during the first quarter 
long term commitments unless the context otherwise indicates  the following discussion of our long term commitments does not include any commitments we may incur as a result of the pending acquisitions of the los angeles assets or the usa petroleum retail stations 
contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries  debt service and leases see notes d and n in our consolidated financial statements in item 
we also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects 
the following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of december  in millions contractual obligation thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations crude oil supply obligations other purchase obligations capital expenditure obligations projected pension contributions total contractual obligations 
table of contents includes maturities of principal and interest payments  excluding capital lease obligations 
amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings 
capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest 
operating lease obligations represent our future minimum lease commitments 
operating lease commitments for include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year 
represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks  with remaining terms ranging from to months 
prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate with market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices as of december   ranging from per barrel to per barrel  and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which are not included in the table above 
represents primarily long term commitments to purchase chemical supplies and power at our refineries 
these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements 
we estimated our commitments to purchase power at our golden eagle refinery  which has variable pricing provisions  using estimated future market prices 
this contracts minimum volume purchase requirement expires in july actual purchases of electricity at our golden eagle refinery typically exceed the required minimum volumes 
capital expenditure obligations represent minimum contractual payments for certain capital projects 
although we have no minimum required contribution obligation to our pension plan under applicable laws and regulations  we currently project to voluntarily contribute approximately million in amounts are subject to change based on the performance of the assets in the plan  the discount rate used to determine the obligation  and other actuarial assumptions 
see critical accounting policies for further information related to our pension plan 
we are unable to project benefit contributions beyond environmental and other tesoro is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in use for certain emission sources 
conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  retail stations operating and closed locations and refined products terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amounts of such future expenditures 
for further information on environmental matters and other contingencies  see note n in our consolidated financial statements in item environmental liabilities we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our previously owned properties 
at december   our accruals for environmental expenses totaled million 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline and terminal operations and retail stations 
we believe these accruals are adequate  based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation action 
we have completed an investigation of environmental conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our golden eagle refinery 
this investigation is driven by an order from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board that names us as well as two previous owners of the golden eagle refinery 
we are evaluating certain improvements to the wastewater treatment units as a result of this investigation 
a reserve for this matter is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 

table of contents in october  we received a notice of violation nov from the united stated environmental protection agency epa 
the epa alleges certain modifications made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit at our washington refinery prior to our acquisition of the refinery were made in violation of the clean air act 
we have investigated the allegations and believe the ultimate resolution of the nov will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
a reserve for our response to the nov is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
in september  we reached an agreement with the bay area air quality management district the district to settle novs issued to tesoro from january to september alleging violations of various air quality requirements at the golden eagle refinery 
the settlement agreement was executed on october  and tesoro made a cash payment of  to the district during the fourth quarter of pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  tesoro will undertake a supplemental project valued at approximately  a reserve for the supplemental project is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
other environmental matters in the ordinary course of business  we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable  and some matters may require years for us to resolve 
as a result  we have not established reserves for these matters 
on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we cannot provide assurance that an adverse resolution of one or more of the matters described below during a future reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in future periods 
we are a defendant  along with other manufacturing  supply and marketing defendants  in ten pending cases alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
the defendants are being sued for having manufactured mtbe and having manufactured  supplied and distributed gasoline containing mtbe 
the plaintiffs  all in california  are generally water providers  governmental authorities and private well owners alleging  in part  the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees  but we cannot estimate the amount or the likelihood of the ultimate resolution of these matters at this time  and accordingly have not established a reserve for these cases 
we believe we have defenses to these claims and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits 
soil and groundwater conditions at our golden eagle refinery may require substantial expenditures over time 
in connection with our acquisition of the golden eagle refinery from ultramar  inc in may  ultramar assigned certain of its rights and obligations that ultramar had acquired from tosco corporation in august of tosco assumed responsibility and contractually indemnified us for up to million for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august of  which are identified prior to august  pre acquisition operations 
based on existing information  we currently estimate that the known environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations including soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery will exceed the million indemnity 
we expect to be reimbursed for excess liabilities under certain environmental insurance policies that provide million of coverage in excess of the million indemnity 
because of tosco s indemnification and the environmental insurance policies  we have not established a reserve for these defined environmental liabilities arising out of the pre acquisition operations 
in november  we filed suit in contra costa county superior court against tosco alleging that tosco misrepresented  concealed and failed to disclose certain additional environmental conditions at our golden eagle refinery related to the soil and groundwater conditions referenced above 
the court granted tosco s motion to compel arbitration of our claims for these certain additional environmental conditions 
in the arbitration proceedings we initiated against tosco in december  we are also seeking a determination that tosco is liable for investigation and remediation of these certain additional environmental conditions  the amount of which is currently unknown and therefore a reserve has not been established  and which may not be covered by the million indemnity for the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in response to our arbitration claims  tosco filed counterclaims in the contra costa county superior court action alleging that we are contractually responsible for additional environmental liabilities at our golden eagle refinery  including the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
the arbitration is scheduled to begin during march we intend to vigorously prosecute our claims against tosco and to oppose tosco s claims against us  
table of contents and although we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail  we believe that the resolution of the arbitration will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
environmental capital expenditures epa regulations related to the clean air act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline 
our golden eagle  washington  hawaii  alaska and north dakota refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the low sulfur gasoline standards 
we are currently evaluating alternative projects that will satisfy the requirements to meet the regulations at our utah refinery 
epa regulations related to the clean air act also require reductions in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new on road diesel fuel standards became effective on june  in may  the epa issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non road diesel fuel 
the requirements to reduce non road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases between and we spent million in to meet the revised diesel fuel standards  and we have budgeted an additional million in to complete our diesel desulfurizer unit to manufacture additional ultra low sulfur diesel at our alaska refinery 
our golden eagle  washington and hawaii refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the new diesel fuel standards 
we are currently evaluating alternative projects that will satisfy the future requirements under existing regulations at both our north dakota and utah refineries 
in connection with our acquisition of our north dakota and utah refineries  tesoro assumed the seller s obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co 
bp  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the owner of these refineries  tesoro is required to address issues to reduce air emissions 
we spent million during and we have budgeted an additional million through to comply with this consent decree 
we also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
in connection with the acquisition of our golden eagle refinery  subject to certain conditions  we assumed the seller s obligations pursuant to settlement efforts with the epa concerning the section refinery enforcement initiative under the clean air act  except for any potential monetary penalties  which the seller retains 
in november  the consent decree was entered by the district court for the western district of texas in which we agreed to undertake projects at our golden eagle refinery to reduce air emissions 
to satisfy the requirements of the consent decree  we spent million during and we have budgeted an additional million through in december  we proposed an alternative monitoring plan and a schedule for removing atmospheric blowdown towers at the golden eagle refinery to the bay area air quality management district in response to a nov received from that agency in august we have budgeted million through to remove the atmospheric blowdown towers 
during the fourth quarter of  we received approval by the hearing board for the bay area air quality management district to modify our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker at our golden eagle refinery which is designed to lower emissions while also enhancing the refinery s capabilities in terms of reliability  lengthening turnaround cycles and reducing operating costs 
we negotiated the terms and conditions of the second conditional abatement order with the district in response to the january mechanical failure of the fluid coker boiler at the golden eagle refinery 
the total capital budget for this project is million  which includes budgeted spending of million in and million in the project is currently scheduled to be substantially completed during the first quarter of  with spending through the first half of we have spent million from inception of the project  of which million was spent in we will also spend capital at the golden eagle refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery 
we spent million during and we have budgeted an additional million through to complete the project 
our capital budget also includes spending of million through to upgrade a marine oil terminal at the golden eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the state of california in february the los angeles assets are subject to extensive environmental requirements 
if we consummate the purchase of the los angeles assets  we anticipate spending approximately million to million between and 
table of contents for various environmental projects at the refinery primarily to lower air emissions 
these estimates will be further reviewed and analyzed after the transaction is completed and we acquire additional information through the operation of the assets 
pension funding for all eligible employees  we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on years of service and compensation 
our long term expected return on plan assets is  and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a return of million in and million in based on a discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december   the fair value of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of however  the funded employee pension plan was funded based on its current liability  which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations 
although tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in  we voluntarily contributed million to improve the funded status of the plan 
we currently have no minimum required contribution obligation to our funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in  however  we currently project to contribute approximately million in future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets  employee demographics and other factors 
see note l in our consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion 
claims against third parties in  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
our protest asserted that the taps intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced 
the regulatory commission of alaska rca considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years through the rca set just and reasonable final rates for the years through  and held that we are entitled to receive approximately million in refunds  including interest through the expected conclusion of appeals in december the rca s ruling is currently on appeal to the alaska supreme court  and we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in the appeal 
in  the rca rejected the taps carriers proposed intrastate rate increases for and maintained the permanent rate of to the valdez marine terminal 
that ruling is currently on appeal to the alaska superior court  and the taps carriers did not move to prevent the rate decrease 
the rate decrease has been in effect since june the taps carriers attempted to increase their intrastate rates for   and without providing the supporting information required by the rca s regulations and in a manner inconsistent with the rca s prior decision in order these filings were rejected by the rca 
the rejection of these filings is currently on appeal to the superior court of alaska where the decision is being held in abeyance pending the decision in the appeals of the rates for if the rca s decisions are upheld on appeal  we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our shipments from january through mid june if the rca s decisions are not upheld on appeal  we could potentially have to pay the difference between the taps carriers filed rates from mid june through december  averaging approximately per barrel and the rca s approved rate for this period per barrel plus interest for the approximately million barrels we have transported through taps in intrastate commerce during this period 
we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in these appeals 
we also believe that  should we not prevail on appeal  the amount of additional shipping charges cannot reasonably be estimated since it is not possible to estimate the permanent rate which the rca could set  and the appellate courts approve  for each year 
in addition  depending upon the level of such rates  there is a reasonable possibility that any refunds for the period january through mid june could offset some or all of any additional payments due for the period mid june through december  in january of  tesoro alaska company intervened in a protest before the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  of the taps carriers interstate rates for and if tesoro alaska company prevails and lower rates are set  we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our interstate shipments for and we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this proceeding 
in july  the taps carriers filed a proceeding at the ferc seeking to have the ferc assume jurisdiction under section of the interstate commerce act and set future rates for intrastate transportation on taps 
we have filed a protest in that proceeding  which has now been consolidated with the other ferc proceeding seeking to set just and reasonable interstate rates on taps for and if the taps carriers should prevail  then the rates charged for all shipments of alaska north slope crude oil on taps could be revised by the ferc  but any ferc changes to 
table of contents rates for intrastate transportation of crude oil supplies for our alaska refinery should be prospective only and should not affect prior intrastate rates  refunds or additional payments
