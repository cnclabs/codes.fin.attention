item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   and overview mediacom communications corporation is the nation s eighth largest cable television company based on customers served and among the leading cable operators focused on serving the smaller cities and towns in the united states 
through our interactive broadband network  we provide our customers with a wide array of broadband products and services  including analog and digital video services  such as vod  hdtv and dvrs  hsd and phone service 
we offer triple play bundles of video  hsd and voice to of our estimated homes passed 
bundled products and services offer our customers a single provider contact for ordering  provisioning  billing and customer care 
as of december   our cable systems passed an estimated million homes and served million basic subscribers in states 
we provide digital video services to  digital customers and hsd service to  customers  representing a digital penetration of of our basic subscribers and a data penetration of of our estimated homes passed  respectively 
we introduced telephone service across several of our markets during the second half of and provided service to  customers as of december   representing a penetration of of our estimated marketable phone homes 
we evaluate our growth  in part  by measuring the number of rgus we serve 
as of december   we served million rgus  representing a penetration of of our estimated homes passed 
rgus represent the total of basic subscribers and digital  data and phone customers 
we have faced increasing levels of competition for our video programming services over the past few years  mostly from dbs providers 
since they have been permitted to deliver local television broadcast signals beginning in  directv and echostar  now have essentially ubiquitous coverage in our markets with local television broadcast signals 
their ability to deliver local television broadcast signals has been the primary cause of our loss of basic subscribers in recent years 
hurricane losses in and in july and august  as a result of hurricanes dennis and katrina  our cable systems in areas of alabama  florida  and mississippi experienced  to varying degrees  damage to their cable plant and other property and equipment  service interruption and loss of customers 
we estimate that the hurricanes initially caused losses of approximately  basic subscribers   digital customers and  data customers 
as of december   we have not recovered a significant number of these subscribers 
in september  as a result of hurricane ivan  our cable systems in areas of alabama and florida experienced  to varying degrees  damage to cable plant and other property and equipment  service interruption and loss of customers 
we estimate that the hurricane caused losses of  basic subscribers   digital customers and  data customers 
we are insured against certain hurricane related losses  principally damage to our facilities  subject to varying deductible amounts 
we cannot estimate at this time the amounts that will be ultimately recoverable under our insurance policies 
adjusted oibda we define adjusted oibda as operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results but is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
we believe adjusted oibda is useful for investors 
table of contents because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management  and provides a measure that can be used to analyze  value and compare the companies in the cable television industry  which may have different depreciation and amortization policies  as well as different non cash  share based compensation programs 
a limitation of adjusted oibda  however  is that it excludes depreciation and amortization  which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business 
management utilizes a separate process to budget  measure and evaluate capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted oibda has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the our non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda should not be regarded as an alternative to either operating income or net income loss as an indicator of operating performance nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that operating income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted oibda

average monthly data revenue per data customer is calculated based on monthly data revenue divided by the average number of data customers for each of the twelve months 
revenues rose  largely attributable to growth in our data and phone customers and higher video rates and service fees 
video revenues represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable television products and services including basic  expanded basic and digital cable programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation  reconnection and late payment fees  and other ancillary revenues 
data revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers  including commercial establishments  for our data products and services and equipment rental fees 
phone revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers 
advertising revenues represent the sale of advertising time on various channels 

table of contents video revenues increased  as a result of the impact of basic rate increases applied on our subscribers and higher service fees from our advanced video products and services  offset in part by the loss of basic subscribers 
during the year ended december   we lost  basic subscribers as compared to a loss of  basic subscribers in the prior year 
average monthly video revenue per basic video subscriber increased 
data revenues rose  primarily due to a year over year increase in data customers and  to a lesser extent  the growth of our commercial service and our enterprise network businesses 
largely as a result of the expiration of longer term promotional offers taken in  average monthly data revenue per data customer increased from the prior year period 
phone revenues were million for the year ended december  phone customers grew by  during  as compared to  in as of december   mediacom phone was marketed to million homes  and we expect to market the product to nearly of our estimated homes passed by the end of advertising revenues increased  largely as a result of stronger local advertising sales and political advertising 
political advertising  which was negligible in  contributed approximately of overall advertising revenue growth in costs and expenses significant service costs include programming expenses  employee expenses related to wages and salaries of technical personnel who maintain our cable network  perform customer installation activities  and provide customer support  data costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity and customer provisioning  and field operating costs  including outside contractors  vehicle  utilities and pole rental expenses 
video programming costs  which are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  represent our largest single expense and have historically increased due to both increases in the rates charged for existing programming services and the introduction of new programming services to our customers 
video programming costs are expected to continue to grow principally because of contractual unit rate increases and the increasing demands of television broadcast station owners for retransmission consent fees 
as a consequence  it is expected that our video gross margins will decline as increases in programming costs outpace growth in video revenues 
service costs rose  primarily due to increases in programming and employee expenses and customer growth in our phone and hsd services 
video programming expense increased  principally as a result of higher unit costs charged by our programming vendors  offset in part by a lower number of basic subscribers 
recurring expenses related to our phone and hsd services grew because of the significant increase of our phone and data customers 
employee operating costs rose by due to higher levels of headcount and compensation  and lower capitalized activity by our technicians 
service costs as a percentage of revenues were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
significant selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call centers  customer service and support and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  marketing  bad debt  billing  advertising  and office costs related to telecommunications and office administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses rose  principally due to higher taxes and fees and office  advertising sales and administrative and customer service employee expenses  offset in part by lower sales commissions paid to our employees 
taxes and fees increased by due principally to higher property taxes and franchise fees 
office expenses rose due to higher call center telecommunications charges 
advertising sales expense grew commensurate with the increase in our advertising sales revenue 
employee costs grew by due primarily to higher levels of salary and non cash  share based compensation in our administrative and customer service workforce 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
corporate expenses rose  principally due to increases in employee compensation  mostly non cash  share based compensation  offset in part by a decrease in legal fees 
corporate expenses as a percentage of revenues were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents depreciation and amortization decreased due an overall decrease in capital spending 
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda rose  due to revenue growth  partially offset by higher service costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income operating income grew  largely due to growth in adjusted oibda and  to a lesser extent  a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by  primarily due to higher market interest rates on variable rate debt 
loss gain on derivatives  net we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in variable market interest rates 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of billion 
the changes in their mark to market values are derived from changes in market interest rates  the decrease in their time to maturity and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded a loss on derivatives amounting to million for the year ended december  and a gain of million for the year ended december  loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt totaled million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this includes a premium paid on the redemption of the notes and the write off of deferred financing costs associated with various refinancing transactions occurring in both and see liquidity and capital resources 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december  and  based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances  we determined that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as a result  we increased our valuation allowance and recognized a million corresponding non cash charge to income tax expense for the year ended december  we periodically assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies 
as a result of these assessments in prior periods and the current period  we have established valuation allowances on a portion of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
net loss as a result of the factors described above  primarily the provision for income taxes  the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the loss on derivatives  net  we incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of million  as compared to net loss of million for the year ended december

average monthly date revenue per data subscriber is calculated based on monthly data revenue divided by the average number of data subscribers for each of the twelve months 
revenues rose  largely attributable to an increase in data revenues 
to strengthen our competitiveness  we increased our emphasis on product bundling and on enhancing and differentiating our video products and services with new digital packages  vod  hdtv  dvrs and more local programming 
during  we also extended the discount periods of our promotional campaigns for digital and data services from three and six months to six and twelve months 
this impacted the growth of our video and data revenues 
video revenues increased as a result of the rate increases applied on our subscribers and higher fees from our advanced video products and services  offset in part by the decrease in basic subscribers  including the full year impact of basic subscribers lost in the hurricane  and the effects of promotional activity 
our loss of basic subscribers decreased significantly during  with a loss of  basic subscribers  compared to a loss of  in our loss of basic subscribers in resulted from continuing competitive pressures by other video providers and  to a lesser extent  the impact of hurricanes dennis and katrina 
the average monthly video revenue per basic subscriber increased year over year 
digital customers increased to  from  a year ago 
data revenues rose  primarily due to the year over year increase in data customers  and to a lesser extent  the growth of our commercial service and enterprise network businesses 
average monthly data revenue per data customer decreased as a result of promotional offers during advertising revenues increased and reflected the anticipated decline in political advertising revenues as compared to the election year 
this increase was a result of stronger national and regional advertising and a larger base of homes available to our advertising sales  which came from the interconnection of additional cable systems 
in june  we launched mediacom phone in one of our smaller markets  and as of december   our phone service was marketed to approximately million of our total estimated million homes and served  customers 
costs and expenses service costs rose  primarily due to increases in programming  plant operating and employee costs 
the largest component of service costs is programming expense  which increased as a result of reduced launch support from our programming suppliers in return for our carriage of their services  and higher unit costs charged by them  offset in part by a lower base of basic subscribers 
plant operating costs rose  primarily due to greater use of outside contractors for customer installation activity and  to a lesser extent  higher vehicle fuel costs 
employee costs grew  primarily as a result of increased headcount and overtime of our technical workforce for network phone readiness  customer installation activity and hurricane related repair  offset in part by higher labor and overhead capitalization and reduced employee insurance expenses 
service costs as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to higher employee expenses  marketing costs  and professional fees  offset in part by reduced bad debt expense 
employee costs rose  as a 
table of contents result of increased direct sales personnel  sales commissions and the use of third party call center contractors 
marketing costs grew  due to an increase in costs associated with contracted direct sales personnel and advertising campaigns to support sales of our products and services 
professional fees increased  as a result of higher consulting expenses and other fees 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense  as a result of improved customer credit and collection policies and better collection experience in our advertising business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
corporate expenses rose  primarily due to increases in employee salary and benefit costs  including non cash compensation charges  and higher legal and accounting fees 
corporate expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased  primarily due to the retirement of assets and disposals related to hurricane dennis and katrina 
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda declined due to increases in service costs and selling  general and administrative expenses that outpaced revenue growth 
operating income operating income decreased by largely due to increases in service costs and the decline of adjusted oibda 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by  primarily due to higher market interest rates on variable rate debt 
gain on derivatives  net we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the changes in their mark to market values are principally derived from changes in market interest rates and time to maturity 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded a gain on derivatives amounting to million for the year ended december   as compared to a gain on derivatives of million for the year ended december  gain on sale of assets and investments  net we recorded a net gain on sale of investments of million for the year ended december   due to the sale of our investment in american independence corporation common stock 
the net gain for the year ended december  was principally due to the sale of a non strategic cable system in may  serving approximately  subscribers  for gross proceeds of about million 
other expense other expense was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
other expense primarily represents amortization of deferred financing costs and fees on unused credit commitments 

table of contents provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was approximately million for december   compared to  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we increased our income tax expense by million as a result of our decision to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  principally relating to our pre tax net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards had a balance of approximately billion as of december   and if not utilized  will expire in the years through the state net operating loss carryforwards had a balance of approximately billion as of december   and if not utilized  will expire in the years through we periodically assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets  considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our results of operations  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies 
as a result of these assessments  in prior years we have established valuation allowances on a portion of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
during the fourth quarter of  based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances  we determined that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we increased our valuation allowance by approximately million and recognized a corresponding non cash charge to income tax expense 
this amount represents the portion of deferred tax liabilities related to the basis differences of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
our assessment of the facts and circumstances took into account our losses before income taxes in  the reduced likelihood of future taxable income and the limited availability of prudent tax planning strategies 
net loss income as a result of the factors described above  we generated a net loss for the year ended december  of million  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have invested  and will continue to invest  in our network to enhance its reliability and capacity  and in the further deployment of advanced broadband services 
our capital spending has recently shifted from network upgrade investments to the deployment of advanced services 
we also may continue to make strategic acquisitions of cable systems 
we have a high level of indebtedness and incur significant amounts of interest expense each year 
we believe that we will meet our debt service  capital spending and other requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities  and our ability to secure future external financing 
as of december   our total debt was billion 
of this amount  million matures within the year ending december  during the year ended december   we paid cash interest of million  net of capitalized interest 
we own our cable systems through two principal subsidiaries  mediacom llc and mediacom broadband llc 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc llc group have a billion bank credit facility the llc credit facility expiring in  of which million was outstanding as of december  the llc credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan and a million term loan 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc broadband group have a billion bank credit facility the broadband credit facility expiring in  of which billion was outstanding as of december  the broadband credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan  and an million term loan 
as of december   we had  in total  unused revolving credit commitments of approximately million  of which approximately million could be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes based on the terms and conditions of our debt arrangements 

table of contents for all periods through december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt arrangements 
continued access to our credit facilities is subject to our remaining in compliance with the covenants of these credit facilities  including covenants tied to our operating performance 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in our credit facilities or our other debt arrangements that are based on changes in our credit ratings assigned by any rating agency 
we believe that we will not have any difficulty in the foreseeable future complying with the applicable covenants and that we will meet our current and long term debt service  capital spending  and other cash requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities  and our ability to secure future external financing 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient future financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 
our future access to debt financings and the cost of such financings are affected by our credit ratings 
any future downgrade to our credit ratings could increase the cost of debt and adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds 
the llc credit facility is collateralized by llc group s pledge of all its ownership interests in its operating subsidiaries and is guaranteed by llc group on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests 
the broadband credit facility is collateralized by broadband group s pledge of all its ownership interests in its operating subsidiaries and is guaranteed by broadband group on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests 
our interest rate exchange agreements are scheduled to expire in the amounts of million  million and million during the year ended december   and  respectively 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable period last year 
the change of million is primarily due to the net change in operating assets and liabilities  offset in part by an increase in operating income 
during the year ended december   the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was million  primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable  net of million  and a decrease in other non current liabilities of million  offset in part by an increase in deferred revenue of million 
the change in accounts receivable  net is primarily due to higher revenues and a decrease in the mark to market valuation of our interest rate exchange agreements 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities  which consisted primarily of capital expenditures  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures decreased million  primarily due to lower spending on customer premise equipment 
financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the comparable period in  largely due to net bank and bond financings of million to fund the repayment of million of senior notes and million of class a share repurchases 
our principal financing activities included the following on may   llc group refinanced a million term loan with a new term loan in the amount of million 
borrowings under the new term loan bear interest at a rate that is less than the interest rate of the term loan that it replaced 
the new term loan matures in january  whereas the term loan it replaced had a maturity of february on may   broadband group refinanced a million term loan with a new term loan in the amount of million 
the new term loan consists of two tranches i a million term loan which was funded on may   and ii a million delayed draw term loan the delayed draw term loan 
borrowings under the new term loan bear interest at a rate that is less than the interest rate of 
table of contents the term loan that it replaced 
the new term loan matures in january  whereas the term loan it replaced had a maturity of february on june   borrowings under the delayed draw term loan were used as follows i to repay the company s convertible senior notes due july   plus accrued and unpaid interest  ii to reduce borrowings but not commitments outstanding under the revolving credit portion of our subsidiary credit facilities  and iii for working capital purposes 
on july   we redeemed all of our outstanding notes due with available funds from our subsidiary credit facilities 
on october   we issued million of notes due  and used the proceeds to reduce borrowings but not commitments outstanding under the revolving portion of our subsidiary credit facilities 
pursuant to our board authorized share repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million during the year ended december  other we have entered into interest rate exchange agreements with counterparties  which expire from january through august  to hedge billion of floating rate debt 
these agreements have been accounted for on a mark to market basis as of  and for the year ended december  under the terms of all of our interest rate exchange agreements  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are major banking firms with investment grade ratings  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
as of december   about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
the average interest rate for borrowings under the revolving commitments of our credit facilities is now libor plus as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued to various parties as collateral for our performance relating to insurance and franchise requirements

interest payments on floating rate debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using amounts outstanding as of december  and the average interest rates applicable under such debt obligations 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new cable service installations 
capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
any changes to these estimates  which may be significant  are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed 
indefinite lived intangibles our cable systems operate under non exclusive franchises granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and they were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these cable franchise rights contribute to our revenues 
accordingly  with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
we no longer amortize the cable franchise rights and goodwill 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
based on the guidance outlined in eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the unit of accounting for testing franchise value for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the unit reporting level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have three cable system clusters  or reporting units  for the purpose of applying sfas no 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
to test our goodwill and cable franchise rights for impairment 
we assess the fair values of each cable system cluster using discounted cash flow methodology  under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner 
this involves certain assumptions and estimates  including future cash flow expectations and other future benefits  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if these estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future 
such impairments could potentially be material 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  calculated using the residual method  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 

table of contents the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
we completed our most recent impairment test as of october   which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights and goodwill 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards we assess all available positive and negative evidence including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and available prudent tax planning strategies 
in forecasting future taxable income we use assumptions that require significant judgment and are consistent with the estimates we use to manage our business 
during  we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million and recognized a corresponding non cash charge to the provision for income taxes 
at december   the valuation allowance had a balance of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the need for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
we expect to add to our valuation allowance any increase in deferred tax liabilities relating to indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will also adjust our valuation allowance if we assess that there is sufficient change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periods the estimates are revised 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas statement no
