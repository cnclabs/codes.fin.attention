table of contents flexible printed circuits 
flexible printed circuits  which consist of copper conductive patterns that have been etched or printed while affixed to flexible substrate materials such as polyimide or polyester  are used to provide connections between electronic components and as a substrate to support these electronic devices 
the circuits are manufactured by subjecting the base materials to multiple processes  such as drilling  screening  photo imaging  etching  plating and finishing 
we produce a wide range of flexible printed circuits  including single sided  double sided  multi layer with and without gaps between layers and rigid flex 
single sided flexible printed circuits  which have an etched conductive pattern on one side of the substrate  are normally less costly and more flexible than double sided flexible printed circuits because their construction consists of a single patterned conductor layer 
double sided flexible printed circuits  which have conductive patterns or materials on both sides of the substrate that are interconnected by a drilled or copper plated hole  can provide either more functionality than a single sided flexible printed circuit by containing conductive patterns on both sides  or greater shielding of components against electromagnetic interference than a single sided flexible printed circuit by covering one side of the circuit with a shielding material rather than a circuit pattern 
multi layer and rigid flex printed circuits  which consist of layers of circuitry that are stacked and then laminated  are used where the complexity of the design demands multiple layers of flexible printed circuitry 
if some of the layers of circuitry are rigid printed circuit material  the product is known as a rigid flex printed circuit 
gapped flexible printed circuits  which consist of layers of circuitry that are stacked and separated in some parts of the circuit  and laminated in other parts of the circuit  are used where the complexity of the design demands multiple layers of flexible printed circuitry but the flexibility of a single sided flexible printed circuit in some parts of the circuit 
flexible printed circuit assemblies 
flexible printed circuits can be enhanced by attaching electronic components  such as connectors  switches  resistors  capacitors  light emitting devices  integrated circuits  cameras and optical sensors  to the circuit 
the reliability of flexible printed circuit component assemblies is dependent upon proper assembly design and the use of appropriate fixtures to protect the flex to connector interface 
connector selection is also important in determining the signal integrity of the overall assembly a factor which is very important to devices that rely upon high system speed to function properly 
we are one of the pioneers in attaching connectors and components to flexible printed circuits and have developed the expertise and technology to mount a full range of electronic devices  from ordinary passive components to advanced and sophisticated surface mount components 
customers our customers include leading oems  ems providers and display manufacturers in a variety of sectors of the electronics industry 
these sectors include mobile phones  smart mobile devices  portable bar code scanners  personal digital assistants  computer storage devices and medical devices 
our expertise in flexible printed circuit design and component assembly enables us to assist our customers in resolving their design challenges through our design and assembly techniques  which frequently results in the customer placing our product designs on the customers design specifications and can enhance the likelihood of us becoming the main provider for flexible printed circuits and component assembly included in that product 
achieving status as a main provider to an oem for a high volume program can enable us to build strong customer relationships with respect to existing products and any future product that requires the use of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
we generally work with oems in the design of their products  and the oems subsequently either purchase our products directly or instruct the ems providers and display manufacturers to purchase our products to be 
table of contents incorporated into the oem s product 
ems providers that we sell to include foxconn and flextronics 
our relationships with ems providers and display manufacturers normally are directed by the oems  therefore  it is typically the oems that negotiate product pricing and volumes directly with us  even though the purchase orders come from the ems providers 
for the past several years  motorola and its subcontractors have been our largest customers 
in the fiscal years ended september   and  we sold products to be incorporated into motorola s products to approximately  and motorola subcontractors  which aggregated  and of our net sales including direct sales to motorola amounting to  and  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal year  sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc  or sony ericsson became one of our largest customers 
in the fiscal years ended september   and  we sold products to be incorporated into sony ericsson s products to approximately  and sony ericsson subcontractors  which aggregated  and of our net sales  respectively 
our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our products 
over recent years  we have experienced a strong first fiscal quarter  followed by reduced net sales in the second fiscal quarter  as a result of partial seasonality of our major customers and the markets that we serve 
our major customers provide consumer related products that generally experience their highest sales activity during the calendar year end holiday season  therefore  we typically experience a decline in our second fiscal quarter sales as this holiday period ends 
however  this pattern may not continue 
our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past are likely to do so in the future 
our facilities in the united states and china enable us to manufacture products for shipment anywhere in the world 
for the fiscal year ended september   we derived of our net sales in the united states and of our net sales outside the united states

for the fiscal years ended september   and  we had long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively  in the united states  and million  million and million  respectively  in china 
sales and marketing we sell our products primarily through our in house design and application engineers  who meet regularly with our customers and potential customers to assist in the initial design of the proposed products and to provide suggestions on how our flexible printed circuit solutions can enhance product design 
by utilizing market and product teams in each sector of the electronics industry that we target  we have successfully expanded our market penetration by leveraging our design and application engineers within each of these teams 
in particular  these engineers apply the principal of concurrent engineering to our customers engineers in the early phases of the product development cycle 
we engage the services of non exclusive sales representatives to interact with customers and potential customers on our behalf 
fourteen of these sales representatives are located throughout the united states  with one also covering china 
we also have one sales representative in each of canada  korea  japan and taiwan 
we rely on these sales representatives to initiate contact with potential customers and provide leads to our internal sales and marketing teams  as well as to create  build and maintain our customer relationships and assist in the resolution of contractual disputes 

table of contents as of september   our backlog  which constitutes customer orders placed with us that we believe to be firm but that have not yet shipped  was million 
we expect to ship this entire backlog during fiscal year we cannot guarantee that our customers will not cancel any or all of the orders in our backlog 
our current backlog also is not indicative of our future operating results 
as of september   our backlog was million 
as of september   our backlog was million 
technology we are a global provider of single  double sided  multi layer and gapped flexible printed circuit technology and component assemblies 
our process technology includes proprietary processes and chemical recipes  which coupled with our design expertise  unique customized fixtures and tooling and manufacturing experience  enables us to deliver high unit volumes of complex flexible printed circuits and component assemblies at cost effective yields 
design technology 
the flexible printed circuits we manufacture are designed specifically for each application  frequently requiring significant joint design activities with the customer at the start of a project 
we have developed design methodologies that solve difficult interconnection problems and save our customers time and money 
we design and mass produce flexible printed circuits that range from single sided circuits to more complex double sided  multi layer with and without gaps between layers and rigid flex 
we continually are investing in and improving our computer based design tools to more quickly design new flexible printed circuits  enhance cooperative design and communication with our customers and more closely integrate design and application engineering to our prototyping and manufacturing process 
circuit fabrication technology 
we have extensive experience producing fine line flexible printed circuits and have developed manufacturing processes that are designed to deliver high unit volumes at cost effective yields 
in the flexible printed circuit industry  fine line flexible printed circuits are easier to construct as the thickness of the copper decreases  however  as the thickness of the copper decreases  the cost of fabrication increases 
we have developed a manufacturing process to pattern plate in selective regions of the circuitry pattern  such as around the holes used to connect the two sides of a double sided flexible printed circuit 
in addition  the normal manufacturing technology  by itself  has been improved with new equipment which enables thicker  less expensive copper to be etched down precisely enough to form fine line circuitry 
the combination of these two processes allows us to achieve finer patterns without a substantial increase in costs and with generally acceptable yields 
in addition to fine line techniques  we have developed a proprietary process using ultraviolet lasers to drill inch diameter holes  known as micro vias  for the connection of circuits on the reverse side of the substrate 
the combination of the fine lines and micro vias are part of the new high density interconnect technology that is one of our competitive strengths 
component assembly and test technology 
our component assembly and test technology involve the arrangement of the circuits on a panel to minimize material waste and facilitate requirements for component assembly  such as placing tooling holes  optical locators for vision based machines  test points and pre cut zones to allow part removal without compromising the integrity of the components 
we assemble passive electrical and various mechanical components  including capacitors  resistors  integrated circuits  connectors  stiffeners  diodes and other devices to flexible printed circuits 
we also perform advanced assembly of integrated circuit devices  as well as the functional testing of these flexible printed circuit component assemblies 
assembling these components directly onto the flexible printed circuit increases performance and reduces space  weight and cost 
in addition  through our subsidiary aurora optical  we have developed advanced optical  packaging  software and material designs to manufacture ultra thin camera modules and highly integrated flex assemblies using optical modules 
we have also developed our own software for optical testing  which will allows us to better integrate the key components necessary to our customers with the flex  thus providing them with a high value added service 

table of contents intellectual property our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our intellectual property relates to proprietary processes and know how covering methods of designing and manufacturing flexible printed circuits  attaching components  optical and photonic designs  process technology for circuit manufacturing  and embedded magnetics for chargers 
we regularly require our employees to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment of invention agreements to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  we consider filing patents on our inventions that are significant to our business  although none of our existing patents or patent applications pertain to inventions that are significant to our current business 
we also pursue trademarks where applicable and appropriate 
in the future  we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
we believe that our design and manufacturing processes do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party  however  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute 
suppliers we purchase raw circuit materials  process chemicals and various components from a limited number of outside sources  including ei dupont de nemours co  rogers corporation  molex inc  supertex  inc and itt  inc for components  we normally make short term purchasing commitments to key suppliers for specific customer programs 
these commitments are usually made for three to month periods 
these suppliers agree to cooperate with us in engineering activities  as required  and in some cases maintain a local inventory to provide shorter lead times and reduced inventory levels for us 
in most cases  suppliers are approved and often dictated by our customers 
for process chemicals  certain copper and polyimide laminate materials and certain specialty chemicals used in our manufacturing process  we rely on a limited number of key suppliers 
alternate chemical products are available from other sources  but process chemical changes often require approval by our customers and requalification of the processes  which could take weeks or months to complete 
we seek to mitigate these risks by identifying stable companies with leading technology and delivery capabilities and by attempting to qualify at least two suppliers for all critical raw materials and components 
competition the flexible printed circuit market is competitive  with a variety of large and small companies offering design and manufacturing services 
the flexible printed circuit market is differentiated by customers  applications and geography  with each niche requiring specific combinations of complex packaging and interconnection 
we believe that our ability to offer an integrated  end to end flexible printed circuit solution has enabled us to compete favorably with respect to design capabilities  product performance  reliability and consistency  price  customer support and application support  and resources  equipment and expertise in component assembly on flexible printed circuits 
we compete on a global level with a number of leading asian providers  such as flextronics  foxconn electronics  inc  global flex holidays ltd  sumitomo bakelite  and fujikura ltd  and with domestic providers 
we expect others to enter the market in the asian region because of government subsidies and lower labor rates available there 
we believe that our technology leadership and capabilities in designing and manufacturing flexible printed circuits and component assemblies have enabled us to build strong partnerships and customer relationships with many companies 
we believe that customers typically rely upon a limited number of vendors designs for the life of specific applications and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of similar applications 
accordingly  it is difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer for any application once a different vendor has been selected to design and manufacture a specific flexible printed circuit 
this market paradigm may provide a barrier to our competitors in the markets in which we compete  however  it may also present an obstacle to our entry into other markets 
any expansion of existing products or services could expose us to new competition 

table of contents employees as of november   we employed approximately  full time employees and  contract employees  including full time employees and contract employees in the united states  and  full time employees and  contract employees in china 
we have never had a work stoppage 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
we have entered into employment agreements with substantially all of our employees in china 
in general  these employment agreements provide for either a one or two year term 
in addition  we believe that a small number of our employees in china have formed a trade union committee which has proposed that we enter into a collective bargaining agreement 
at this time  we are not a party to  nor do we intend to enter into  a collective bargaining agreement with these or any of our other employees at any of our facilities in china 
we are not aware that the committee represents any employee other than the employees who actually are members of the committee 
we presently do not believe that we will experience any material harm to our business if we do not enter into a collective bargaining agreement 
environmental controls flexible printed circuit manufacturing requires the use of chemicals 
as a result  we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture our products in the united states and china 
as of september  and  we reserved  and  of restricted cash  at the direction of the county of orange  california  to finance estimated environmental clean up costs in the event that we vacate our anaheim facilities  otherwise  our review of our facilities suggests that no material remediation costs will be required 
however  given the uncertainties associated with environmental contamination  there can be no assurance that such costs will not harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we believe we have been operating our facilities in substantial compliance in all material respects with existing environmental laws and regulations 
however  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied 
for this reason  we implemented procedures designed to minimize the negative impacts and reduce potential financial risks arising from environmental issues 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies could require substantial expenditures by us and could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not anticipate any material amount of environmental related capital expenditures in fiscal year available information we file reports with the securities and exchange commission sec 
we make available on our website under investor relations  free of charge  our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the sec

risk factors factors that may affect our operating results our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  any of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
risks related to our business we depend on a limited number of customers for significant portions of our net sales and if we lose business with any of these customers  our net sales could decline 
for the past several years  a substantial portion of our net sales has been derived from products that have been incorporated into products that are manufactured by or on behalf of motorola  inc for the years ended september   and   and  respectively  of our net sales were to motorola and approximately  and of its subcontractors  respectively 
several subcontractors of motorola also have  from time to time  constituted significant customers of ours 
in addition  we also rely on sales from a limited number of other emerging customers 
for example  for the three months ended september   of our net sales were to sony ericsson or its subcontractors and of our net sales were to research in motion or its subcontractors 
although generally we assist our customers in the design of their products and the customer directs its subcontractors to purchase products from us  one or more subcontractors could look to another source for the components to be incorporated into the products they supply to the customer 
in addition  if the customer were to reduce its orders to any of its subcontractors or if the customer were to choose another flexible printed circuit assembly manufacturer to supply any portion of its products  it could reduce the orders that these customers place with us  which could substantially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  our net sales in fiscal year were impacted by a significant decline in net sales to motorola  which sales decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
we must obtain orders from new and existing customers on an ongoing basis to increase our net sales and grow our business 
we are continuing our efforts to reduce dependence on a limited number of customers  however  net sales attributable to a limited number of customers and their subcontractors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any one of these customers  a significant reduction in sales we make to them  a reduction in the pricing of our products sold to them or any problem collecting accounts receivable from them would reduce our net income 
in addition  even if we are able to increase sales to other customers  we still expect to have a small number of customers to whom we make significant sales 
we are heavily dependent upon the wireless industry  and in particular  the handset market  and any downturn in this industry may reduce our net sales 
for the years ended september   and   and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from sales to companies that provide products or services to the wireless industry 
in general  the wireless industry is subject to economic cycles and has experienced in the past  and is likely to experience in the future  periods of slowdown 
intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand characterize the industry as a whole 
the wireless industry also generally is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
fluctuations in demand for our products as a result of periods of slowdown in the wireless market or discontinuation of products or modifications developed in connection with next generation products could reduce our net sales 

table of contents our customers have and may continue to cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or qualify additional vendors  any of which could reduce our net sales 
substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and we are not always able to predict with certainty the timing or magnitude of these orders 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to receive any orders from our customers  and our net sales will be harmed if we are unable to obtain a sufficient number of orders from  or ship a sufficient number of products to  customers in each quarter 
in addition  our customers may cancel  change or delay product purchase orders with little or no advance notice to us 
business practices of certain customers may change from sales on a purchase order basis to sales on a master purchase contract basis  which may affect the way we do business with those customers 
also  we believe customers may be increasing the number of vendors upon which they rely for manufacturing 
qualification of additional vendors for an application for which we are also qualified may result in our net sales being lower than our forecast of sales 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we are not able always to forecast with certainty the net sales that we will make in a given period and sometimes we may increase our production capacity  working capital and overhead in expectation of orders that may never be placed  or  if placed  may be delayed  reduced or canceled 
the following factors  among others  affect our ability to forecast accurately our net sales and production capacity changes in the specific products or quantities our customers order  variability in our manufacturing yields  long lead times and advance financial commitments for our plant and equipment expenditures  long lead times and advance financial commitments for components required to complete anticipated customer orders  and price reductions due to competitive pressure 
delayed  reduced or canceled orders also may result in our inability to recover costs that we incur in anticipation of those orders  such as costs associated with purchased raw materials or components  because we are often required  and in the past year  we have experienced a trend where we are more often being required  to purchase materials and components before a customer becomes contractually committed to an order in order to be able to timely deliver such order to the customer 
in addition  delayed  reduced or canceled orders may result in write offs of obsolete inventory and the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity if we decline other potential orders because we expect to use our capacity to produce orders that are later delayed  reduced or canceled 
for example  in fiscal  we incurred a net million in write downs as a result of the bankruptcy of one of our customers  which had a material impact on our earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year although a certain portion of this amount was recovered in the second and third quarters of fiscal 
we will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design our flexible printed circuit products into their product offerings  if our customers product offerings are not commercially successful  or if we do not timely execute our operational and strategic plans 
we sell our flexible printed circuit products directly or indirectly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that include our products and component assemblies in their product offerings 
as a result  we rely on oems to select our products to be designed into their product offerings 
we must qualify our products with our customers  which involves demonstrating to our customers that our products can be manufactured within specified tolerances 
this process can be time consuming  complex  costly and difficult 
if an oem selects one of our competitors to provide a product instead of us  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that oem because changing component providers after the initial production runs begin involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the oem 
our customers typically are not obligated to purchase products from us and can stop using our products at any time 
even if an oem designs one of our products into its product offering  we have no assurance that the product will be commercially successful  that we will receive any order from that manufacturer or that we will not be undercut by a competitor s pricing 
we cannot be certain that our current products will continue to be selected for design into our customers products or that our customers will not also qualify additional vendors for their products 
in addition  our long term strategy relies in part on new technologies and products 
we cannot be certain that our new technology and 
table of contents products will be selected by customers  especially if we are unable to obtain certain industry approval  including underwriters laboratory approval for the charger products we are working to develop 
if we are unable to obtain additional customer qualifications  if we cannot qualify our products for high volume production quantities  if we do not execute our operational and strategic plans for new products in a timely manner or if our customers increase their reliance on additional sources for their production  our net sales may decrease 
wbl corporation beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock and is able to exert influence over us and our major corporate decisions 
wbl corporation beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of wbl corporation s ownership interest and its influence over the composition of our board of directors  wbl corporation has influence over our management  operations and potential significant corporate actions 
for example  so long as wbl corporation continues to control more than a majority of our outstanding common stock  it will have the ability to control who is elected to our board of directors each year 
in addition  for so long as wbl corporation effectively owns at least one third of our voting stock  it has the ability  through a stockholders agreement with us  to approve the appointment of any new chief executive officer or the issuance of securities that would reduce wbl corporation s effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as defined in this stockholders agreement  wbl corporation is deemed to effectively own approximately of our current outstanding stock 
given that wbl corporation has the ability to block any proposed issuance of shares that would reduce its effective ownership to less than a majority of our common stock  measured on an effective ownership basis  wbl corporation could preclude us from engaging in an acquisition or other strategic opportunity that we may want to pursue if such acquisition or opportunity required the issuance of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may also discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company  which could deprive our other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our company  could harm the market price of our common stock and could impede the growth of our company 
to the extent that wbl corporation beneficially owns a significant portion of our outstanding common stock  even if less than a majority  it will continue to have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders 
wbl corporation is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party  including a participant in our industry  or from buying additional shares of our stock 
wbl corporation and its designees on our board of directors may have interests that conflict with our interests 
we believe that wbl corporation and its designees on our board of directors may have interests that conflict with  or are different from  the interests of our other stockholders  including  for example  as a result of wbl corporation s substantial ownership of mfs 
these conflicts of interest could include potential competitive business activities  corporate opportunities  indemnity arrangements  registration rights  sales or distributions by wbl corporation of our common stock and the exercise by wbl corporation of its ability to influence our management and affairs 
if any conflict of interest is not resolved in a manner favorable to our stockholders  our stockholders interests may be substantially harmed 
in general  wbl corporation does not have the ability to prevent us from making operational decisions that do not require stockholder approval  however  wbl corporation does have the ability to control who is elected to our board of directors each year and therefore can influence decisions that require board approval 
in addition  pursuant to our stockholders agreement with wbl corporation  for so long as wbl corporation effectively owns at least one third of our voting stock  it has the ability to approve the appointment of any new chief executive officer or the issuance of securities that would reduce wbl corporation s effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
in general  our certificate of incorporation does not contain any provision and we do not have any other established procedure that is designed to facilitate resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interest or to ensure that potential business opportunities that may become available to both wbl corporation and us will be reserved for or made available to us 

table of contents wbl corporation is currently unable to vote its shares on specified matters that require stockholder approval without obtaining its own stockholders and regulatory approval and it is possible that wbl corporation s stockholders or the relevant regulators may not approve the proposed corporate action 
wbl corporation s ordinary shares are listed on the singapore securities exchange trading limited  or the singapore exchange 
under the rules of the singapore exchange  to the extent that we constitute a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation  as defined by the rules of the singapore exchange  at any time that we submit a matter for the approval of our stockholders  wbl corporation may be required to obtain the approval of its own stockholders for such action before it can vote its shares with respect to our proposal or dispose of our shares of common stock 
for the fiscal year ended september   we were a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation as defined by the rules of the singapore exchange  which state that we are deemed a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation for any given fiscal year that our audited consolidated pre tax profits consolidated into wbl corporation accounts for more than of the consolidated pre tax profits of wbl corporation during our immediately prior fiscal year 
we expect to continue to be a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation for the foreseeable future 
examples of corporate action we may seek to take for which we would need to obtain our stockholder approval include an amendment of our certificate of incorporation  a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  a merger or reorganization transaction  and an issuance of shares of our common stock in an offering other than a public offering at a price of less than fair market value if the number of shares being sold exceeds of our then outstanding common stock 
to obtain stockholder approval  wbl corporation must prepare a circular describing the proposal  obtain approval from the singapore exchange and send the circular to its stockholders  which may take several weeks or longer 
in addition  wbl corporation is required under its corporate rules to give its stockholders advance notice of the meeting 
consequently  if we need to obtain the approval of wbl corporation at a time in which we qualify as a principal subsidiary including this year  the process of seeking wbl corporation s stockholder approval may delay our proposed action and it is possible that wbl corporation s stockholders may not approve our proposed corporate action 
it is also possible that we might not be able to establish a quorum at our stockholder meeting if wbl corporation was unable to vote at the meeting as a result of the singapore exchange rules 
the rules of the singapore exchange that govern wbl corporation are subject to revision from time to time  and policy considerations may affect rule interpretation and application 
it is possible that any change to or interpretation of existing or future rules may be more restrictive and adverse to us than the existing rules and interpretations 
if we are unable to attract or retain personnel necessary to operate our business  our ability to develop and market our products successfully could be harmed 
we are heavily dependent on our current executive officers and management 
we believe that our success is highly dependent on the contributions of philip a 
harding  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  and reza meshgin  our president and chief operating officer 
we do not have employment contracts with these or any other key personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 

table of contents in addition  due to the expansion of companies into the flex market and increased competition in the flex market  we anticipate that our employees may be heavily recruited by our competitors 
furthermore  we believe an increase in the number of manufacturers in suzhou  china and the surrounding areas has increased the competition for qualified employees and we are experiencing a significant employee turn over rate in our facilities in china 
the costs of retaining such employees  in china  and the location of certain of our facilities in the united states may make it difficult to recruit qualified employees at those facilities 
the loss of any key employee or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers  sales and marketing personnel  management or finance personnel could delay the development and introduction of our products  harm our reputation or otherwise damage our business 
rapidly changing standards and competing technologies could make our products obsolete  which would cause our net sales to decrease 
the development and evolution of markets for our flexible printed circuit products depends on industry standards 
our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  such as operating temperature range 
competing standards may emerge that are preferred by our customers 
we will need to make capital expenditures to support technological advances and to develop and manufacture new products and product features that our customers demand 
in addition  any new product we introduce may have competing technologies available from which we may have to choose 
if we choose technology or a standard that does not become the industry standard  we may be unable to sell those products or we may be unable to obtain a supplier for the raw materials for such products 
we also expect future flexible printed circuits and component assembly solutions to require higher performance specifications  including  for example  higher density circuitry than we have historically produced  and to incorporate new materials and components which may impact manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
we may incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change  and we may need to replace  modify or design  build and install equipment  all of which would require additional capital expenditures 
if our customers were to switch to alternative technologies or adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible or fail to adopt standards with which our products are compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our net sales may decrease 
problems with manufacturing yields could result in higher operating costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
if we cannot achieve expected yields in the manufacture of our products  we may incur higher per unit costs  lower profits and reduced product availability and may be subject to substantial penalties by our customers 
low yields may result from  among other things  design errors  manufacturing failures in new or existing products  the inexperience of new employees  or the learning curve experienced during the initial and ramp up stages of a new product introduction 
any reduction in our ability to timely deliver products to customers could adversely affect our customer relationships and make it more difficult to sustain and grow our business 
in addition  reduced yields can significantly harm our gross margins thereby contributing to lower profitability or even losses 
further  we have not yet manufactured camera modules in high volume production  and we may encounter difficulties in doing so 
any such difficulties could harm our ability to sustain or grow our business 
we may not be able to compete effectively  which will cause our net sales and market share to decline 
on a global level  we compete primarily with large flexible printed circuit board manufacturers located throughout asia  including taiwan  china  korea  japan and singapore 
we believe the number of customers in the market is consolidating and the number of suppliers continues to increase 
the competitive landscape in our market is changing rapidly and we may lose our market share if we do not implement operational improvements in response to the evolving marketplace 
if we do not compete successfully  our net sales and market share may decline 
we believe that one of our principal competitive advantages is our ability to interact closely with our customers throughout the design and engineering process 
if we are not successful in maintaining or establishing close relationships with customers in markets in which we compete  we may not be able to grow our market share or net sales 
to the extent that we are not able to provide regular interaction between our engineers and our 
table of contents customers and potential customers  our business may be harmed 
in some cases  our competitors may offer more favorable pricing to potential or existing customers 
in addition  we believe more companies are now producing flexible printed circuit boards than before 
such competition could increase pressure on us to lower our prices  which  in turn  would harm our margins and operating results 
in addition  many of our customers are larger  established electronic manufacturing services  or ems  providers 
certain of these ems providers have developed or acquired their own flexible printed circuit manufacturing capabilities or have extensive experience in electronics assembly  and in the future  may cease ordering products from us and may compete with us on future oem programs 
furthermore  many companies in our target customer base are moving the design and manufacturing of their products to original design manufacturers  or odms  in asia 
if we are unable to capture  maintain and continue to service these odms as customers  we may be unable to sustain or grow our business 
in addition  we sell both flex and flex assemblies to our customers  which include both ems providers and oems 
even if the ems providers aren t able to capture a significant portion of the flex business from us  they or the oems could still stop ordering the flex assembly from us  or significantly reduced their assembly orders to us 
if this occurs  our net sales could be significantly reduced and our net income would also be impacted 
our products and their terms of sale are subject to various pressures from our customers and our competitors  any of which could harm our gross profit 
we deal with a limited number of large customers who are able to exert significant pressure on us  both in terms of pricing and contract terms 
we enter into price reduction negotiations with these customers on a periodic basis  typically annually  semi annually or quarterly 
we also renegotiate the terms of our contracts  which specify  among other items  quality requirements  liability and indemnification thresholds and payment terms  with many of our customers on an annual or semi annual basis 
due to increased competition  customers have recently exerted significant pricing pressure on us  which has contributed to a decline in our profitability 
we may lose our market share if we do not participate in such negotiations  furthermore  changes in contract terms  including price reduction activities  may result in lower margins for us and the extension of payment terms for our customers  which could negatively affect our cash flow 
our selling prices are also affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy  pricing of competitors products and our products life cycles 
in addition  from time to time we may elect to reduce the price of certain programs we produce in order to gain additional orders on those programs 
a typical life cycle for one of our products begins with higher prices when the product is introduced and decreasing prices as it matures 
to offset price decreases during a product s life cycle  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yield and productivity to reduce a product s cost 
if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during a product s life cycle  or if we are required to pay liquidated damages to a customer due to a breach of contract claim  including due to quality or delivery issues  our cost of sales may increase  which would harm our profitability 
significant product failures could harm our reputation and our business 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  quality control  material costs and successful product testing capabilities are critical to our growth 
return rates on our products may fluctuate  and we have recently experienced an increase in our return rate 
our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement stringent testing and manufacturing processes for our products may not be sufficient 
if any flaw in the design  production  assembly or testing of our flexible printed circuit products was to occur  we may experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in significant delays in product shipments  cancellation of orders  substantial penalties from our customers and their customers  substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation 
any failure to maintain ongoing sales through our independent sales representatives could harm our business 
to date  we have sold our products through our direct sales force and a network of non exclusive independent sales representatives 
we rely on these sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market 
table of contents our products directly to our global customer base 
our sales representatives are not obligated to continue selling our products  and they may terminate their arrangements with us at any time with limited notice 
it is possible that we may not be able to maintain or expand these relationships successfully or secure agreements with additional sales representatives on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any failure to develop and maintain our relationships with these sales representatives and any failure of our sales representatives to effectively market our products could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to be able to procure raw materials and components on commercially reasonable terms to manufacture our products profitably 
at times  there are worldwide shortages of the components and raw materials used in the fabrication of flexible printed circuits and imaging solutions 
our customers require that we use components that have been pre qualified by them  which further limits the supply of components available to us and frequently results in our need to seek components from a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers of certain of our components may consider us too small of a customer to sell to directly  which could require us to buy through distributors  which could increase the cost of such components 
we generally do not maintain a large surplus stock of raw materials or components for our products because the specific assemblies are uniquely applicable to the products we produce for our customers  therefore  we rely on short term supply contracts with third party suppliers to provide these raw materials and components in a timely fashion and on commercially reasonable terms 
our operations would be negatively impacted if we are unable to receive raw materials or components on a timely or cost effective basis 
in addition  our operations and gross margins may be negatively impacted if materials or components do not meet our or our customers specifications  even if our customer had specified from whom we must purchase such materials or components 
given the rapid increase in demand for flexible printed circuits and imaging solutions  a worldwide shortage for these materials may exist from time to time 
in the past  a similar shortage for flexible printed circuit materials required that we qualify an additional supplier in order to maintain the delivery of our largest production run  and during certain quarters of fiscal  we experienced component shortages which resulted in delayed shipments to customers 
we expect that these delays could occur in future periods  and we may not be successful in managing any shortage of raw materials or components that we may experience  which would decrease our net sales 
during the year ended september   and we purchased greater than of all materials used to make flexible printed circuits from three sources  ei dupont de nemours co  mitsui plastic  inc and rogers corporation 
in the fiscal years  and  we purchased approximately  and of these materials from dupont   and from mitsui  and approximately  and from rogers  respectively 
for many of our large customers  we now purchase components directly from the oem 
where we do not purchase components directly from the oem  molex inc and itt  inc 
are currently our largest component suppliers 
in the fiscal year  we purchased and of our components from molex and itt 
in the fiscal year  we purchased and of our components from molex and itt 
in the fiscal year  we purchased and of our components from molex and itt 
we face business  political  regulatory  operational  financial and economic risks because a significant portion of our operations and sales are to customers outside of the united states 
our primary manufacturing facilities are located in china 
although our headquarters are located in california and we also have operations in arizona  we expect that our operations in china will continue to assume a larger and more important role in our business 
we are subject to risks inherent in international business  many of which are beyond our control  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws  including employment laws  
table of contents difficulties in collecting payments from foreign customers to whom we have extended significant amounts of credit if those customers do not pay us on the payment terms extended to them  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including cultural differences in the conduct of business  labor and other workforce requirements and inadequate local infrastructure  the need to successfully migrate our foreign locations to the financial reporting system used by us in the united states  including the need to implement and maintain financial controls that comply with the sarbanes oxley act  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels  longer payment cycles for  and greater difficulty collecting  accounts receivable  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that render our prices uncompetitive or increase our cost of doing business  specifically the chinese rmb  which has consistently appreciated against the us dollar since the fourth quarter of our fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the people s bank of china increased the rate at which the rmb us dollar exchange can fluctuate  which resulted in greater rmb appreciation during the third and fourth quarters 
we expect the rmb appreciation against the us dollar to continue to increase in the future  which will result in the increase in the cost of our business in china due to the movement in the exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  royalties and withholding taxes that restrict the repatriation of earnings and affect our effective income tax rate due to profits generated or lost in foreign countries  political and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  increases in the cost of doing business in china  including increases due to changes in environmental regulations  increased competition for employees and new or increased governmental fees or assessments  requests from the government that we relocate facilities which we had planned to continue to operate for the foreseeable future  and actions from agencies controlled by the government possibly designed to compel or encourage such relocation  unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements  including without limitation  safety  labor  health or occupational welfare regulations  which could require us to change the manner in which we do business or increase the costs of our doing business 
for example  in october  the minimum wage in suzhou  china was increased from a monthly wage of rmb to rmb with only two weeks notice to employers  disruptions or shortages in the supply of electricity or other utilities  the occurrence of natural disasters or other acts of force majeure which may disrupt or otherwise impede communications between our facilities and may cause our facilities not to have access to the systems or information required to operate the business  and public health emergencies such as sars and avian flu 
any of these factors could harm our international sales and operations significantly 
our manufacturing capacity may be interrupted  limited or delayed if we cannot maintain sufficient sources of electricity in china  or if there is a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in china 
the flexible printed circuit fabrication process requires a stable source of electricity 
as our production capabilities increase in china and our business grows  our requirements for a stable source of electricity in china will grow substantially 
we have experienced a lack of sufficient electricity supply and expect that we may continue to experience insufficient power supplies in the foreseeable future 
although we have purchased several 
table of contents generators  we cannot be assured that such generators will produce sufficient electricity supply in the event of a disruption in power 
power interruptions  electricity shortages  the cost of diesel fuel to run our back up generators or government intervention  particularly in the form of rationing  are factors that could restrict our access to electricity in suzhou  china  the location of our chinese manufacturing facilities  and affect our manufacturing costs 
any such shortages could result in delays in our shipments to our customers and  potentially  the loss of customer orders and penalties from such customers for the delay 
our two primary manufacturing facilities are both located in suzhou  china 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including wildfires and other fires  earthquakes  excessive rain  terrorist attacks and wars  could disrupt our manufacturing or operational abilities  which could harm our operations and financial results 
china s legal and regulatory systems embody uncertainties that could harm our business operations 
since  many new laws and regulations covering general economic matters have been promulgated in china 
despite the development of the legal system  china s system of laws is not yet complete 
even where adequate law exists in china  enforcement of contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic  and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction 
the relative inexperience of china s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation  and interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes 
in addition  changes in the regulations or policies or the application of existing regulations or policies in china generally  or specifically in suzhou where our factories are located  may affect our ability to conduct or expand our business 
for example  in the chinese government announced that the printed circuit board  or pcb  business was no longer considered to be a high tech industry  and as such  it was no longer an encouraged industry to migrate to  or expand in  china 
in addition  we have recently been informed that effective december   the production of single sided flexible printed circuit boards will no longer be considered a high tech industry 
although these classifications have not affected our operations to date  if the government were to determine that multi layer flexible printed circuit boards are no longer within the high tech industry classification  it could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand operations in china 
as another example  we have recently been informed that one of our facilities in china may no longer meet the current fire department regulations 
if interpretations or changes in the application of the fire code resulted in our need to take immediate corrective action  it could also adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our operations in suzhou 
our activities in china will be subject to administrative review and approval by various national and local agencies of china s government 
given the changes occurring in china s legal and regulatory structure  we may not be able to secure the requisite governmental approval for our activities 
failure to obtain the requisite governmental approval for any of our activities could impede our ability to operate our business or increase our expenses 
we may have difficulty managing any growth that we might experience 
if we continue to experience growth in our operations  our manufacturing facilities  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls may need to be expanded  which will distract our management team from our business plan and involve increased expenses 
our success will depend substantially on the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively 
these challenges may include the ability to timely and in a cost effective manner hire and retain employees  particularly in our suzhou  china locations  the ability of our management to predict accurately increases or decreases in demand for our products and manage our manufacturing capacity appropriately  maintaining our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the net sales we generate  managing multiple  concurrent manufacturing expansion projects  the ability to ramp up and manage multiple new programs concurrently  higher over time and scrap rates often associated with periods of growth  
table of contents implementing and improving our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including our computer systems  managing operations in multiple locations and multiple time zones  the ability to timely and in a cost effective manner increase our manufacturing capacity and build new manufacturing facilities in order to meet customer demands  the failure of either of which could cause customers to take their business to our competitors  and the ability to acquire customers in a new line of business 
if we do not effectively manage any growth we might experience  and deliver on any increase in orders we might receive from any customer  in addition to losing a growth opportunity  we may lose the customer and its orders all together  which could adversely affect our net sales and income 
the sarbanes oxley act and other rules and regulations may increase the time and costs of certain activities 
we incur significant legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company 
the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have increased our financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly 
we believe that these rules and regulations have also affected the cost of our director and officer liability insurance  and  from time to time  we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
we continue to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
our business is capital intensive and the failure to obtain capital could require that we curtail capital expenditures 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment  facilities and technological improvements 
we expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
we may need to raise additional funds through further debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  under the terms of our stockholders agreement with wbl corporation  wbl corporation s approval is required for the issuance of securities that would reduce its effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock 
if wbl corporation s approval is required  it is possible that wbl corporation may not approve any transaction we may seek to complete  which could affect whether we are able to complete such a transaction 
if we cannot raise the required capital when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose net sales and market share 
the following factors could affect our ability to obtain additional capital on favorable terms  or at all our results of operations  general economic conditions and conditions in the electronics industry  the perception of our business in the capital markets  our ratio of debt to equity  our financial condition  our business prospects  wbl corporation s approval  if required  the international aspects of our business  including the foreign location of a majority of our physical assets and the fact that a majority of our customers are located overseas  and 
table of contents interest rates 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may have to curtail our capital expenditures 
any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net sales  reduced quality of our products  increased manufacturing costs for our products  harm to our reputation  reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business 
we are subject to the risk of increased income and other taxes in china 
we currently enjoy tax holidays and other tax incentives for our operations in china 
the tax holiday rate of for our first manufacturing facility in china  mfc  will expire on december  after this time  mfc will be subject to an income tax rate of  based on current law 
we have obtained two tax holidays for our second manufacturing facility in china  mfc the first tax holiday allows for tax free operation for the first two years beginning in the first year of profitability followed by three years of operation at a reduced rate of income tax equal to on the profits generated from the original registered capital 
the second tax holiday allows for tax free operation for the first two years followed by three years of operation at a reduced rate of income tax equal to on the profits generated from the increased capital 
beginning on february   mfc became subject to a tax holiday rate of on approximately of its profits and a tax holiday rate of on approximately of its profits 
however  these tax holidays may be challenged  modified or even eliminated by taxing authorities or changes in law 
for the fiscal years ended september  and we realized tax savings of million and million respectively  for our operations in china 
the national people s congress  china s top legislative body  passed the unified china corporate income tax law on march  the new corporate income tax rate will decrease from to effective january  unused tax holidays for existing foreign invested enterprises will be grandfathered until they expire 
mfc s tax holiday will expire on december  mfc s first and second tax holidays will expire on december  and  respectively 
we have analyzed the tax impact of this law change and concluded that there is no material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  from time to time we may be subject to various types of tax audits by the tax authorities 
for example  an audit relating to the import and export of raw and component materials at mfc during fiscal year resulted in our need to incur a charge of approximately million to cost of sales for value added tax and duty  plus interest and penalties 
our bank facilities contain restrictive covenants that  if not satisfied or waived  could impact our ability to borrow money under these facilities and could result in acceleration of our debt obligations under these facilities that may be outstanding from time to time 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants in our bank facilities could result in an event of default which  if not satisfied or waived  could preclude us from borrowing money under one or more of these facilities or may result in us being required to repay any borrowings we may have under our facilities from time to time 
in addition  our facility with norddeutsche landesbank girozentrale  or nlg  provides that nlg can refuse to honor a draw request from us for any reason  even if we are in full compliance with the terms of the facility 
if we were unable to borrow under these facilities to finance our operations or we were unable to refinance borrowings under our facilities that may come due  our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
if we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our net sales or increase our costs 
we primarily rely on trade secrets relating to our manufacturing processes to protect our proprietary rights 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be effective and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies 
we compete in industries 
table of contents with rapid development and technological innovation 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors could offer similar products using processes or technologies developed by us and thereby potentially harm our competitive position and our financial condition 
we also rely on patent protection for the intellectual property that we have developed 
it is possible that a third party may challenge the validity of any of these patents  or circumvent the patents by developing competing products based on technology that does not infringe our patents 
consequently  our patents may not provide meaningful protections against competition for these products 
further  in some countries outside the united states  patent protection is not available 
moreover  some countries that do allow registration of patents do not provide meaningful redress for patent violations 
as a result  protecting intellectual property in those countries is difficult and competitors may sell products in those countries that have functions and features that infringe on our intellectual property 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
from time to time  we have received  and expect to continue to receive  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
some of these claims may lead to litigation 
any intellectual property lawsuit  whether or not determined in our favor or settled  could be costly  could harm our reputation and could divert our management from normal business operations 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of our proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
in addition  we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology  and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to develop a non infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
complying with environmental laws and regulations may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used in the manufacture of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in china  where we are subject to constantly evolving environmental regulation 
the costs of complying with any change in such regulations and the costs of remedying potential violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by governmental entities in china could be substantial 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data for materials used in our manufacturing processes 
we reserved  and  of restricted cash for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  at the direction of the county of orange  california  to finance estimated environmental clean up costs in the event that we vacate our anaheim facilities 
in the event of a violation  we may be required to halt one or more segments of our operations until such violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of remedying violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by governmental authorities could be substantial 
any remediation of environmental contamination would involve substantial expense that could harm our results of operations 
in addition  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations may be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations may be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations could be significant 

table of contents we may not address successfully problems encountered in connection with any acquisition 
we expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities  complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies 
potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including problems assimilating the purchased technologies  products or business operations  including the timely integration of financial reporting systems 
problems maintaining uniform standards  procedures  controls and policies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  start up costs associated with any new line of business we may acquire  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering new markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  potential litigation risks associated with acquisitions  whether completed or not  the need to hire additional employees to operate effectively the acquired business  including employees with specialized knowledge  and increased legal and accounting costs as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions and strategic investments properly  our management team may be distracted from our day to day operations  our business may be disrupted and our operating results may suffer 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders would be diluted 
we also may be limited in our ability to finance an acquisition through the issuance of convertible debt or equity as a result of our stockholders agreement with wbl corporation  which requires wbl corporation s approval before we issue securities which would dilute its effective ownership as defined in the agreements below of our outstanding common stock 
litigation may distract us from operating our business 
litigation that may be brought by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenditures and distract our management from the operations and conduct of our business 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we would prevail in such litigation or resolve such litigation on terms favorable to us  which may adversely affect our operations 
in connection with the terminated conditional offer for the outstanding shares of mfs technology ltd  we may be sued by wbl corporation  mfs  or others  including stockholders of us and or mfs 
there is no guarantee that any such suits will be covered by our insurance or that such suits might not result in substantial fines  penalties or adverse judgments against us 
in addition  the singapore securities industry council  or the sic  may review whether the actions of our board of directors and special committee of our board of directors are  from the singapore regulatory perspective  reasonable and appropriate in light of the developments and circumstances 
any such review  if it commences  likely will involve a significant distraction to management 
further  if the sic determines that our board of directors or special committee have not acted appropriately  it may impose sanctions or fines or censures on us  which may further distract our management and harm our business 

table of contents risks related to the market for our common stock our stock price may be volatile  and you may not be able to resell our shares at a profit or at all 
the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate  and has fluctuated  due to the factors discussed in this report and elsewhere in our sec filings 
for example  during the months ended september   our stock traded between and per share 
in addition  the trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the public float that exists in our stock from time to time 
for example  although we have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  approximately million of those shares are held by a few investors 
if any of those investors were to decide to sell a substantial portion of their respective shares  it would place substantial downward pressure on our stock price 
the trading market for our common stock also may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our industry 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us were to publish an unfavorable research report or to downgrade our stock  our stock price likely would decline 
if one or more of these analysts were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
in addition  the stock market in general  and nasdaq and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
our historical trading prices and valuations may not be sustainable 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
in the event we are unable to remedy any deficiency we identify in our system of internal controls over financial reporting  or if our internal controls are not effective  our business and our stock price could suffer 
in preparation for the annual report of management regarding our evaluation of our internal controls that is required to be included in each of our fiscal year end annual reports by section of the sarbanes oxley act  or section  we adopted a project work plan to assess the adequacy of our internal controls  remediate any deficiency that we may identify  validate that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal controls 
as part of this continuous process  we may discover deficiencies that require us to improve our procedures  processes and systems in order to ensure that our internal controls are adequate and effective and that we are in compliance with the requirements of section if any deficiency we may find from time to time is not adequately addressed  or if we are unable to complete all of our testing and any remediation in time for compliance with the requirements of section and the sec rules thereunder  we would be unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective  which could adversely affect investor confidence in our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we do not complete our testing with sufficient time for an independent registered public accounting firm to complete their audit of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be compliant with all of the requirements under section since we may not receive an unqualified report on internal control over financial reporting  and our business and stock price may be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our products  our ability to sell our products at specific prices  our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes and costs and the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity 
historically  we have experienced a strong first fiscal quarter  followed by reduced net sales in the second fiscal quarter  as a result of partial seasonality of our major customers and the markets that we serve 
as a result  our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
you should not rely on period to period 
table of contents comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our net sales and results of operations may be below our expectations or the expectations of analysts and investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our expense levels in the future will be based  in large part  on our expectations regarding net sales 
many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales 
we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
future sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
as of september   we had million shares of common stock outstanding and million shares subject to unexercised options that are fully vested 
all of these shares are eligible for resale  subject to certain volume limitations 
to the extent any major stockholder sells its shares into the market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include the following the existence of a classified board of directors requiring that not all directors be elected at one time  a majority of our directors are required to be independent  the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the size of our board of directors without stockholder approval  the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors created by the death  resignation or incapacity of a director or the enlargement of the board of directors without stockholder approval  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting  the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  the ability of the board of directors to issue and designate the rights of  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock  which rights could be senior to those of common stock  the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent  and so long as a single or related group of stockholders own at least one third of our outstanding common stock  a transaction between us and any person or entity in which such stockholder or stockholders have a material interest  if required under applicable federal and state law and or nasdaq rules to be approved by our stockholders  will require approval of a majority of the outstanding shares not held by such interested stockholders present in person or by proxy at the meeting of stockholders held with respect to such transaction 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  or delaware law 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions

overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we offer customized flexible printed circuit applications and services ranging from design and application engineering  prototyping and high volume manufacturing to turnkey component assembly and testing 
we target our solutions within the electronics market and  in particular  we focus on applications where flexible printed circuits facilitate human interaction with an electronic device and are the enabling technology in achieving a desired size  shape  weight or functionality of the device 
current applications for our products include mobile phones and smart mobile devices  portable bar code scanners  personal digital assistants  power supplies and consumable medical sensors 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed a wholly owned chinese subsidiary  mfc  to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our products 
mfc provides a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and multi layer flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
in fiscal  we formed a second wholly owned subsidiary in china  mfc  to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity 
in fiscal  we acquired the assets of applied optics  inc  a company which designed and manufactured optical and photonic imaging solutions  and now operate this business as aurora optical  inc  a subsidiary of m flex 
net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
we engage the services of non exclusive sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
thirteen of these sales representatives are located throughout the united states  with one also covering japan 
we also have one sales representative in each of canada  korea and taiwan 
the variety of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are to customers outside of the united states 
sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes and delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our anaheim  california and tucson  arizona facilities are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or chinese renminbi for sales made in china 
during fiscal year  our net sales were impacted by a shift in our customer base 
although net sales to our largest customer decreased from of net sales in fiscal year to of net sales in fiscal year  our net sales to all other customers grew in total by million  or nearly  in fiscal year as compared to this growth was driven primarily by a increase in net sales during fiscal year to our second largest customer  as well as growth in net sales to two other customers 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales consists of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs include all materials and facilities associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost represents the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product and includes stock based compensation expense related to such personnel 
purchased process services relate to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements 
during fiscal year  we experienced reduced gross margins  primarily due to lower yields associated with the ramp up and high volume production of numerous new parts across an expanded base of customers  price reductions established in early fiscal and overhead increases 
research and development research and development costs are incurred in the development of new products and processes  including significant improvements and refinements to existing products and are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related costs associated with our sales and marketing  business development and engineering support groups and expenses for overseas sales support  trade show and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and benefits of administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel and other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment and other corporate office expenses 
interest income interest income consists of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents balances and short term investments 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense incurred on our lines of credit 
other income expense  net other income and expense  net  consists primarily of our gain or loss on foreign currency exchange 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents the american jobs creation act of  or the job creation act  was signed into law on october  the job creation act contains provisions that replace an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
we completed our evaluation of this deduction and concluded there is no material impact on our current year tax liability 
however  we continue to evaluate the financial impact on future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues  which we refer to as net sales  are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that states a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectibility of the related account receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
we report revenues net of an allowance for returns  refunds and credits  which we estimate based on historical experience 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand  therefore  our estimates of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may increase or decrease  which we will record in the period such determination was made 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of any valuation allowance  we have considered taxable income in prior carryback years  future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
in addition  we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible amounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  we might not continue to 
table of contents experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the majority of our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers  therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves 
we provide a two to thirty six month warranty on our products 
we provide a warranty reserve for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the net sales are recognized 
while we engage in quality programs and processes  up to and including the final product  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of the failed product and the inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing defective parts 
we continuously monitor and analyze product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of replacement vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during july of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
to date  we have had no impairments of goodwill 
stock based compensation 
in first quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas r 
in accordance with sfas r  in our first quarter of fiscal year  we started to recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  adjusted for an estimated future forfeiture rate  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we utilize the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering on june  our ipo and the minimum value method for stock options granted prior to our ipo 
generally  our calculation of the fair value for options granted under sfas r is similar to the calculation of fair value under sfas with the exception of the treatment of forfeitures 
expected forfeitures of stock options are estimated based on the historical turnover of our employees 
prior to sfas r  we recognized forfeitures under sfas as they occurred 
the fair value of restricted stock units granted is based on the grant date price of our common stock 

table of contents the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including a the expected volatility of our common stock price  which we determine based on historical volatility of our common stock since the date of our ipo  b expected dividends  which are nil  as we do not currently anticipate issuing dividends  c expected life of the stock option  which is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise behavior of our employees  and d risk free interest rate is based on observed interest rates zero coupon us treasury debt securities appropriate for the expected holding period 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense terminated acquisition expenses operating loss income interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net income year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
the essentially flat net sales of million in fiscal versus million in fiscal were primarily attributable to significant offsetting fluctuations in net sales to customers within our wireless sector  which comprised of net sales in fiscal versus during fiscal while net sales to our largest customer decreased million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year due to price reductions and substantially reduced sales volume as a result of increased competition and softer demand from this customer  net sales to our second largest customer increased million  or  during the current fiscal year due to the continuation of high volume orders on programs which were initiated at the end of fiscal as well as the ramping of several new programs during the current fiscal year 
sales to our largest customer  which represented of our net sales in fiscal  decreased to of our net sales in the current fiscal year due to the declines mentioned above as well as the success of our customer diversification efforts  which resulted in our second largest customer increasing from a concentration of of our net sales in fiscal to in fiscal we believe that this expanded wireless customer base will provide an increased opportunity for top line revenue growth in fiscal net sales to the industrial sector  our second largest sector  decreased or million to million for the year ended september  versus million in the prior fiscal year million due to the continued decline in demand 

table of contents cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was driven by several factors 
the main driver was manufacturing yield decreases  which comprised approximately of the increase 
manufacturing yields were negatively impacted by the substantially larger number of new high volume program ramp ups that occurred during fiscal versus fiscal yield improvements were achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the stabilization of these new programs and we expect that further yield improvements will provide additional benefit in fiscal increased overhead spending driven by a increase in sales volumes drove approximately of the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in overhead spending was primarily driven by the million mfc capacity expansion that was on going throughout the second half of fiscal and resulted in some de leveraging of fixed overhead expenses during the current fiscal year in anticipation of higher sales volumes in the latter portion of fiscal and throughout fiscal these sales volume increases were beginning to be realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to customer price reductions which were initiated early in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in the year ended september  versus million in the prior year  a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the price reductions on our products and decreased manufacturing yields  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a result of the sales volume increases and manufacturing yield improvements we began to experience at the end of fiscal  we expect quarterly gross margins to return to the to range in the first half of fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
the increase is primarily due to our increasing focus on new technologies  primarily lens applications and low profile camera modules  as well as increased research and development activities at our anaheim location 
we expect these expenses to grow as we continue to focus on additional new technologies  primarily those which will provide for additional miniaturization and cost reduction of our products  and also allow us to further differentiate ourselves from our competition 
sales and marketing expense 
sales representatives commissions and other sales related expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in commission expense related to the higher commission rates on new programs as well as a  increase in customer support expenses related to the expansion of our international sales offices  particularly our netherlands sales office 
compensation and benefit expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  compensation and benefit expense for fiscal increased to from in fiscal  primarily due to the increased engineering headcount in china to support the number of new program ramp ups during fiscal general and administrative expense 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the million increase in litigation expenses related to the terminated offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of mfs technology ltd 
the mfs offer which were expensed as incurred during the year ended september  head count increases in china related to the planned expansion of the manufacturing capacity of mfc in china also generated approximately  in additional administrative expense during fiscal we expect general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  to remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year 
terminated acquisition costs 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded a million non recurring charge to write off deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the mfs offer 
no charges were recorded during the prior fiscal year 

table of contents interest income 
interest income remained constant at million for fiscal and interest expense 
interest expense increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is attributable to a higher average balance of million carried on our lines of credit during the fiscal versus an average balance of million carried in the prior fiscal year 
other income expense  net 
net other income expense changed to income of  for the year ended september  from expense of  for the prior year 
the change is primarily due to a  increase in gain on foreign exchange

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in cost of sales was driven by a change in product mix at lower margins 
the change in product mix was partially due to the ramp up of new programs as well as a shift in sales of product to our largest customer from higher to lower margin products

in absolute dollars  gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the year ended september  decreased to versus for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to price reductions on our products 
in addition  during the second half of the fiscal year a slow down in sales  due to a loss of market share with our largest customer  resulted in a decrease in gross profit  as we had a lower revenue base over which to leverage our fixed costs 
an overall change in product mix from higher to lower margin products also negatively impacted our gross profit percentage 
as a result  our gross margins shifted substantially lower to a range of approximately to 
this lower range was being driven by pricing pressures resulting from increased competition  and the trend toward higher component content  which are primarily pass through costs with minimal opportunity for mark up

at september   no amounts were outstanding under our loan agreements with shanghai pudong 
table of contents development bank  bank of china or nlg 
the amounts outstanding under these loan agreements at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition based on our current borrowing level 
we derive a substantial portion of our sales outside of the united states 
approximately million  or  of total shipments to these foreign manufacturers for fiscal were made in us dollars 
the balance of our net sales are denominated in chinese renminbi  or rmb 
the exchange rate for the rmb to the us dollar has been an average of rmb per us dollar for the fiscal year ended september  transactions in rmb represent approximately of total net sales from foreign customers for the fiscal year ended september  in july  the people s bank of china  or pboc  terminated the fixed exchange rate between the rmb and the us dollar  adjusted the exchange rate from to and established a maximum daily appreciation against the us dollar 
however  during the third quarter of fiscal  the pboc increased the rate at which the rmb us dollar exchange can fluctuate  which resulted in a greater rmb appreciation 
we expect the rmb appreciation against the us dollar to continue to increase in the future  which will result in an increase in the cost of our business expenses in china due to the movement of the exchange rates 
we generally do not consider it necessary to hedge against currency risk  as a significant portion of our material cost of sales is denominated in us dollars  eliminating much of the need to hedge  however  we continue to be vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar
