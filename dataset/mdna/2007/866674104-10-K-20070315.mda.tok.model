item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit which owns  operates  develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern united states 
as of december   the company owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in eighteen states  including manufactured housing communities  four recreational vehicle communities  and eight properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites 
during  the company acquired a manufactured home community located in oakland county  michigan with occupancy of approximately percent for a total purchase price of million 
the transaction included the assumption of million of debt 
in recent years the operations of manufactured homebuilders  dealers  and the companies that finance the purchase of the homes have experienced severe losses and substantial volatility 
new home shipments have declined from approximately  in to approximately  in  marking a year low for the industry 
the decline was largely due to the turmoil in the financing side of the industry as lenders experienced substantial losses arising from defaults on poorly underwritten loans in the mid to late s and beyond 
as a result of the losses  the lenders experienced liquidity constraints and significantly tightened underwriting standards thus reducing the demand for new homes 
these trends may be abating as the volume of repossessed homes in the market place appears to be declining 
newly repossessed homes are also declining as the reinforcing effects of tightened underwriting standards and reduced new home financing volumes impact the industry 
the effect of these trends on the company has been to reduce occupancies in our portfolio as the demand of tenants for sites in our communities has declined for the above stated reasons 
the rate of leasing in our new community developments has likewise slowed 
despite these trends  the company s same property portfolio has consistently reflected growth in net operating income evidencing the revenue and operating stability long associated with the business of owning and operating manufactured housing communities 
while the problems which directly impacted the manufacturers  dealers  and lenders appear to be bottoming  the company does not expect a rapid or strong recovery in its operations 
the company expects a gradually improving leasing environment in its portfolio 
as a result of these industry conditions  a large quantity of homes repossessed by lenders have become available for purchase at discounts of up to and more from original cost or loan amount 
the company has made every effort to acquire these value priced homes especially as the alternative would likely be the removal of the homes from the community 
such removal would create total dependence on the sale of a new home to fill the site 
as new home shipments have declined by over two thirds from their peak in to current levels  such dependence would leave the company vulnerable to a recovery in new home shipments as its primary method to improve occupancy 
the company intends to sell these value priced homes to residents over time 
in the meantime it is most economical to lease the homes to residents 
at december   the company had  homes rented in its communities which comprise over  sites 
all renters are subject to underwriting criteria 
the company expects to continue to acquire homes from lenders as long as the pricing of the homes remains compelling 
the company is actively developing programs for its renters and others to acquire these homes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets and investment in affiliates 
rental property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
the company measures the recoverability of its assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement evaluation  the impairment that would be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis 
assets are tested for impairment every three years or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in anticipated market price  an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long lived asset 
the company has a percent investment in an affiliate that is reported under the equity method of accounting 
management performs an analysis to determine if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
numerous factors are evaluated in accordance with published gaap and sec staff guidance 
changes in the facts and circumstances evaluated  future adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the affiliate may affect management s analysis 
notes and accounts receivable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements 
the ability to collect notes receivable is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the note s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the note is collateral dependent 
receivables related to community rents are reserved when the company believes that collection is less than probable 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are years for land improvements and buildings  to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment  and years for intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants generally range from month to month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the company and the resident or  in some cases  as provided by state statute 
revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction 
capitalized costs 
the company capitalizes certain costs including interest and other costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of its properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for the company s rental program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period based on the anticipated term of occupancy of a resident 
costs associated with implementing the company s computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
the company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
income taxes 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in order for the company to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of the company s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to its stockholders  which it fully intends to do 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
the company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income 
the company has certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of non reit assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

noi is derived from revenues determined in accordance with gaap minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes determined in accordance with gaap 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
the company believes that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measurement to net operating income 
net income includes interest and depreciation and amortization which often have no effect on the market value of a property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure 
in addition  such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset 
the company believes that net operating income is helpful to investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
the company uses noi as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and or groups of properties 
the principal limitation of noi is that it excludes depreciation  amortization and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  all of which are significant costs  and therefore  noi is a measure of the operating performance of the properties of the company rather than of the company overall 
occupied sites include manufactured housing and permanent recreational vehicle sites  and exclude seasonal recreational vehicle sites 
occupancy and weighted average rent relates to manufactured housing sites  excluding both permanent and seasonal recreational vehicle sites

revenues increased due to an increase in the weighted average monthly rental rate and an increase in the number of leased rental homes 
expenses were also impacted by the increase in the number of leased rental homes 
a comparison of the year ended to the year ended results in similar increases in net operating income  revenue and expenses for the same reasons as noted in the comparison of the year ended to the year ended liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to the company s stockholders and the unitholders of the operating partnership  capital improvements of properties  the purchase of new and pre owned homes  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  and debt repayment

the company plans to invest approximately to million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the development of new communities during the company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit 
the company has invested million in the acquisition of properties during the company continuously seeks acquisition opportunities that meet the company s criteria for acquisition 
should such investment opportunities arise in  the company will finance the acquisitions though the temporary use of its line of credit until permanent secured financing can be arranged  through the assumption of existing debt on the properties or the issuance of certain equity securities

the occupancy of this community is approximately percent 
the company has also invested approximately million in the acquisition of homes primarily intended for its rental program during expenditures for will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales as well as rental homes 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the company s net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in the company s markets  b lower occupancy rates of the properties  c increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to the company s tenants  and d decreased sales or rentals of manufactured homes

the company anticipates meeting its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions  and operating partnership unit redemptions through the collateralization of a significant portion of its properties 
from time to time  the company may also issue shares of its capital stock or preferred stock  issue equity units in the operating partnership or sell selected assets 
the ability of the company to finance its long term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional and local economic conditions

other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of the company s operating performance 
management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs  providing perspective not readily apparent from net income 
management believes that the use of ffo has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income including depreciation and amortization  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income and not as an alternative to net income 
the principal limitation of ffo is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and  accordingly  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo and calculates ffo data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended december    in thousands sun communities  inc

net loss  ffo and ffo per diluted share op unit for the year ended december   adjusted to exclude this impairment  is million  million and per diluted share op unit  respectively 
the company entered into three interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap agreement 
the valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical noncash profit and loss were those hedging transactions terminated at the balance sheet date 
as the company has no expectation of terminating the transactions prior to maturity  the net of these noncash valuation adjustments will be zero at the various maturities 
as any imperfection related to hedging correlation in these swaps is reflected currently in cash as interest  the valuation adjustments reflect volatility that would distort the comparative measurement of ffo and on a net basis approximate zero 
accordingly  the valuation adjustments are excluded from ffo 
the valuation adjustment is included in interest expense 
the company acquired the equity interest of another investor in sunchamp in december consideration consisted of a long term note payable at net book value 
although the adjustment for the allocation of the sunchamp losses based on sunchamp as a stand alone entity is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements  management believes that it is appropriate to provide for this adjustment because the company s payment obligations with respect to the note are subordinate in all respects to the return of the members equity including the gross book value of the acquired equity plus a preferred return 
as a result  the losses that are allocated to the company from sunchamp as a stand alone entity under generally accepted accounting principles are effectively reallocated to the note for purposes of calculating ffo 
a situation such as this is not contemplated in the nareit definition of ffo due to the unique circumstances of the transaction 
although not comparable to the precise nareit definition  the company believes the inclusion of this item in its calculation of ffo to be appropriate as noted above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
the company s primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows 
the company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the company has entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement 
one of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july  another of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july and the third swap agreement  which is only effective for so long as day libor is percent or less  fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july the interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million and a termination date of may  each of the company s derivative contracts is based upon day libor 
the company s remaining variable rate debt totals million as of december   which bears interest at prime  various libor or fannie mae discounted mortgage backed securities dmbs rates 
if prime  libor  or dmbs increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding under the company s variable rate debt facilities for the year ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  the company had a million libor based variable rate mortgage receivable as of december  and if libor increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million based on the million and million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivable for the year ended december  and  respectively
