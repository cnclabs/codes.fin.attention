financial condition liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dispositions  dividends  adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position  with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows twelve months ended december  cash flows from continuing operations in thousands net cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities during increased million over the prior period primarily reflecting higher earnings and margins from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments 
cash used in investing activities during decreased million compared to  reflecting essentially flat acquisition spending  higher proceeds from the disposition of businesses in the period  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures  primarily in the oil gas and micro acoustics businesses 
acquisition expenditures in were  million compared to  million in while proceeds from the disposition of businesses increased million over to million 
capital expenditures of million  which increased million over the prior year  primarily funded investments in plant expansions  plant machinery and information systems 
the company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and  if necessary  through the issuance of commercial paper  established lines of credit or public debt markets 
capital expenditures for are expected to be consistent with levels 
cash provided by financing activities during decreased million when compared to acquisitions during were primarily funded through cash from operations and proceeds generated from dispositions 
in addition  the company repurchased million of treasury shares and paid dividends of million 
adjusted working capital a non gaap measure  calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable increased from december  by million  primarily as a result of acquisitions  foreign exchange translation and the company s organic growth 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency  working capital would have increased by million from december  average annual adjusted 
table of contents working capital as a percentage of revenue a non gaap measure  calculated as the five quarter average balance of accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue decreased to from at year end and inventory turns improved to turns from turns in the prior year 
in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating  investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flow  the company also measures free cash flow a non gaap measure 
management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase dover s common stock 
for further information  see non gaap disclosures at the end of this item free cash flow for the year ended december  was million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in the prior year 
the increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings and margins from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  and lower tax payments  partially offset by higher capital expenditures 
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities 
twelve months ended december  free cash flow in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow free cash flow as a percentage of revenue at december   the company s net property  plant  and equipment totaled million compared to million at the end of the increase in net property  plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of million  capital expenditures of million  partially offset by decreases related to foreign currency fluctuation of million  and depreciation 
the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of million at year end this resulted primarily from decreases in current tax liabilities  increases in deferred tax assets from accruals  a decrease in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
see below and net operating loss carryforwards primarily acquisition related  partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets 
dover s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits increased by million in the increase was due principally to net obligations of million related to acquisitions 
offsetting this increase was a plan asset increase of million due to gains on plan investments during the year and company contributions of million  which were partially offset by benefit payouts 
during  plan amendments  primarily from union negotiated contracts  created an increase in the benefit obligation of million 
due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses  it is estimated that pension expense will increase from million to approximately million in effective december  dover adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statements no

table of contents the company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation a non gaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures at december  at december  net debt to total capitalization ratio in thousands current maturities of long term debt commercial paper and other short term debt long term debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt add stockholders equity total capitalization net debt to total capitalization net debt at december  remained relatively flat as increased cash flow from operations and cash generated from dispositions were used to fund dover s acquisition program

dover s long term debt instruments had a book value of  million on december  and a fair value of approximately  million 
on december   the company s long term debt instruments had a book value of  million and a fair value of approximately  million 
the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk based interest rates for the foreseeable future 
acquisition spending could potentially increase company debt 
however  management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels 
operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company s various cash flow requirements  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company s liquidity  and the company is in compliance with all of its long term debt covenants 
it is anticipated that in any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or  depending upon market conditions  through the issuance of long term debt or some combination of the two

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the company  including information regarding contingencies  risk and its financial condition 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where the financial information of dover is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred 
in revenue transactions where installation is required  revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers 
if the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete 
in addition  when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement  the company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified 
in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
due to the fact that dover operates in many different markets  changes in economic conditions in specific markets generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances required 
inventory for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries and the technologies segment  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
occasionally  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

table of contents dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines including sfas no 
for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
dover s assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist 
the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations 
the valuation of dover s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in dover s pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for dover s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on dover s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
dover s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
dover s discount rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities  as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and the company s future taxable income levels 
dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  dover s experience  and relevant industry data 
dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and company experience 
dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dover s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
the company uses the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of ssars and stock options that are granted to employees 
the model requires management to estimate the expected life of the ssar or option and the volatility of dover s stock using historical data

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt  interest rate swaps attached thereto  commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates of the company s weighted average long term debt interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt 
commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates  and have maturities of three months or less 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates of the company s weighted average commercial paper interest rate on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
the company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates of the company s weighted average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax income 
as of december   the company had two interest rate swaps outstanding  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not enter into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign exchange the company conducts business in various foreign countries  primarily in canada  mexico  substantially all of the european countries  brazil  argentina  malaysia  china and other asian countries 
therefore  changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations 
the company may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into fair value hedges 
certain individual operating companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and or cash flow hedging 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change of or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
