organic net sales growth for the hd supply segment was in fiscal in february  we announced our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives for hd supply 
in order to maximize the value of hd supply  we would need to further integrate it with our retail business 
we are currently evaluating whether this integration or other strategic alternatives  such as a sale or initial public offering of the business  would create the most shareholder value 
we generated billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal we used this cash flow  along with the net proceeds of additional borrowings of billion  to fund billion of share repurchases and dividends  billion in acquisitions and billion in capital expenditures

results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 
we operate in two reportable business segments retail and hd supply 
the retail segment is principally engaged in the operation of retail stores located in the united states  canada  mexico and our recently acquired stores in china 
the hd supply segment distributes products and sells installation services to business to business customers  including home builders  professional contractors  municipalities and maintenance professionals 
we identify segments based on how management makes operating decisions  assesses performance and allocates resources 
the first quarter of fiscal was the first period in which we began to report our results of operations in two segments 
this change was a result of the purchase of hughes supply  which significantly increased the size of hd supply and resulted in changes in our internal reporting and management structure 
the retail segment includes the home depot stores  expo design center stores expo and other retail formats 
the retail segment also includes our retail services business and our catalog and on line sales businesses 
the hd supply segment consists of four major platforms infrastructure  including waterworks and utilities  construction  including construction supply  lumber and building materials  electrical  plumbing hvac and interiors  maintenance  including facilities maintenance and industrial pvf  and repair and remodel 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales total net sales for fiscal increased  or billion  to billion from billion for fiscal of the billion increase  billion  net of intercompany sales  came from our hd supply segment and billion came from our retail segment 
net sales for our retail segment were billion for fiscal  a increase over fiscal fiscal retail segment net sales growth was primarily driven by sales from new stores 
retail comparable store sales decreased for fiscal compared to an increase of for fiscal the decline in retail comparable store sales was driven by a decline in comparable store customer transactions offset in part by a increase in average ticket 
our average ticket increased to for fiscal and increased in of selling departments 
the decrease in retail comparable store sales for fiscal was due to the significant slowdown in the us retail home improvement market as well as difficult year over year comparisons due to sales arising from hurricane activity in fiscal both canada and mexico  however  experienced positive retail comparable store sales for fiscal additionally  our retail comparable store sales results reflect in part the impact of cannibalization 
in order to meet our customer service objectives  we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels  gain incremental sales and increase market penetration 
our new stores cannibalized approximately of our existing stores during fiscal  which had a negative impact to retail comparable store sales of approximately 
despite the difficult us retail home improvement market  we continued to expand our retail services revenue  which increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal the growth in retail services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops  exterior patios  solar  windows and hvac 
our retail services programs focus primarily on providing products and services to our do it for me customers 
our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging baby boomers as they rely more heavily on installation services 
net sales for our hd supply segment for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal the increase was primarily a result of recent acquisitions 
organic net sales growth for the hd supply segment was in fiscal  which includes the impact of commodity price inflation and market share gains 
we believe that our sales performance has been  and could continue to be  negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets 
due to the highly fragmented us home improvement and professional supply industry  in which we estimate our market share is approximately  measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult 
gross profit total gross profit increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased basis points to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decline in total gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily due to a higher penetration of the lower margin hd supply segment 
in fiscal  basis points of the total gross profit decline was a result of a higher penetration of hd supply businesses as well as a drop in hd supply s gross profit rate due to a change in the mix of businesses owned 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a was for fiscal and fiscal the increase in sg a during fiscal was due to added associate labor hours on the floor of our stores  increased spending on store maintenance programs and the expansion of merchandise display resets 
this increase was partially offset by reduced self insurance costs as we continue to realize benefits from safety programs and other initiatives 
fiscal sg a also reflects benefits from our private label credit card  which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit  like bank cards 
through our private label credit card we offer no interest no payment programs 
the cost of deferred interest associated with these programs is included in cost of sales 
we believe these programs deliver long term benefits  including higher average ticket and customer loyalty 
for fiscal  the penetration of our private label credit sales was compared to for fiscal also impacting our sg a in fiscal is expense associated with executive severance of million and the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  whereby we recorded approximately million of stock compensation expense related to the continued vesting of options granted prior to fiscal partially offsetting the increase in sg a was million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations associated with the closing of expo stores in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of our recent acquisitions and the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology

provision for income taxes our combined federal  state and foreign effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to the impact of a retroactive tax assessment from the canadian province of quebec 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the quebec national assembly passed legislation that retroactively changed certain tax laws that subjected us to additional tax and interest 
as a result  we received an assessment from quebec for million in retroactive tax and million in related interest for the through taxable years 
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were for fiscal and for fiscal diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in both fiscal and fiscal by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our billion repurchase authorization 
since the inception of the program in  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total of billion  including billion through accelerated share repurchases in fiscal as of january   we had billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase program 
fiscal compared to fiscal year ended january  fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion for fiscal fiscal net sales growth was driven by an increase in retail comparable store sales of  sales from new stores opened during fiscal and fiscal and sales from our newly acquired businesses within hd supply 
the increase in retail comparable store sales in fiscal reflects a number of factors 
our average ticket  which increased to  increased in all selling departments and our retail comparable store sales growth in fiscal was positive in of selling departments 
building materials had the strongest retail comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum  roofing  concrete and insulation  due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern us history 
we experienced strong retail comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations 
we also experienced strong retail comparable store sales in our pro categories  including plumbing  electrical and hardware in fiscal the impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal retail comparable store sales growth 
as of the end of fiscal  certain new stores cannibalized approximately of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal retail comparable store sales by approximately 
the growth in net sales for fiscal also reflects growth in services revenue  which increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal the growth in services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops  roofing  kitchens  windows and hvac 
gross profit gross profit increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales increased basis points to for fiscal  the highest annual rate in our company s history 
our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold  markdowns taken in connection with our decision to close expo stores  the increasing penetration of our hd supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs 
for fiscal  the penetration of our private label credit sales was compared to for fiscal operating expenses operating expenses increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the reduction of sg a as a percent of net sales for fiscal was primarily a result of continued focus on cost take out initiatives and driving productivity gains throughout the company 
we also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card  which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit  like bank cards 
in fiscal  we recorded million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of sg a 
fiscal was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage  and therefore  the amount recognized in fiscal includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program

liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was billion as compared to billion for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of more productive working capital in fiscal net cash used in investing activities increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of an increase in payments for businesses acquired of billion as well as a decrease in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of billion  partially offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures 
we paid billion to complete acquisitions in fiscal  including hughes supply 
our fiscal acquisitions resulted in increases in receivables  merchandise inventories  goodwill  other assets and accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of january  see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion 
additionally in fiscal  we spent billion on capital expenditures  allocated as follows for new stores  for store modernization  for technology and for other initiatives 
in fiscal  we added new stores  including stores in china through our acquisition of the home way  and relocations 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million compared with billion for fiscal the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of billion from the issuance of additional long term debt  partially offset by a net increase of billion in repurchases of common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 
in february  may and august  our board of directors authorized an additional billion  billion and billion  respectively  in our share repurchase program  bringing the total authorization by our board of directors since inception of the program in to billion as of january  pursuant to this authorization  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for a total of billion as of january  during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for billion and during fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for billion

as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility 
the credit facility  which expires in december  contains various restrictions  none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate  including our stores  distribution centers  hd supply locations and store support centers 
the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in long term debt 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of the end of fiscal  our long term debt to equity ratio was compared to at the end of fiscal this increase reflects the net increase in long term debt as a result of the issuance of senior notes in march and december of fiscal as of january   we had million in cash and short term investments 
we believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long term debt payments through the next several fiscal years 
in addition  we have funds available from the billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements

additionally  we have included a commitment to purchase the underlying asset under an off balance sheet lease related to certain stores for million during quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of january  we had  net of discounts  billion of senior notes outstanding 
the market values of the publicly traded senior notes as of january   were approximately billion 
impact of inflation  deflation and changing prices we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products 
during fiscal  lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by approximately basis points 
we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations  we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of estimated returns  at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services 
we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels 
we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns 
we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns 
however  if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts  our sales could be adversely impacted 
when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete 
merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  with approximately valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method 
retailers like the home depot  with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions  frequently use the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  merchandise inventories are stated at cost  which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the consolidated financial statements of the company as of the end of fiscal and fiscal independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store  distribution center and hd supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated 
during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores  we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store by store basis 
shrink or in the case of excess inventory  swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss  inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods  among other things 
we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories 
the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business 
self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  product liability  automobile  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
vendor allowances vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels 
these vendor allowances are accrued as earned  with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases 
we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 
volume rebates and advertising co op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
certain advertising co op allowances that are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses the process of quantifying prior year financial statement misstatements and their impact on current year financial statements 
the provisions of sab allow companies to report the cumulative effect of correcting immaterial prior year misstatements  based on the company s historical method for evaluating misstatements  by adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings in the current year financial statements rather than amending previously filed reports 
sab also requires disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected  how the event arose and the fact that the errors are considered immaterial to the prior year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and therefore was effective for the home depot in fiscal see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax reporting by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that companies recognize tax benefits in their financial statements for a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will therefore be effective for the home depot in fiscal the cumulative impact of adopting fin in fiscal is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition of the company
