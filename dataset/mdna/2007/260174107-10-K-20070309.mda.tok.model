item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion is based upon and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related  broadcasting and other 
admissions includes ticket sales for all our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship fees  luxury suite rentals  hospitality tent rentals and catering  concessions and souvenir sales and vendor commissions for the right to sell concessions and souvenirs at our facilities  sales of programs  track rentals and other event related revenues 
broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for television and radio broadcasts of events held at our speedways and ancillary rights fees 
other revenue includes other miscellaneous revenues 
revenues pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held 
concession revenue from concession stand sales and sales of souvenirs are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues and related expenses from barter transactions in which we receive advertising or other goods or services in exchange for sponsorships of motorsports events are recorded at fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for advertising barter transactions 
barter transactions accounted for   and  of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses that are not directly related to a specific event are recorded as incurred 
expenses that specifically relate to an event are deferred until the event is held  at which time they are expensed 
our expenses include prize and point fund monies and sanction fees paid to various sanctioning bodies  including nascar  labor  advertising  cost of goods sold for merchandise and souvenirs  and other expenses associated with the promotion of our racing events 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted fifteen major events during and the  decrease resulted from lower admissions revenue at nine of the fifteen major events we promoted in as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in attendance attributable to inclement weather 
event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily due to the lack of a title sponsor for our september nextel cup series event at dover international speedway 
broadcasting revenue was  in as compared to  in the  increase resulted primarily from higher television broadcasting rights related to our nascar sanctioned events promoted during pursuant to the terms of our sanction agreements  nascar retains of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar nextel cup series or nascar busch series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining to the event promoter  which we record as revenue 
other revenue was  in as compared to  in the decrease resulted from lower revenues related to the rental of our aircraft and from the rental of our gateway facility for parking area 
operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the  increase primarily related to higher operating and marketing expenses at our major motorsports events  most notably an increase in contractually specified sanction fees and purse expenses 
during the third quarter of  we reviewed the long lived assets of each of our three midwest facilities for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded non cash impairment charges of   and  to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our nashville  memphis and gateway facilities  respectively  to fair value 
based on the factors related to the long lived assets impairment  we completed an assessment of goodwill for potential impairment and determined that there was an impairment loss related to the goodwill balance of  associated with the midwest operations 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write down to zero the carrying value of our goodwill 
additionally  we entered into an agreement of sale on october  that indicated that the fair value of our corporate aircraft was less than its carrying value of  as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  in the third quarter of to write down the carrying amount of our corporate aircraft to fair value 
general and administrative expenses were  in as compared to  in the  decrease resulted primarily from lower wages and benefits costs and legal expenses 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in stock based compensation expense from the adoption of fasb statement no 
r effective january  depreciation and amortization expense was  in as compared to  in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in our depreciable asset base from the impairment charge discussed above 
net interest expense was  in as compared to  in the increase resulted primarily from higher average outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities during as compared to used to primarily fund our self tender in the third quarter of the loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit was  in as compared to earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense of  in the loss resulted from the aforementioned non cash impairment charges of  during  we redeemed  of our outstanding swida bonds and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of  we believe that excluding the impact of these items will enhance comparative analysis of our operating results 
the following table reconciles and compares results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap for and with results excluding the non cash impairment charges and the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt gaap loss earnings from continuing operations before income taxes non cash impairment charges loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes gaap loss earnings from continuing operations non cash impairment charges  net of income tax benefit of  loss on extinguishment of debt  net of income tax benefit of  adjusted earnings from continuing operations gaap loss earnings from continuing operations per common share diluted non cash impairment charges  net of income tax benefit of loss on extinguishment of debt  net of income tax benefit of adjusted earnings from continuing operations per common share diluted excluding the non cash impairment charges and the loss on extinguishment of debt  our adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased  to  in as compared to  in adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased  to  in as compared to  in the decrease was due mainly to a change in our effective income tax rate  as discussed below  partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses 
our effective income tax rates related to continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate from the comparable period in the prior year is due primarily to the fact that the recording of the non cash impairment charges during the third quarter of resulted in minimal state income tax benefit based upon the valuation allowances that we have recorded in connection with state net operating loss carryforwards 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted fifteen major events during and the  increase resulted from higher admissions revenue at twelve of the fifteen major events we promoted in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in attendance 
event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily due to a decrease in hospitality revenue at most of the nascar sanctioned events we promoted in as compared to because fewer corporate customers purchased hospitality packages in broadcasting revenue was  in as compared to  in the increase resulted from higher television broadcasting rights related to our nascar sanctioned events promoted during pursuant to the terms of our sanction agreements  nascar retains of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar nextel cup series or nascar busch series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining to the event promoter  which we record as revenue 
other revenue was  in as compared to  in the increase resulted from revenues related to the rental of our aircraft and from the rental of our gateway facility for parking area 
operating and marketing expenses increased by  or  in as compared to the increase primarily related to higher operating and marketing expenses at our major motorsports events  most notably a  increase in sanction fees and purse expenses and a  increase in advertising and promotion expenses due to an increase in the amount of our advertising 
general and administrative expenses increased  from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to higher wages and fringe benefit costs including stock based compensation and pension costs 
general and administrative expenses in included  for a legal claim 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  from  in to  in  primarily due to assets being placed in service related to the installation of steel and foam energy reduction system safer barriers at all of our facilities 
net interest expense was  in as compared to  in in may  we received  of interest from the internal revenue service related to an income tax refund for prior years 
during  the average outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities decreased and we reversed  of interest that was accrued in related to a judgment that was settled in for less than originally anticipated 
on october   midwest racing redeemed  of the outstanding swida bonds for  including a  premium to the bondholders  plus accrued interest 
we wrote off  of deferred bond costs as a result of the redemption 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of  we believe that excluding the impact of this item will enhance comparative analysis of our operating results 
the following table reconciles and compares results reported in accordance with gaap for and with results excluding the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt gaap earnings from continuing operations before income taxes loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes gaap earnings from continuing operations loss on extinguishment of debt  net of income tax benefit of  adjusted earnings from continuing operations gaap earnings from continuing operations per common share diluted loss on extinguishment of debt  net of income tax benefit of adjusted earnings from continuing operations per common share diluted excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt  adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased  or  to  in as compared to  in  and adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased  or  to  in as compared to  in the increase was due mainly to an improvement in operating results for twelve of the fifteen major events we promoted during  partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expense and depreciation expense 
our effective income tax rates related to continuing operations remained relatively similar for and at and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our operations are seasonal in nature with a majority of our motorsports events occurring during the second and third quarters 
however  our cash flows from operating activities are more evenly spread throughout the year  primarily due to the impact of advance ticket sales and other event related cash receipts  such as sponsorship and luxury suite rentals 
the non cash impairment charges we recorded in the third quarter of had no impact on our liquidity for the year ended december  as discussed in note impairment charges of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  the cost approach utilized for the valuation of our midwest facilities long lived assets assumed that these three facilities will continue to operate as racetracks and that is our present intention 
these facilities have generated negative cash flows for several years and we expect that these negative cash flows will continue at a declining rate as we monitor industry and busch series changes made by nascar while continuing to reduce operating expenses and increase revenues 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was  in as compared to  in and  in the decrease in was primarily due to the timing of invoicing to and receipts from customers and the timing of invoicing from and payments to vendors 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was  in as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of  in capital expenditures were  in  down from  in the additions related primarily to the construction of new luxury skybox suites and the renovation of other fan amenities at our dover facility 
the additions related primarily to the purchase of property adjacent to our dover facility and the installation of safer barriers at all of our tracks 
proceeds from the sale of our corporate aircraft  net of transaction costs  were  in proceeds from the sale of assets of our midwest racing subsidiary  net of transaction costs  were  in net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was  in as compared to  in we made net repayments on our outstanding line of credit of  in as compared to net borrowings of  in the net borrowings in along with the proceeds from the sale of assets of our midwest racing subsidiary were used primarily to fund stock repurchases under our self tender of  and to redeem debt for  we paid  in cash dividends in as compared to  in in  we used  to purchase and retire  shares of our outstanding common stock 
on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on both classes of common stock of per share 
the dividend is payable on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  at december   dover motorsports  inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries  as co borrowers  are parties to a  unsecured revolving credit agreement  as amended effective november   with a bank group that expires july  provisions of the credit agreement adjust it to  on july  the facility provides for seasonal funding needs  capital improvements  letter of credit requirements and other general corporate purposes 
interest is based  at our option  upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization the leverage ratio or the base rate the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio  except that the base rate option is not available for the portion of indebtedness equal to the notional amount under the interest rate swap agreement described below 
the terms of the credit facility contain certain covenants including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the credit facility also provides that if we default under any other loan agreement  that would be a default under this credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of the facility 
material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
there was  outstanding under the facility at december   at a weighted average interest rate of 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  borrowings of  were available pursuant to the facility at december  based on operating results to date and projected future results  we expect to be in compliance with all of the covenants for all measurement periods over the next twelve months 
industry wide live broadcast revenue will be approximately lower in than it was in based on our sanction agreements with nascar  our live broadcast revenues will be approximately  lower than in  consequently impacting our liquidity in the form of lower cash receipts 
this will be partially offset by lower purses payable to nascar  approximately  lower in than in effective october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  thereby hedging against the impact of potential interest rate changes 
the notional amount of the swap agreement decreased to  on november   and decreases to  on november  and to  on november  the agreement terminates on november  under this agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate of 
in return  the issuing lender refunds to us the variable rate interest paid to the bank group under our revolving credit agreement on the same notional principal amount  excluding the margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and maintenance of a dividend  if any  is expected to generate between  in excess cash in based on current business conditions  we expect to spend approximately  on capital expenditures during these expenditures primarily relate to the construction of new luxury skybox suites and renovations to existing skybox suites at our dover facility and other fan amenities 
on may   we announced plans for a five year capital improvement project  referred to as the monster makeover  that will provide new offerings and upgraded amenities for fans  competitors and the media 
the project is expected to take up to five years to complete at an estimated total cost of approximately  of which  was spent as of december  additionally  we expect to contribute  to our pension plans in we expect continued cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit agreement to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through the next twelve months  as well as any cash dividends our board of directors may declare  and also provide for our long term liquidity 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments payments due by period total thereafter revolving line of credit swida bonds total debt estimated interest payments on revolving line of credit interest payments on swida bonds operating leases pension contributions total contractual cash obligations the future interest payments on our revolving credit agreement were estimated using the current outstanding principal as of december  and related interest rates 
although we have no required minimum contribution related to our pension plans for  we expect to contribute approximately  into the plans 
we have a  revolving line of credit agreement 
at december    was outstanding under the facility 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  borrowings of  were available pursuant to the facility at december  in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding at december  principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
we believe that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will continue to satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during the year ended december   we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility  the bonds would become our liability 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
in  midwest racing entered into an agreement with swida to receive the proceeds from the taxable sports facility revenue bonds  series gateway international motorsports corporation project  a municipal bond offering  in the aggregate principal amount of  of which  was outstanding at december  swida loaned all of the proceeds from the municipal bond offering to midwest racing for the purpose of the redevelopment  construction and expansion of gateway  and the proceeds of the swida bonds were irrevocably committed to complete construction of gateway  to fund interest  to create a debt service reserve fund and to pay for the cost of issuance of the bonds 
the repayment terms and debt service reserve requirements of the bonds issued in the municipal bond offering correspond to the terms of the swida bonds 
the bonds are being amortized through february we have established certain restricted cash funds to meet debt service as required by the swida bonds  which are held by the trustee bny trust company of missouri 
at december    of our cash balance was restricted by the swida bonds and is appropriately classified as a non current asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
the swida bonds are secured by a first mortgage lien on all the real property owned and a security interest in all property leased by gateway 
also  the swida bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by midwest racing 
the swida bonds bear interest at varying rates ranging from to with an effective rate of approximately 
interest expense related to the swida bonds was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on october   midwest racing redeemed  of the outstanding swida bonds for  including a  premium to the bondholders  plus accrued interest 
we wrote off  of deferred bond costs as a result of the redemption 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of  an existing stand by letter of credit was reduced to  as a result of the redemption  which is secured by a trust deed on our facilities in memphis  tennessee  and is available to satisfy debt service reserve fund obligations 
in addition  a portion of the property taxes to be paid by gateway if any to the city of madison tax incremental fund have been pledged to the annual retirement of debt and payment of interest

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our valuation allowance was  which increased by  in  on deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carry forwards 
we have considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
we perform reviews for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
generally  fair value is determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows and the use of outside independent valuations  as appropriate

factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to our financial condition  profitability  liquidity  resources  business outlook  proposed acquisitions  market forces  corporate strategies  consumer preferences  contractual commitments  legal matters  capital requirements and other matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors stability and viability of sanctioning bodies  success of or changes in our growth strategies  development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the motorsports industry  patron demographics  obtaining favorable contracts relative to sponsorships  event sanctions and broadcast rights  relationships with sanctioning bodies  sponsors  broadcast media  drivers and teams  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  ability to finance future business requirements  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  the effect of weather conditions on outdoor event attendance  military or other government actions  availability of air travel  and national or local catastrophic events 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our relationships with and the success of various sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon the success of various governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events and our ability to secure favorable contracts with and maintain a good working relationship with these sanctioning bodies  including nascar  irl and nhra 
sanctioning bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis with no contractual obligation to renew  including our agreements with nascar 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
our success is directly tied to our ability to negotiate favorable terms to our sanction agreements  including the amount of the sanction fee and purse  and our ability to continue to derive economic benefits from such agreements  such as our share of live broadcast revenues 
our ability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to negotiate favorable terms to our sanction agreements and the success of a particular sanctioning body in attracting drivers and teams  signing series sponsors and negotiating favorable television and or radio broadcast rights is dependent on many factors which are largely outside of our control 
as our success depends on the terms of our sanction agreements and the success of each event or series that we are promoting  a material change in the terms of a sanction agreement or a material adverse effect on a sanctioning body  such as the loss or defection of top drivers  the loss of significant series sponsors  or the failure to obtain favorable broadcast coverage or to properly advertise the event or series could result in a reduction in our revenues from live broadcast coverage  admissions  luxury suite rentals  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events and our permanent venues  such as title  official product and promotional partner sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our existing title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are in negotiations with various potential sponsors for our events  including title sponsors for our two nascar nextel cup series events and two nascar busch series events at dover international speedway 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for promotions and sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in revenue bonds to build local infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding on december  debt service on the bonds is payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during the year ended december   we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the event the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
we would be responsible to reimburse the banks for any drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to six nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in june and september 
this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are issued on a non refundable basis  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales and concessions and souvenir sales  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us if one of our events is postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in this country following the september  terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we could incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues  including live broadcast revenues associated with the event 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar nextel cup series or nascar busch series  we could experience a reduction in the amount of money received from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation  and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in broadcast revenues greater than the amount scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event 
due to our concentrated stock ownership  stockholders may have no effective voice in our management we have elected to be treated as a controlled corporation as defined by new york stock exchange rule a 
we are a controlled corporation because a single person  henry b 
tippie  the chairman of our board of directors  controls in excess of fifty percent of our voting power 
this means that he has the ability to determine the outcome of the election of directors at our annual meetings and to determine the outcome of many significant corporate transactions  many of which only require the approval of a majority of our voting power 
such a concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us at a premium 
in addition  as a controlled corporation  we are not required to comply with certain new york stock exchange rules 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   there was  outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears interest at our option  upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio or the base rate the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
historically  we managed our mix of fixed and variable rate debt by structuring the terms of our debt agreements 
effective october   we entered into a  interest rate swap agreement effectively converting this portion of the outstanding variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement to fixed rate securities  thereby hedging against the impact of potential interest rate changes 
under this agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate of 
in return  the issuing lender refunds to us the variable rate interest paid to the bank group under our revolving credit agreement on the same notional principal amount  excluding the margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
the notional amount of the swap agreement decreased to  on november   and decreases to  on november  and to  on november  the agreement terminates on november  as of december   the interest rate swap had a fair value of  an increase in interest rates of one percent would result in the interest rate swap having a value of approximately  at december  a decrease in interest rates of one percent would result in the interest rate swap being reported as a liability of approximately  at december  a change in interest rates will have no impact on the interest expense associated with the  of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement that are subject to the interest rate swap agreement 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at december  not subject to the interest rate swap would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at the variable rate described above and therefore approximate fair value at december  at december   our outstanding balance of the swida bonds had a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  the fair value was determined based on recent arms length transactions 
in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  of which  was outstanding at december  these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  however  we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant change in interest rates could result in our being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility
