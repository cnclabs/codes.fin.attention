overview of business segments we have two reportable business segments direct selling and contract manufacturing 
direct selling the direct selling segment represents our principal line of business developing  manufacturing  and distributing premium science based nutritional and personal care products 
under this segment  we sell products from two primary product lines usana nutritionals  which includes high quality supplements and functional foods  and sens beautiful science sens  a unique line of skin and personal care products 
we also offer sales and marketing tools designed to assist our associates in building their businesses and selling our products  as well as combination packs  which include a variety of products from each product line 
in  usana nutritionals and sens product lines represented approximately and of product sales in this segment  respectively 
sales from other items  the majority of which include marketing and sales tools  accounted for the remaining of product sales in this segment during our top selling products as a percent of product sales in this segment during were usana essentials at  healthpak at  and proflavanol at  all of which are part of the usana nutritionals product line 
we keep our product lines focused and compact by limiting them to include only science based products that we believe can provide health benefits to a significant percentage of our customers 
additionally  while not required  our products are designed  manufactured  packaged  and labeled by us at levels that we believe are consistent with the more rigorous pharmaceutical standards 
we distribute and sell our products through a network marketing system using independent distributors that we refer to as associates 
we also sell products directly to preferred customers who purchase our products for personal use and are not permitted to resell or distribute the products 
associates not only purchase product for their own consumption  but are also encouraged to build and manage their own sales force by recruiting  managing  and training others to sell our products 
associates are compensated on sales generated by their business group  or downline 
associates can also receive compensation by purchasing products at wholesale prices and selling them at retail prices 
we consider our high quality products  compact product lines  rewarding compensation plan  distributor support  and weekly associate incentive payments to be attractive components of the usana network marketing system 
we believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person to person product education  which is not readily available through traditional distribution channels 
additionally  we feel that network marketing appeals to a broad cross section of people  particularly those seeking to supplement their income  start a home based business  or pursue entrepreneurial opportunities other than conventional full time employment 
our products are distributed and sold in the united states  canada  and mexico  which we define as our north american region  and australia new zealand  hong kong  japan  taiwan  south korea  and singapore  which we define as our asia pacific region 
we commenced operations in malaysia on january   and will include this country as part of our asia pacific region in currently  a significant portion of net segment sales are concentrated in the north america region  representing of net segment sales in  however  we believe that over time the asia pacific region will continue to account for an increasing proportion of total net segment sales 
as the size of our international markets increase  our operating results will become more sensitive to economic and political conditions in foreign markets  as well as foreign currency fluctuations 
our markets outside of the united states contributed to net segment sales in as follows canada mexico australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea singapore net sales reported for each operating region within this segment are determined by the location from which the product shipment originates and are reported for the last three fiscal years  along with other segment financial information  in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
regional sales are further broken down in item of this report 
the direct selling segment contributed million  or  to consolidated net sales during the year ended december  contract manufacturing operations for the contract manufacturing segment are principally conducted in a facility located in draper  utah  and consist of the manufacture of the company s sens line of skin and personal care products  as well as contract manufacturing services provided to a limited number of external customers 
we acquired this facility with the purchase of wasatch products development  inc in july as part of a vertical integration strategy that allowed us to bring the production of our sens product line in house 
in october  we completed the acquisition of a manufacturing facility in tianjin  china 
this facility does not currently manufacture any usana products and provides minimal services to third party customers 
the contract manufacturing segment contributed million  or  to consolidated net sales during the year ended december  our contract manufacturing facility located in draper  utah accounted for of net segment sales during the year  and the manufacturing facility in china accounted for the remaining of net segment sales 
net sales for this segment for the last three fiscal years are reported  along with other segment financial information  in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
industry overview as both a manufacturer and a direct seller of nutritional and personal care products  we compete within two industries nutrition and direct selling 
the nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to maintain the body s health and general well being  including the following nutritional supplements products such as vitamins and minerals  specialty supplements  herbs and botanicals  meal replacements  dietary supplements  and compounds derived from the aforementioned  natural and organic foods products such as cereals  milk  non dairy beverages  and frozen entrees  functional foods products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes  and natural personal care products combining nutrition with skin care 
the most recent global nutrition industry statistics published by the nutrition business journal nbj appear in their october november issue 
in this issue  nbj reported that global nutrition industry sales reached over billion for the year according to nbj  of that billion  nutritional supplements contributed billion  natural organic foods billion  functional foods billion  and natural personal care billion 
in their june july issue  nbj reported that nutrition industry sales in the united states  which is currently our largest market  reached billion in  of which nutritional supplements contributed billion  natural organic foods billion  functional foods billion  and natural personal care billion 
we believe that the following factors drive growth in the nutrition industry the general public s heightened awareness and understanding of the connection between diet and health  the aging population in most of our markets  particularly the baby boomer generation  which tends to use more nutritional supplementation as it ages  rising health care costs and the worldwide trend toward preventative health care  and product introductions in response to new scientific findings 
nutritional products are distributed through six major sales channels 
each channel has changed in recent years  primarily due to advances in technology and communications that have resulted in improved product distribution and faster dissemination of information 
the major sales channels are as follows mass market retailers  including mass merchandisers  drug stores  supermarkets  and discount stores  natural health food retailers  network marketing  mail order  healthcare professionals and practitioners  and the internet 
we distribute our products through a network marketing system  which is a common form of direct selling 
according to the world federation of direct selling associations wfdsa  the direct selling industry currently generates approximately billion annually in worldwide retail sales  with approximately million independent distributors 
according to wfdsa international statistics  the united states remains the largest market for direct selling  with billion in annual retail sales and million independent distributors 
according to the direct selling association  wellness products  which include nutritional supplements and functional foods  account for  and personal care products account for  of us direct retail sales 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on growth trends in direct sales  as both a developer and manufacturer of nutritional supplements and personal care products  utilizing our network marketing distribution system 
operating strengths our principal objective is to be a leading developer  manufacturer  and distributor of science based nutritional and personal care products 
our strategy to achieve this objective is to capitalize on our operating strengths  which include our development and sale of science based products  our strong research and development capability  our in house manufacturing capacity  our rewarding compensation plan for associates  our scalable business model  and our experienced management team 
science based products 
we have developed a very focused and compact line of high quality health products that we believe can provide health benefits to a significant percentage of our customers 
our products have been developed based upon a combination of published research  in vitro and in vivo testing  in house and third party clinical studies  and sponsored research 
additionally  our products are designed  manufactured  packaged  and labeled by us at levels that we believe are consistent with pharmaceutical standards 
emphasis on research and development 
we have a technical team of approximately individuals that contribute to our research and development activities 
this team includes experienced scientists  including six scientists holding phd degrees  quality engineers  and regulatory specialists 
in our research and development laboratories  our scientists and researchers investigate in vitro and in vivo activity of new natural extracts and formulated products  identify and research combinations of nutrients that may be candidates for new products  develop new nutritional ingredients for use in supplements  study the metabolic activity of existing and newly identified nutritional ingredients  enhance existing products  as new discoveries in nutrition and skin care are made  and formulate products to meet regulatory requirements in all of our markets 
in addition  we perform double blind  placebo controlled  clinical studies intended to further evaluate the efficacy of our products 
it is through our research and development efforts that we can provide what we believe to be some of the highest quality health products in the industry 
in house manufacturing 
we now manufacture products that account for approximately of product sales in our direct selling segment 
we believe that our ability to manufacture our own products is a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons we can better control the quality of raw materials and the purity and potency of finished products  we can more reliably monitor the manufacturing process to reduce the risk of product contamination  we are able to produce most of our own prototypes in the research phase of product development  and we believe we can better manage the underlying costs associated with manufacturing our products 
attractive associate compensation plan and benefits 
we are committed to providing a highly competitive compensation plan to attract and retain associates who constitute our sales force 
we believe the usana associate compensation plan the compensation plan is one of the most financially rewarding in the network marketing industry 
associate incentives totaled million  or of net sales for the direct selling segment in we pay associate incentives weekly and our compensation plan is a global seamless plan  meaning that associates can be compensated each week for their business success in any market in which we conduct business 
to support our associates  we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year  which offer information about our products and our network marketing system 
these meetings are designed to assist associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with successful associates and the usana management team 
we also provide low cost sales tools  which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home based business for associates 
scalable business model 
our business model does not require a company employed sales force to sell our products 
we experience minimal incremental cost to add a new associate in the markets where we operate 
additionally  commissions paid to associates are tied to sales performance 
since payment is required at the time an associate purchases product  we have virtually no receivables 
we have a monthly product subscription program known as autoship that provides a stream of recurring revenue 
for the year ended december   approximately of net sales in the direct selling segment came from the autoship program 
another advantage to our business model is that we can expand into new international markets with only moderate investment  as we generally maintain only one administrative and customer support office and one or two warehouses in each of our international markets 
experienced management team 
our management team includes individuals with expertise in various scientific and managerial disciplines  including nutrition  product research and development  international development  marketing  customer network development  information technology  finance  and operations 
the current executive management team has been in place for several years and is responsible for supporting growth and international expansion  strengthening our financial condition  and improving our internal controls 
growth strategy we seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies attract and retain associates and preferred customers 
we recognize the need to continue to attract and retain associates 
we maintain emphasis on the partnership between the usana management team and our associate leaders 
through this partnership  our associate leaders continue to host health freedom meetings and online presentations  both aimed at presenting the business opportunity to potential associates and providing additional training and resources for existing associates 
in addition to our annual international convention and our asia pacific convention  we hold several regional events in key growth areas to provide support and training to new associates in these areas 
we intend to continue growing our business by maintaining a focus on our two core values  true health and true wealth 
we plan to accomplish this by increasing the number of active associates and teaching them how to build a strong customer base 
by leveraging the current growth we have in our associate field  we believe we can continue to attract individuals that are interested in joining a winning team and starting a home based business with usana 
in our training events held during  we focused on the use of sales tools in prospecting  sponsoring  and training new associates  as well as retaining existing associates 
during we were featured in the november issue of success from home magazine  a commercial publication on home based business opportunities 
we purchased large quantities of the november issue of this magazine and priced them for sale to associates at cost 
in an effort to further subsidize the cost to associates of distributing the magazine as a prospecting and marketing tool  we also offer free shipping on our packs of magazines when placed on monthly autoship 
we will continue training our associates on the use of sales tools in building their businesses 
we will also continue to offer innovative contests and promotional incentives that are geared toward those interested in growing their usana businesses to a new level 
we will continue to emphasize sharing usana by educating our associates on ways they can improve their effectiveness in presenting sales tools and product samples to prospects and the steps they can take to follow up with prospects 
we plan to leverage our many accomplishments  positive press  and break through technology to demonstrate our competitive advantages within the industry 
we also believe that actively promoting the success stories of our associates in the field will likely increase rank advancements  the number of associates receiving commissions  and awareness of preventative health 
we intend to improve our training and recognition of associate accomplishments in order to strengthen the commitment and success of our sales force 
moreover  we believe that an increasing interest from business and health care professionals  amateur and professional athletes  clubs  and associations will allow us to reach even more potential customers 
enter new markets 
we believe that significant growth opportunities continue to exist in markets where we currently conduct business and in new international markets 
new markets are selected following an assessment of several factors  including market size  anticipated demand for usana products  receptiveness to network marketing  and the market entry process  which includes consideration of possible regulatory restrictions on our products or our network marketing system 
we have begun to register certain products with regulatory and government agencies in preparation for further international expansion 
wherever possible  we expect to seamlessly integrate the compensation plan in each market to allow associates to receive commissions for global not merely local product sales 
the seamless downline structure is designed to allow an associate to build a global network by creating downlines across national borders 
associates are not required to establish new downlines or to re qualify for higher levels of compensation in newly opened markets 
we believe this seamless compensation plan can significantly enhance our ability to expand internationally  and we intend  where permitted  to integrate future markets into this plan 
our new market focus in will be the development of business in malaysia  where we commenced operations in january of introduce new and re formulate existing products 
our research and development team is continually researching the latest scientific findings related to nutrition  looking at new technology and attending scientific conferences 
if  in the process  we see potential for a new product that provides a true health benefit addressing a particular health issue  and if we believe its benefits can be realized by a significant percentage of our customers  we will generally pursue development of that product 
during we introduced a new optimizer supplement  tenx antioxidant blast  a unique dietary supplement fruit bar that provides the equivalent of two fruit servings and is fortified with important antioxidants  including quercetin and our patented olive fruit extract  olivol 
if in the process of our research activities mentioned above  our research and development team identifies a new or existing ingredient that could possibly be used to enhance one of our existing products  we will generally pursue a product upgrade 
our intention is to ensure that all of our products  new and existing  incorporate the latest science in nutrition 
such is the case with the usana essentials  which we upgraded and began selling to customers in the fourth quarter of pursue strategic acquisitions 
we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities may arise in the future 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that would grow our customer base  expand our product lines  enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise  allow vertical integration  or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals 
products our primary product lines within the direct selling segment consist of usana nutritionals and sens 
the usana nutritionals product line is further categorized into three separate classifications essentials  optimizers  and macro optimizers

all other in addition to these principal product lines  we develop and sell materials and online tools designed to assist our associates in building their businesses and marketing our products 
these resource materials and sales tools include product brochures and business forms that are designed by us internally and printed by outside publishers 
our wholly owned subsidiary  fmg productions  now doing business as usana studios  also produces multimedia tools including cds and dvds 
in addition  we occasionally provide reprints of other commercial publications that feature usana and may be used as a sales tool 
for example  in september we purchased large quantities of the november issue of success from home magazine  featuring usana  to resell to our associates 
additionally  we periodically contract with authors and publishers to produce or provide books  tapes  and other items dealing with health topics and personal motivation  which we then sell to associates 
new associates are required to purchase a starter kit  which contains usana training materials that help associates begin to build their businesses 
associates do not earn commissions on the sale of starter kits or sales tools 
the following table summarizes the approximate percentages of total product revenue for the direct selling segment that were contributed by our major product lines for the last three fiscal years sales by product line year ended product line usana nutritionals essentials optimizers macro optimizers sens beautiful science all other the essentials category under the usana nutritionals product line includes usana essentials  healthpak  body rox  and usanimals 
key products the following highlights sales data for our top selling products as a percentage of direct selling segment product sales for the last three fiscal years 
year ended usana essentials healthpack proflavanol research and development we focus our research and development efforts on developing and providing the highest quality  science based products that reduce the risk of chronic degenerative disease and promote long term health 
our research and development activities include developing products that are new to usana and new to the industry  updating existing formulas to keep them current with the latest science  and adapting existing formulas to meet ever changing regulations in new and existing international markets 
our scientists are continually reviewing the latest published research on nutrition  attending scientific conferences  and working in collaboration with a number of outside research institutions and researchers to identify new product possibilities and opportunities to reformulate existing products 
our goal is to maintain a very sharp focus on inner and outer nutrition and prevention of chronic degenerative diseases and healthy weight management 
since we believe in focusing on key health issues within our society rather than on fads  we do not introduce a new product unless we believe it can provide health benefits to a significant percentage of our customers 
as a result  we maintain a very focused and compact line of products  which we believe is easier for our associates to manage and also easier from an inventory management perspective 
we follow pharmaceutical standards established by the us pharmacopeia in the development and reformulation of our products 
our ingredients are selected to meet a number of criteria  including  but not limited to safety  potency  purity  stability  bioavailability  natural versus synthetic  and whether the ingredients are readily available 
we control the quality of our products beginning at the development stage  and maintain our quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients  manufacturing  packaging  and labeling 
in fiscal years   and  we expended million  million  and million  respectively  on company sponsored research and development activities 
we intend to continue dedicating resources at similar levels for the research and development of new products and the reformulation of existing products 
manufacturing and quality assurance tablet manufacturing is conducted at our salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility 
the production process for tablet based products includes identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials  acquiring raw materials  analyzing raw material quality  weighing or otherwise measuring the raw materials  mixing raw materials into batches  forming the mixtures into tablets  coating and sorting the tablets  analyzing tablet quality  packaging finished products  and analyzing finished product quality 
our tablet manufacturing process uses automatic and semi automatic equipment 
we conduct sample testing of raw materials and finished products for purity  potency  and composition that conforms to strict specifications 
constructed in  the tablet production facility is registered with the us food and drug administration fda and health canada  and has been inspected and certified by the australian therapeutic goods administration tga 
at this time in the united states  the manufacture of nutritional supplements and related products requires compliance with food model good manufacturing practice regulations gmp s 
we believe that our processes comply with the fda s more demanding drug level gmp s 
the certification by the tga denotes compliance with that agency s drug model gmp s 
in addition to tablet manufacturing  we also manufacture premium personal care products at our draper  utah manufacturing facility  which we acquired in july of as part of a vertical integration strategy to bring the production of our sens product line in house 
contract manufacturing services are also provided to a limited number of third party customers through this facility 
during  we completed construction upgrades to our draper facility that were designed to conform it to the fda s gmp s 
the production process for personal care products includes identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials  acquiring raw materials  analyzing raw material quality  weighing or otherwise measuring the raw materials  mixing raw materials into batches  analyzing liquid batch quality  packaging finished products  and analyzing finished product quality 
our draper manufacturing facility is registered with the fda as a pharmaceutical facility  consistent with a facility that manufactures over the counter personal care products 
the facility has standard technology for producing batches of personal care items and semi automatic packaging equipment for packaging the end product 
it employs qualified staff to develop  implement  and maintain a quality system that we believe is consistent with requirements under drug level gmp s 
we contract with third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products 
these third party suppliers and manufacturers produce and  in most cases  package these products according to formulations developed by or in conjunction with our in house product development team 
products currently supplied through third parties include gelatin capsuled supplements  garlic ec  optomega  certain powdered drink mixes  and bars 
we conduct quality control processes in two in house laboratories located in salt lake city  utah 
in the microbiology laboratory  scientists test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods 
in the analytical chemistry laboratory  scientists test for chemical contamination and accurate active ingredient levels of raw materials and finished products 
both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine product shelf life 
our laboratory staff also performs chemical assays on vitamin and mineral constituents under united states pharmacopoeia methods and other internally validated methods 
in addition to the quality control and clinical laboratories  our headquarters facility also houses a laboratory designated for research and development 
most of the raw ingredients used in the manufacture of our products  for both the direct selling and contract manufacturing segments  are available from a number of suppliers 
we have not generally experienced difficulty in obtaining necessary quantities of raw ingredients 
when supplies of certain raw materials have tightened  we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials  as needed  and believe we will be able to do so in the future  if the need arises 
in  we began experiencing a shortage in supply of one of our raw materials  coenzyme q coq 
at that time awareness of the benefits derived from coq had increased significantly  causing a sharp increase in demand and a subsequent shortage in supply 
although we had qualified multiple sources for this raw ingredient  the increased demand coupled with a supply shortage resulted in the purchase price on this raw ingredient increasing significantly throughout and the first part of by mid some suppliers had re tooled their manufacturing facilities to increase production capacity of coq  and more competitors entered the market  which has caused supply to increase and purchase prices to decline 
our salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility has five kitting or dispensing rooms  four large blenders  seven production tablet presses  three coaters  four sorting lines  two bottling lines  and two pillow pack lines 
we currently operate two ten hour shifts  four days per week 
there is  however  no restriction from processes or equipment to add an additional shift for increased capacity 
based on equipment capacity and current product mix  the average manufacturing and packaging utilization rate is at approximately of capacity  assuming two ten hour shifts  four days per week 
our draper  utah manufacturing facility currently produces an average of million filled containers per annum 
assuming two ten hour shifts per day  four days per week  the facility uses approximately of manufacturing and packaging capacity 
distribution and marketing we distribute products through a network marketing system  which is a form of person to person direct selling through a network of vertically organized independent distributors who purchase products at wholesale prices from the manufacturer and then make retail sales to consumers 
the emergence of readily available means of mass communication  such as personal computers  facsimiles  low cost long distance telephone services  satellite conferencing and the internet  has contributed to the rapid growth of network marketing 
the concept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends  neighbors  relatives  and close acquaintances 
we believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person to person product education  which is not as readily available through other distribution channels 
a person who wishes to sell usana products must join our independent sales force as an associate 
a person becomes an associate by completing an application under the sponsorship of an existing associate 
the new associate then becomes part of the sponsoring associate s downline sales organization 
new associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to the usana policies and procedures 
new associates are also required to purchase a starter kit that includes a detailed manual  including our policies and procedures 
starter kits are sold at our cost for a price of approximately we also offer starter kits in an electronic format at a lower price  which are also sold at our cost 
subject to payment of an annual renewal fee  associates may continue to distribute products until they voluntarily withdraw or are terminated 
initial training of associates about the products  the compensation plan  network marketing  and about usana is provided primarily by an associate s sponsor and others in their sales organization 
in addition  we develop and sell training materials and sales tools to assist associates in building their businesses 
we also provide reprints from other commercial publications that feature usana and may be used as a sales tool 
we also periodically sponsor and conduct regional  national  and international associate events and intensive leadership training seminars 
attendance at these sessions is voluntary  and we undertake no generalized effort to provide individualized training to associates  although experience shows that the most effective and successful associates participate in training activities 
associates may not sell competitive products to other usana associates or solicit usana associates to participate in other network marketing opportunities 
our policies and procedures also restrict associates advertising and representations or claims concerning usana products or the compensation plan 
the compensation plan provides several opportunities for associates to earn compensation  provided they are willing to consistently work at building  training  and retaining their downline organizations to sell usana products to consumers 
we believe this compensation plan is distinctive for its weekly distributions and equitable payouts  which are designed to create appropriate incentives for the sale of usana products 
associates cannot simply recruit others for the purpose of developing a downline and earn income passively  depending solely on the efforts of their downline 
each associate is required to purchase a certain amount of product each month qualifying purchases  which they must either resell to consumers or personally use  in order to be qualified to earn commissions or bonuses under usana s compensation plan 
associates do not earn commissions on these qualifying purchases 
the purpose of our compensation plan is to reward associates for actively selling our products and for recruiting and retaining others to sell our products 
associates can earn compensation primarily in four ways generating sales volume points based on product sales of their downline sales organization  participating in a leadership bonus pool based on certain performance requirements  purchasing products at wholesale prices from usana and selling them to consumers at higher retail prices  and through company sponsored promotions and contests 
as an associate successfully expands his or her downline sales organization and as those in the downline also successfully expand  the associate can receive higher commissions 
we endeavor to seamlessly integrate this compensation plan across all markets in which usana products are sold  allowing associates to receive commissions for global not merely local product sales 
this seamless downline structure is designed to allow an associate to build a global network by creating downlines across national borders 
associates may expand their downline organizations into new markets without establishing new downlines or requalifying for higher levels of compensation in the newly opened markets 
we believe this seamless compensation plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally  and we intend  where permitted  to continue to integrate new markets into this plan 
most associates sell our products on a part time basis and consume them personally 
the sponsoring of new associates results in the creation of multiple levels within our network marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as the downline of the sponsoring associate 
downline associates may also sponsor new associates  creating additional levels in their network  but also forming a part of the same downline as the original sponsoring associate 
associates interested in earning additional income who successfully expand their business network or downline can qualify for higher levels of compensation  as well as leadership bonuses  by attaining certain sales volume levels and demonstrating leadership abilities 
we do not pay commissions based on recruiting or sponsorship activity 
we also sell directly to customers who purchase products only for personal consumption 
this program is our preferred customer program 
preferred customers may not resell or distribute the products 
we believe this program gives us access to a market that would otherwise be missed  by targeting customers who enjoy usana products  but who prefer not to maintain a sales  distribution  or other business relationship with usana 
although our policies prohibit preferred customers from engaging in retail sales of products purchased through the program  they may enroll as associates at any time if they desire 
only associates are eligible to earn commissions and participate in the compensation plan 
product returns our product return policy allows retail customers to return the unused portion of any product to the associate who sold them the product for a full cash refund 
we then reimburse our associates upon receipt of proper documentation and the return of the remaining product 
where the consumer of the returned product was an associate or preferred customer  the refund method and amount depend upon the condition of the returned product and the guidelines discussed below 
all returned product within the first days following purchase is refunded at of the sales price to retail customers and preferred customers 
this day return policy is offered to associates only on their first order 
all other returned product that is unused and resalable is refunded up to one year from the date of purchase at of the sales price less a restocking fee 
return of product that was not damaged at the time of receipt by the associate may result in cancellation of the associate s distributorship according to the terms of the associate agreement 
depending upon the conditions under which product was returned  associates and preferred customers may receive their refunded amount either based on their original form of payment or with product or credit on account 
during fiscal years   and returns as a percentage of net sales were   and respectively 
major customers sales in our direct selling segment are made to independent associates and preferred customers 
no single customer accounted for or more of net segment sales in any of the last three fiscal years 
associates are independent contractors and are not agents  employees  or legal representatives of usana 
our employees and affiliates cannot be associates  although there is no prohibition on their family members becoming associates as long as they do not reside in the same household as the employee or affiliate 
associates may sell products only in countries where we have approved the sale of our products 
in the contract manufacturing segment  we had one customer in  and two customers in both and that each accounted for more than of net third party sales 
compliance by associates from time to time associates fail to adhere to the usana policies and procedures  including those governing the marketing of our products or making representations regarding the compensation plan 
we systematically review reports of alleged associate misbehavior 
infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to a compliance committee that determines what disciplinary action may be warranted in each case 
if we determine that an associate has violated any of the usana policies and procedures  we may take a number of disciplinary actions 
for example  we may impose sanctions  such as warnings  fines or probation 
we also may withdraw or deny awards  suspend privileges  withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied  or take other appropriate actions in our discretion 
more serious infractions may result in termination of the associate s purchase and distribution rights completely 
information technology we believe that the ability to efficiently manage distribution  compensation  manufacturing  inventory control  and communications functions through the use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success 
our information technology resources are maintained primarily by our in house staff to optimally support our customer base and core business processes 
this staff manages an array of systems and processes which support global operations hours a day days a year 
three of our critical applications include the following a web based application that provides online services to associates such as trainings and presentations  online shopping  enrollment  company and product information  and other tools to help associates effectively manage their downline organizations 
our web applications are supported by a clustered environment and a redundant system outside of our home office  which serves as a disaster recovery site 
a web enabled order entry system that handles order entry  customer information  compensation  genealogy  returns  invoices  and other transactional based processes 
a fully integrated worldwide enterprise resource planning erp system that handles financial  inventory management  production processes  quality assurance  and reporting requirements in a multinational environment 
this erp system supports global data integrity and multinational corporate governance and compliance 
regulatory matters product regulation 
numerous governmental agencies in the united states and other countries regulate the manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  promoting  distributing  and the selling of nutrition  health  beauty  and weight management products 
in the united states advertisement of our products is regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the ftc act and  where such advertising is considered to be product labeling by the fda  under the food  drug  and cosmetic act fd c and regulations promulgated under that act 
usana products are also subject to regulation by  among others  the consumer product safety commission  the us department of agriculture  and the environmental protection agency 
the manufacturing  labeling  and advertising of products are also regulated by various governmental agencies in each foreign country in which they are distributed 
for example  in australia we are subject to the therapeutic goods administration and in japan to the ministry of health  labor and welfare 
our largest product group in terms of sales includes products that are regulated as dietary supplements under the fd c 
dietary supplements are also regulated in the united states under the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea 
we believe dshea provides a favorable regulatory climate to the dietary supplement industry 
some of our powdered drink  food bar  and other nutrition products are regulated as foods under the nutrition labeling and education act of nlea 
the nlea establishes requirements for ingredient and nutritional labeling and labeling claims for foods 
although we believe our product claims comply with the law  we may need to revise some product labeling at a future date if labeling requirements change 
under these regulations  a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient defined as an ingredient not on the market before october  must have a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe 
the manufacturer must notify the fda at least days before marketing products containing new dietary ingredients and provide the fda with the information upon which the manufacturer based its conclusion that the product has a reasonable expectation of safety 
on march   the fda announced a proposal for new gmp s specific to dietary supplements 
we were hopeful that the fda would release the final gmp s during  however  this did not take place 
although we are unsure of when these final gmp s will be released  we anticipate that the release will be forthcoming in the near future 
these gmp s  if promulgated  may be significantly more rigorous than currently applicable gmp s 
we believe that we currently manufacture our dietary supplement products according to the standards of the fda s pharmaceutical level gmp s 
if new gmp s are adopted  however  we may be required to expend additional capital and resources on manufacturing controls in the future in order to comply with the law 
other products include cosmetics and products that are deemed to be over the counter otc drugs 
in general  our cosmetic products are not subject to pre market approval by the fda 
however  cosmetics are subject to regulation by the fda under the fd c adulteration and misbranding provisions 
cosmetics also are subject to specific labeling regulations  including warning statements  if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately substantiated or if the product may be hazardous  as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under the fair packaging and labeling act 
cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug ie  that are intended to treat or prevent disease or affect the structure or function of the body  such as sunscreens  are regulated as drugs 
otc drug products may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of the otc monograph that is applicable to that drug 
drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved new drug application nda before marketing 
under these provisions  if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our otc drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph applicable to one of our otc drug products  we will have to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved nda or until the time  if ever  that the monograph is amended to include the product 
if such an agency ruling were to become final  we would be required to stop marketing the product as currently formulated 
whether or not an otc drug product conforms to a monograph or is subject to an approved nda  the drug must comply with other requirements under the fdca  including gmp s  labeling  and the fdca s misbranding and adulteration provisions 
advertising of products is subject to regulation by the ftc under the ftc act 
section of the ftc act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce 
section of the ftc act provides that disseminating any false advertisement pertaining to drugs or foods  which would include dietary supplements  is an unfair or deceptive act or practice 
under the ftc s substantiation doctrine  an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made 
failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices 
pursuant to this ftc requirement  we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims made for our products 
in recent years the ftc has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against dietary supplement  weight management  and cosmetic products companies 
the ftc has issued a guidance document to assist companies in understanding and complying with the substantiation requirement 
we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines 
the ftc may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways  both administratively and judicially  using compulsory process  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement can result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  corrective advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
we have not been notified that we were the subject of any action by the ftc  but any action in the future by the ftc could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in june of congress passed the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of bioterrorism act 
several provisions of the bioterrorism act have resulted in additional regulatory compliance issues 
for example  one provision in the bioterrorism act requires the secretary of health and human services to develop regulations that mandate domestic and foreign facilities that manufacture  process  pack  or hold food for human or animal consumption in the united states to register with the fda 
on november   we fulfilled this requirement by registering with the fda 
another provision of the bioterrorism act mandates that the fda receive prior notification of all food importation 
our tenx antioxidant blast is purchased from a manufacturer located in canada  therefore  we are required to comply with this notification requirement upon importation of this product 
although some of our raw materials and other certain manufactured product may originate outside of the united states  we procure these items from entities in the united states 
from time to time we may bring consumable products that we have sent from our salt lake facility to our international locations back into the united states from one or more of these locations 
when bringing these products back into the united states from any international location  we are required to comply with this notification requirement 
on december   president bush signed the dietary supplement nonprescription drug consumer protection act into law 
the legislation requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over the counter products to notify the fda when they receive reports of serious adverse events 
usana already has an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years 
based on our understanding of the new law s requirements  we believe we will have to make some changes to our existing reporting system  but none which we believe will be significant 
we will know more when the fda issues implementing regulations later in and we intend to fully comply 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of usana products for the market or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with local product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
foreign regulatory requirements have not placed a significant burden on our ability to operate in current foreign countries 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
network marketing regulation 
laws and regulations in each country in which we operate prevent the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling and network marketing activities 
these laws include anti pyramiding  securities  lottery  referral selling  anti fraud and business opportunity statutes  regulations  and court cases 
illegal schemes  typically referred to as pyramid  chain distribution  or endless chain schemes  compensate participants primarily or solely for the introduction or enrollment of additional participants into the scheme 
often these schemes are characterized by large up front entry or sign up fees  over priced products of low value  little or no emphasis on the sale or use of products  high pressure recruiting tactics  and claims of huge and quick financial rewards requiring little or no effort 
generally these laws are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within sales organizations is based on sales of the enterprise s products  rather than investments in the organizations or other non retail sales related criteria or activity 
where required by law  we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing system  or  where approval is not required or available  the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance 
in addition to federal regulation in the united states  each state has enacted its own little ftc act to regulate sales and advertising 
occasionally we receive requests to supply information regarding our network marketing plan to regulatory agencies 
although we have from time to time modified our network marketing system to comply with interpretations of various regulatory authorities  we believe that our network marketing program is in compliance with laws and regulations relating to network marketing activities in our current markets 
nevertheless  we remain subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  the marketing system or the conduct of certain associates could be found not to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
failure by an associate or us to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect the way we do business and could affect our ability to attract potential associates or enter new markets 
in the united states  the ftc has been active in its enforcement efforts against both pyramid schemes and legitimate network marketing organizations with certain legally problematic components  having instituted several enforcement actions resulting in signed settlement agreements and payment of large fines 
although to our knowledge we have not been the target of an ftc investigation  there can be no assurance that the ftc will not investigate us in the future 
on april   the ftc released a proposed new business opportunity rule 
the proposed rule would require pre sale disclosures for all business opportunities  which might include network marketing compensation plans 
the new business opportunity rule is currently only a proposed rule 
if implemented at all  the rule ultimately may not be implemented in a form that applies to network marketing compensation plans  or may change significantly before it is implemented 
if the proposed rule were adopted as currently proposed  it will require us to change some of our current practices regarding pre sale disclosures 
we cannot predict the nature of any future law  regulation  interpretation  or application  nor can we predict what effect additional governmental legislation or regulations  judicial decisions  or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
it is possible that future developments may require that we revise our network marketing program 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
transfer pricing regulation 
we have adopted transfer prices  which are supported by a formal transfer pricing study for the sale of products to our subsidiaries in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws 
in addition  agreements between the subsidiaries and the parent corporation have been entered into for services and contractual obligations  such as the payment of associate incentives that are also supported by the same formal transfer pricing study 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our standard transfer pricing practices for products  we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings may be adversely affected if our foreign tax credit was limited on our us tax return 
the tax treaties between the united states and most foreign countries provide for competent authority relief to avoid any double taxation 
we believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing regulations or that those laws will not be modified  which may require changes in our operating procedures 
competition the business of developing and distributing nutritional and personal care products  such as those we sell and distribute  is highly competitive due to the nature of the industry 
the nutritional supplement market is characterized by large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate  retail consumer emphasis on value pricing  changing formulations based on evolving scientific research  low barriers to entry resulting from low brand loyalty  rapid change  widely available manufacturing  low regulatory requirements  and ready access to large distribution channels  and lack of uniform standards for product ingredient sources  potency  purity  absorption rate  and form 
numerous manufacturers  distributors  and retailers compete for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for distributors 
we compete directly with other entities that develop  manufacture  market  and distribute products in each of our product lines 
we compete with these entities by emphasizing the underlying science  value  and superior quality of our products  as well as the convenience and financial benefits afforded by our network marketing system and compensation plan 
however  many of our competitors are substantially larger  have greater financial resources  and have broader name recognition than we have 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete in this intensely competitive environment 
our markets are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture a significant share of those markets 
our product offerings in each product category are relatively few  compared to the wide variety of products offered by many of our competitors  and are often premium priced 
as a result  our ability to remain competitive depends in part upon the successful introduction of new products and enhancements of existing products 
we also compete with other network marketing organizations for the time  attention  and commitment of new and current associates 
our ability to remain competitive in this regard depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
we believe that we offer a rewarding associate compensation plan and attractive associate benefits and services 
to the extent practicable  our associate compensation plan is designed to be seamless  permitting international expansion without re qualification or re entry requirements 
we also pay associate incentives weekly  reducing the time an associate must wait between purchase and sale of products and payment of commissions 
however  there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by network marketing is limited in each market and is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe that we offer an attractive opportunity for our associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
we believe that the leading network marketing company in the world  based on total sales  is amway corporation and its affiliates  and that avon products  inc is the leading direct seller of beauty and related products worldwide 
leading competitors in the nutritional network marketing and nutritional product industry include herbalife  inc  market america  inc  nature s sunshine products  inc  nu skin enterprises  inc  nbty  inc  mannatech  and schiff nutrition international  inc we believe there are other manufacturers of competing product lines that may launch direct selling enterprises  which will compete with us in certain product lines and for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully meet the challenges posed by this increased competition 
although we provide contract manufacturing services to third party customers in our contract manufacturing segment  we are not actively pursuing new clientele 
our primary focus in this segment is the manufacture of the company s sens line of skin and personal care products 
intellectual property trademarks 
we have developed and we use registered trademarks in our business  particularly relating to our corporate and product names 
we own trademarks registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the united states  regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs 
we have filed applications and own trademark registrations  and we intend to register additional trademarks in foreign countries where usana products are or may be sold in the future 
protection afforded to registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection available in the united states 
we also claim ownership and protection of certain product names  unregistered trademarks  and service marks under common law 
common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection afforded by registration of a trademark 
in addition  common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used 
we believe these trademarks  whether registered or claimed under common law  constitute valuable assets  adding to recognition of usana  and the marketing of usana products 
we therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete 
trade secrets 
we own certain intellectual property  including trade secrets  that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties  although some employees involved in research and development activities have not entered into these agreements 
even where these agreements exist  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets  but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws 
patents 
we have two patents  issued in  which will continue in force for years from the date of issue 
these patents are process patents and relate to the method of extracting an antioxidant from olives and the waste products of olive oil production 
in  we entered into a licensing agreement with a supplier to make olive extract using our patented process 
currently  it is very difficult to determine the exact future benefit of these patents 
however  we believe that the patents have the potential to generate additional revenue in the future through new product development and royalties from licensing 
products within the contract manufacturing segment are developed on behalf of customers and are labeled under customer brand names 
we currently do not possess intellectual property claims for products in this segment 
we intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action 
consequently  we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights 
any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel 
seasonality the third quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of each year 
in north america  which represents about two thirds of our consolidated net sales  associate activity tends to slow down as a result of the summer vacation season 
the anticipation for new products introduced at our international convention  held during the third quarter each year  also contributes to the third quarter seasonality 
backlog products sold within the direct selling segment are typically shipped within hours after receipt of the order 
as of february   there was no significant backlog in either the direct selling or contract manufacturing segment 
working capital practices we maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock for our direct selling segment in order to provide a high level of service to associates and preferred customers 
substantial inventories are required to meet the needs of our dual role as manufacturer and distributor 
our contract manufacturing segment maintains adequate amounts of commodity inventory that which can be used for various customers and minimal quantities of specialty inventory that which is ordered specifically for the needs of individual customers to meet customer demand 
we also watch seasonal commodity markets and may buy ahead of normal demand to hedge against cost and supply risks 
environment we are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal  state  or local provisions enacted for or relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject under environmental laws to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations 
employees as of february   we had employees worldwide  as measured by full time equivalency 
our employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have not experienced work stoppages as a result of labor disputes 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good 
additional available information we make available  free of charge at our corporate web site  copies of our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  proxy statements  and all amendments to these reports  as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the sec pursuant to section a or d of the exchange act

item a 
risk factors forward looking statements and certain risks the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements relate to our expectations  hopes  beliefs  commitments  intentions  and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases  such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regarding our financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future  and the sufficiency of our existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward looking statements or for the reasons discussed below 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to past reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report  and we assume no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in these forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations include the following as a network marketing company  we are dependent upon an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products 
we rely on non employee  independent associates to purchase  market  and sell our products 
associates are independent contractors who purchase products directly for their own use or for resale 
associates typically work at the distribution of the products on a part time basis and may and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with us 
we have a large number of associates and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support to our associates 
we undertake minimal effort to provide individual training to associates 
associates may voluntarily terminate their agreements with us at any time 
there is typically significant turnover in associates from year to year 
because of this high turnover we must continually recruit new associates 
our net sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of these non employee  independent associates 
future growth in sales volume will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new associates and improving the productivity of associates 
if the number or productivity of independent associates does not increase  our revenue will not increase 
to increase revenue  we must increase the number and or the productivity of our associates 
we can provide no assurances that the number of associates will increase or remain constant  or that their productivity will increase 
we experienced a   and increase in active associates during   and  respectively 
the number of active associates may not increase and could decline in the future 
associates may terminate their services at any time  and  like most direct selling companies  we experience a high turnover among associates from year to year 
we cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of associates because we primarily rely upon existing associates to sponsor and train new associates and to motivate new and existing associates 
operating results could be adversely affected if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient economic incentive or interest to retain existing associates and to attract new associates 
the violation of marketing or advertising laws by associates in connection with the sale of our products or the promotion of our compensation plan could adversely affect our business 
new associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to the usana policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit associates from making certain claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products  associates may from time to time  without our knowledge and in violation of our policies  create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims  or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
these violations may result in legal action against us by regulatory agencies or state attorneys general  and private civil actions as well 
legal actions against associates or others associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business  including our network marketing system 
we take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor associate activities to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by associates and to assure that the terms of our compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
publicity resulting from these associate activities can also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain associates and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation  which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to sell some of our products in certain markets 
network marketing systems  such as ours  are frequently subject to laws and regulations directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition  and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than investment in the sponsoring company 
we are subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  our marketing system could be found not to comply with these laws and regulations or may be prohibited 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries  or be forced to alter our compensation plan 
we are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change  which could require us to change or modify the way we conduct business in certain markets 
this could be particularly detrimental to us if we had to change or modify the way we conduct business in markets that represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the united states federal trade commission released a proposed new business opportunity rule on april  the proposed rule would require pre sale disclosures for all business opportunities  which might include network marketing compensation plans 
the new business opportunity rule is currently only a proposed rule 
if implemented at all  the rule ultimately may not be implemented in a form that applies to network marketing compensation plans  or it may change significantly before it is implemented 
if the proposed rule were adopted as currently proposed  it would require usana to change its current practices regarding pre sale disclosures 
we may have or incur obligations relating to the activities of our distributors 
our distributors are subject to taxation  and in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as sales taxes or value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate records 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
in the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees  or if our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors  under existing laws and interpretations  we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations imposed upon employers relating to their employees  including social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
our ability to attract and retain associates and to sustain and enhance sales through our associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry  our competition  or our business generally 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations  regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of key management personnel would adversely affect our business 
our founder  chairman and ceo  dr 
myron wentz  is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our business  and our message is based in large part on the vision and reputation of dr 
wentz  which helps distinguish us from our competitors 
any loss or limitation on dr 
wentz as a lead spokesman for our mission  business and products could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our executive officers  including executive vice presidents  are primarily responsible for our day to day operations  and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers  to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels  and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team 
we cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers  nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our executive officers 
the loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives dr 
wentz effective control and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues 
gull holdings  ltd  an entity that is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owned of our outstanding common stock at december  by virtue of this stock ownership  dr 
wentz is able to exert significant influence over the election of the members of our board of directors and our business affairs 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  dr 
wentz also currently serves as chairman of the board of directors 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to this directorship or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to other shareholders of the company 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation  which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution  and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries 
failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by the fda could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in addition  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action by the ftc could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
on march   the fda announced a proposal for new gmp s specific to dietary supplements 
we were hopeful that the fda would release the final gmp s during  however  this did not take place 
although we are unsure of when these final gmp s will be released  we anticipate that the release will be forthcoming in the near future 
these gmp s  if promulgated  may be significantly more rigorous than currently applicable gmp s 
we believe that we currently manufacture our dietary supplement products according to the standards of the fda s pharmaceutical level gmp s 
if new gmp s are adopted  however  we may be required to expend additional capital and resources on manufacturing controls in the future in order to comply with the law 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
for example  our manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and health canada and is certified by australia s tga 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies of the countries in which our products are sold 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
they could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and reporting  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 
our net sales are significantly affected by our success in growing existing markets  as well as opening new markets 
as we continue to expand into international markets  our business becomes increasingly subject to political  economic  legal and other risks 
changes in these markets could adversely affect our business 
we have a history of expanding into new international markets 
we commenced operations in australia and new zealand in february  in the united kingdom in december  and in hong kong in november in  we began limited business activity in japan and launched more formal operations there in october in october  we began business operations in taiwan 
we ceased in market operations in the united kingdom at the end of the first quarter of we commenced operations in south korea and singapore in july and november  respectively  and opened operations in mexico during march in january  we began business operations in malaysia 
we believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis  or that new markets will be profitable 
we must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  before marketing commences it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
we may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country 
once we have entered a market  we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers 
the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  other network marketing companies already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local associate population to a new opportunity  such as usana  or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified associates 
there can be no assurance that  even if we are able to commence operations in foreign countries  there will be a sufficiently large population of persons inclined to participate in our network marketing system 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our compensation plan across all markets in which our products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
on december   china announced the adoption of new regulations governing direct selling 
single level compensation models are permissible under the new regulations  however  these regulations prohibit multi level compensation models as practiced by usana and many other direct selling companies 
if we were to enter the chinese market we would be required to adjust our compensation and selling model to comply with the specific form of direct selling permissible under the new regulations 
these adjustments could require more time and effort to enter the chinese market than would otherwise be necessary if multi level compensation models were permissible 
additionally  modifying our successful compensation plan and sales model may create uncertainty regarding our expectations for success after entering the market 
an increase in the amount of incentives paid to associates would reduce profitability 
the payment of associate incentives is a significant expense 
these incentives include commissions  leadership bonuses  and certain awards and prizes 
from time to time we have changed our compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales 
management closely monitors the amount of associate incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may adjust our compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
there can be no assurance that these changes or future changes to the compensation plan or product pricing will be successful in maintaining current levels of associate incentives expense as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  these changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated associates 
an increase in incentive payments to associates as a percentage of net sales would reduce our profitability 
we are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems 
our success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability  and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology 
our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain associate and preferred customer records  accurately track purchases and incentive payments  manage accounting  finance and manufacturing operations  generate reports  and provide customer service and technical support 
although off site data back up is maintained  it is possible that an interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of a significant associate or downline organization could adversely affect our business 
we rely on the successful efforts of certain associates 
our compensation plan is designed to permit associates to sponsor new associates  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as downline associates within the sponsoring associate s downline network 
if these downline associates in turn sponsor new associates  additional business centers are created  with the new downline associates becoming part of the original sponsor s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  associates develop business relationships with other associates 
the loss of a key associate or group of associates  large turnovers or decreases in the size of the associate force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction  the costs associated with training new associates  and other related expenses may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  our ability to continue to attract and retain associates can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general business and economic conditions  public perceptions about network marketing programs  high visibility investigations or legal proceeding against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care  or weight management products generally  other competing network marketing organizations entering into the marketplace that may recruit our existing associates or reduce the potential pool of new associates  and changes to usana s compensation plan required by law or implemented for business reasons that cause it to be more difficult to attract and retain associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain associates in numbers sufficient to sustain future growth or to maintain present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier  and more established competitors 
we face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  and other nutritional products as described in greater detail in business competition 
numerous manufacturers  associates  and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition and personal care products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution  including retail stores 
our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other companies 
we are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention  and commitment of new and existing associates 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by direct selling tends to be limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
taxation and transfer pricing considerations affect our operations 
our principal domicile is the united states 
the following table summarizes sales data as a percentage of consolidated net sales and the associated statutory income tax rates for each of our geographic regions sales data for the united states region includes of net consolidated sales contributed by the contract manufacturing segment region net sales tax rate united states canada australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea singapore mexico in many countries  including the united states  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our us and foreign entities and are taxed accordingly 
although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions  we are subject to the risk that taxing authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed 
we are also subject to the risk that taxing authorities in any market we operate could change laws in a manner that may increase our effective tax rate and or duties on our products 
under tax treaties  we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for foreign taxes actually paid abroad 
at this time there are no major audits in progress 
in the event future audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us  we may or may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits 
currently  we are utilizing all foreign tax credits in the year in which they arise 
because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment  we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future 
as a result  adverse outcomes in these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
exchange rate fluctuations affect our foreign operations and could reduce our net sales and earnings 
over the past several years  a significant amount of our net sales have been generated outside the united states 
net sales generated outside the united states for the year ended december  represented of total net sales 
we intend to continue to expand our foreign operations  exposing us to risks of changes in social  political  and economic conditions in foreign countries  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment or foreign exchange restrictions in countries where we have operations 
since a significant portion of our sales is in foreign countries  exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for us to establish or continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell similar products in the same market 
as our business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that our us financial results be converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases by our foreign subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as operations expand in countries where foreign currency transactions may be made  our operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these changes on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect our sales to customers outside the united states 
we enter into forward and option foreign exchange contracts to manage currency fluctuations on certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency contract transactions will protect operating results and cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
those adverse effects would also adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
disruptions to shipping channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets 
in the financial press reported congestion at west coast ports caused by increasing cargo volumes  a lack of capacity on the railroads  and a shortage of manpower 
we felt the effects in our container shipments to australia  which required additional use of airfreight to meet demand 
port congestion has since been relieved 
although subsequently there has been no significant port congestion  we continue to watch for signs of upcoming congestion 
congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs 
our freight forwarders will continue to exercise flexibility in the selection of ports and carriers to provide the best service 
the inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices  or at all  or the inability to obtain certain products from third party suppliers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials 
we acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
normally  materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased on account or by purchase order 
we have very few long term agreements for the supply of these materials 
we also contract with third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products  including gelatin capsuled supplements  garlic ec  optomega  certain powdered drink mixes  and bars 
these third party suppliers and manufacturers produce and  in most cases  package these products according to formulations developed by or in conjunction with our in house product development team 
there is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue manufacturing our products or selling their products to us 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for the products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
in certain situations  we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source 
we have in the past discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials and manufactured products needed by us in the quantities requested or at prices we are willing to pay 
because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials and products  we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions not within our control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
shortages of raw materials used in certain of our products may temporarily adversely affect our margins and our profitability related to the sale of those products 
in the demand for coenzyme q in the nutrition industry began to increase dramatically  which subsequently caused a shortage in supply of this raw material component 
as a result  suppliers began re tooling their manufacturing facilities to increase production capacity in order to meet the growing demand 
certain of our nutritional products were affected by this raw material shortage 
although we identified multiple sources to supply quality raw ingredients  quantities of materials acquired during this shortage were purchased at higher prices  which negatively impacted gross margins for those products affected 
by mid some suppliers had re tooled their manufacturing facilities to increase production capacity of coq  and more competitors entered the market to produce it  which has caused supply to increase and purchase prices to decline 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs  and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although we believe all of our products to be safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
we conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products  but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because we are highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety  and quality of our products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  we could be adversely affected in the event those products should prove or be asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products or a competitor s similar products 
as a manufacturer we may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  we have not been party to any product liability litigation  although certain individuals have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our nutritional products 
these matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance  which we believe to be adequate for our needs  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate 
our business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
most of our products are not protected by patents 
the labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and interactions among various substances 
in this respect  we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer  and more effective formulations of our products 
we protect our investment in research  as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products  by relying on trade secret laws 
we have also entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  we endeavor to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for our products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada  and many of the other countries in which we are either presently operating or plan to commence operations in the future 
notwithstanding our efforts as described above  there can be no assurance that these efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
if an infringement claim is asserted  we may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis  or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our products that are alleged to have infringed 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
there can be no assurance that third party claims will not in the future adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
we manufacture approximately of the products sold to our customers 
as a result  we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities in salt lake city  utah 
those operations are subject to power failures  the breakdown  failure  or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste  and other toxic and hazardous materials 
our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations  and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities  or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the nutritional supplement industry  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have  in certain cases  not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
we may incur liability under our athlete guarantee program  if and to the extent participating athletes make a successful claim against usana for testing positive for certain banned substances while taking usana nutritional supplements 
usana believes that its nutritional supplement products are free from substances that have been banned by world class training and competitive athletic programs 
the company retains independent testing agencies to conduct periodic checks for banned substances 
the company further believes that while its products promote good health  they are not otherwise considered to be performance enhancing as that term has been used in defining substances that are banned from use in international competition by the world anti doping agency wada 
for many years  usana has been a sponsor of olympic athletes and professional competitors around the world 
these athletes have been tested on many occasions and have never tested positive for banned substances as a result of taking usana nutritional products 
to back up its claim that athletes who use the company s products as part of their training regimen will not be consuming banned substances  the company has offered to enter into agreements with select athletes  some of whom are high profile and highly compensated  which state that  during the term of the agreement  should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in the wada  and should such positive result be the result of taking usana nutritional products  usana would compensate that athlete two times their current annual earnings up to one million dollars based on the athlete s personal level of competition  endorsement  and other income  as well as other factors 
to mitigate potential exposure under these agreements  we designate lots identified as dedicated to the program and retain additional samples  store designated lot samples externally with a third party  and establish a chain of custody that requires signatures on behalf of usana and the third party to transfer possession of the product lots and that restricts access by usana employees after the transfer 
all applicants are subject to screening and acceptance by the company in its sole discretion 
contracts are tailored to fit the athlete s individual circumstances and the amount of the company s exposure is limited based on the level of sponsorship of the participating athlete 
although the company believes that the pool of current and potential participants in the program is small  there is no guarantee that an athlete accepted in the program will not successfully make a claim against the guarantee  which would require that the company pay the athlete under the terms of its agreement with that athlete 
the company currently has no insurance to protect it from potential claims under this program

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and manufacture high quality nutritional and personal care products that are distributed through a network marketing system 
net sales are primarily dependent upon the efforts of a network of independent associates who purchase products and sales materials 
we also sell products directly to preferred customers who purchase products for personal use and are not permitted to resell or distribute the products 
as of december   we had  active associates and  active preferred customers worldwide 
for purposes of this report  we only count as active customers those associates and preferred customers who have purchased product from usana at any time during the most recent three month period 
as discussed more fully in note l of the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have two reportable segments direct selling and contract manufacturing 
the direct selling segment constitutes our principal line of business developing  manufacturing  and distributing nutritional and personal care products through a network marketing system 
the contract manufacturing segment consists of manufacturing and packaging the company s sens product line of skin and personal care products as well as contract manufacturing services provided to a limited number of third party customers 
presentation for comparability purposes  the selected consolidated financial data set forth in this report includes a minor reclassification that results in a reduction to both net sales and associate incentives  but does not impact earnings from operations  net earnings  or earnings per share 
this reclassification is discussed further in item of note a to the consolidated financial statements 
sales  and shipping and handling billed to customers  are recorded as revenue when the product is shipped and title passes to the customer  net of applicable sales discounts 
payments received for unshipped products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities 
a provision for product returns and allowances is provided for and is founded on historical experience 
additionally  the company collects an annual renewal fee from associates that is deferred on receipt and recognized as income on a straight line basis over a twelve month period 
cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance  and overhead costs that are directly associated with the production and distribution of products and sales materials  as well as duties and taxes associated with product exports 
as international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales could increase slightly  reflecting additional duties  freight  and other expenses associated with international growth 
associate incentive expenses are incurred only by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant expense for this segment at of net segment sales in associate incentives include commissions and leadership bonuses that are paid weekly  based on sales volume points 
compensation paid to our associates for promotions and contests are also reported as a component of associate incentives 
products are assigned a sales volume point value that is independent of the product s price 
associates earn commissions based on sales volume points generated in their downline sales organization 
products such as our starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value  and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items 
although insignificant  an associate may earn commissions on sales volume points generated from personal purchases that are not considered to be part of their qualifying purchases 
qualifying purchases are the amount of product that associates must purchase each month  which they must either resell to consumers or personally use  in order to be qualified to earn commissions or bonuses under usana s compensation plan 
commission paid to an associate on their own personal purchases are considered a sales discount and reported as a reduction to net sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  associate events  promotions and advertising  and professional fees along with other marketing and administrative expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of continued investments in computer and telecommunications equipment and systems to support international expansion 
we anticipate that significant additional capital investments will be required in future periods to promote and support anticipated growth in sales and the increasing size of our active customer base 
research and development expenses include costs incurred in developing new products  enhancing existing products  and formulating products for introduction into international markets 
results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales  respectively  for the periods indicated fiscal year consolidated statements of earnings data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses associate incentives selling  general  and administrative research and development total operating expenses earnings from operations other income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings summary of financial results and developments consolidated net sales continued to improve throughout  increasing to million from million in excluding the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations  net sales increased 
overall  sales growth can be attributed to an increase in the number of active associates resulting in increased product sold in most countries within the direct selling segment 
net earnings for the year increased to million 
as a percentage of net sales  net earnings decreased from in  to in two items that significantly influenced these changes in net earnings for the year were increased net sales  and the recognition of equity based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment equity based compensation expense was not recognized in prior years consolidated statements of earnings  which is discussed further below 
the first significant event of the year was our inaugural asia pacific convention held in singapore in march 
in september we held our annual international convention in salt lake city  utah 
nearly  associates from different countries attended the september convention 
at our international convention  we introduced a new optimizer supplement  tenx antioxidant blast  a unique dietary supplement fruit bar that provides the equivalent of two fruit servings and is fortified with important antioxidants  including quercetin and our patented olivol olive fruit extract 
we also announced that we would be featured in the november issue of success from home magazine  a commercial publication on home based business opportunities 
we purchased large quantities of the november issue of this magazine and priced them for sale to our associates at cost 
in an effort to further subsidize the cost to associates of distributing the magazine as a prospecting and marketing tool  we also offer free shipping on packs of magazines when placed the monthly product subscription program known as autoship 
in addition  and for a limited time  associates who purchased a pack of the success from home magazine were eligible to participate in a matching commission check promotion 
in september we also received our business license in malaysia and announced that we expected to begin operations there in the first quarter of we officially commenced operations in malaysia on january  throughout we will continue to focus on growing our business in existing markets  as well as developing our business in malaysia 
implementation of sfas no 
r effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  which requires equity based compensation expense to be recognized in financial statements 
the modified prospective application was used to adopt these provisions 
under this method  compensation expense includes the estimated fair value of equity awards earned during the reported period 
our consolidated statements of earnings for interim periods reflect equity based compensation expense  which has not been reflected in either interim or annual consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal years prior to equity based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended december  was as follows year ended december  in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative research and development related tax benefit net equity based compensation expense earnings per basic and diluted share were reduced from what earnings would have been exclusive of equity based compensation 
the following table shows remaining unrecognized compensation expense on a pre tax basis related to all types of equity awards outstanding as of december  this table does not include an estimate for future grants that may be issued 
in thousands thereafter the cost above is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

net sales in the asia pacific region of the direct selling segment improved over prior year results 
excluding the negative impact of foreign currency in this region  sales increased 
this sales growth was driven by a increase in the number of active associates 
we believe that in addition to our quality products and rewarding compensation plan  the growth in the number of active associates can be attributed to the following unique incentive programs  including contests and promotions designed to increase selling activity  ongoing communication with associate leaders in the field  growing associate leadership base  company sponsored events directed at associate recognition  motivation  and training  and the introduction of new products and sales tools 
net sales in the contract manufacturing segment increased to million  from million in the increase can be attributed primarily to the fulfillment of backlogged orders throughout the first half of the year and  to a lesser extent  a modest increase in sales to existing third party customers 
the company follows the practice of providing guidance concerning anticipated consolidated net sales 
management currently anticipates net sales for to grow between and  compared with the anticipated increase in net sales is expected to come from our direct selling segment

consolidated gross profit improved to of net sales in  from in this increase was driven by modest improvements in both of our operating segments that are explained below 
gross profit in the direct selling segment improved to of net segment sales in  from in this improvement in gross profit margins for the direct selling segment can be attributed primarily to lower costs on certain key raw materials  such as coenzyme q this improvement was partially offset by the following higher freight costs on shipments to associates and preferred customers  the required inclusion of equity based compensation expense  and additional costs relating to our promotions on the success from home magazine 
although gross profit margin in the contract manufacturing segment improved modestly  this segment continued to generate minimal gross profit margins from its third party customers in both and as a reminder  we acquired the contract manufacturing business primarily as a means to produce the company s sens product line 
we are not actively pursuing growth of the third party business in this segment 
we anticipate improvement to gross profit margins in the direct selling segment during  which is primarily due to the lower costs negotiated on raw materials 
additionally  we replaced one of our freight carriers  which we believe will provide some relief to the higher shipping costs that we experienced during associate incentives 
expenses related to associate incentives are only incurred by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant cost as a percentage of net sales for this segment 
associate incentives increased to of net segment sales in  compared to in the increase in associate incentives relative to net segment sales can be primarily attributed to an increase in amounts paid on incentive promotions  including higher paying contests and promotions 
we expect associate incentives to approximate current levels for the foreseeable future 
however  as we look for ways to continue to increase sales  our associate incentives may fluctuate modestly quarter to quarter 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from in this increase  as a percentage of net sales  can be attributed largely to the recognition of equity based compensation expense  the selling  general and administrative portion of which totaled of net sales in this increased cost as a percentage of sales was partially offset by modest operating leverage generated on our growing sales base 
in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from to this absolute increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can  in great part  be attributed to the following increased spending in many of our markets to support growing sales and an increasing number of associates  expensing of equity based compensation of million  increased spending related to our international expansion efforts  mostly in malaysia  and increased costs associated with company sponsored events such as our annual international convention held in september  and the inaugural asia pacific convention held in march we believe that selling  general  and administrative expenses in  as a percentage of net sales  will be in line with what we experienced in although we have experienced leverage on this line item in the last several years  we will be focusing on a few key initiatives in that we believe will have a beneficial impact to the long term financial health of usana 
other income 
other income increased to million in  from thousand in the improvement in other income can be attributed to foreign currency gains realized in income taxes 
income taxes totaled of earnings before income taxes in  compared with in this increase reduced diluted earnings per share in by approximately 
this increase can be attributed to a phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion in  tax expense associated with non deductible value added taxes  and taxes associated with equity based compensation under sfas no 
r 
the effective tax rate increase was partially offset by an increase in the federal incremental research credit 
we expect that our effective tax rate for the full year of will be approximately 
this expected increase is due to the complete phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion  partially offset by the increased deduction for qualified production activities as well as an extension of the federal incremental research credit 
the anticipated tax rate for may be affected by the type and amount of stock options exercised during the year and other items 
net earnings 
net earnings increased to million in  an increase of million  from million in net earnings growth slowed during due to the following the inclusion of equity based compensation expense that impacted net earnings by million  higher relative incentives paid to our associates  increased expenses associated with international expansion efforts  and a higher effective tax rate 
diluted earnings per share improved to in  an increase of  from in diluted earnings per share in included equity based compensation expense that reduced earnings per share by  whereas the diluted earnings per share of in did not include equity based compensation expense 
we expect to grow earnings per share in between and 
this estimate assumes a tax rate of  which is meaningfully higher than the tax rate we experienced in we believe that growth in earnings per share will exceed that of growth in net sales as a result of improved gross margins  a lower proportion of our net sales coming from the contract manufacturing segment  and execution of the remaining amounts available under the share buy back program

the decrease in net sales of our contract manufacturing segment can be attributed to an increased focus on the manufacture of our sens line and a decreased emphasis on our third party business

consolidated gross profit increased to of net sales in from in this improvement in consolidated gross profit can primarily be attributed to a decrease in the impact that the contract manufacturing segment had on the total  and to a lesser extent  modest leverage benefits gained on a rising sales base 
gross profit in the direct selling segment increased modestly in to of net segment sales  compared to in this modest improvement can primarily be attributed to leverage benefits on semi variable costs realized on a rising sales base 
the contract manufacturing segment generated minimal profit from its third party customers for the year  compared to gross profit of in the decline in gross profit margin from third party customers can primarily be attributed to production inefficiencies in the segment s third party business 
the contract manufacturing business was acquired primarily as a means to produce the company s sens product line  not for the third party business 
associate incentives 
expenses related to associate incentives are only incurred by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant cost as a percentage of net sales for this segment 
associate incentives increased to of net segment sales in  compared to in the increase in associate incentives relative to net segment sales can be attributed to a higher payout rate of base commissions generated 
we also began an initiative to increase rewards to our top performing associates in the third quarter of through contests  promotions  and other incentives designed to support sales growth and assist our associates in growing their respective businesses 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease  as a percentage of net sales  can be attributed to leverage gained on the increase in sales during in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from to  which was attributable to an increase in spending in many of our markets to support growing sales and an increasing number of associates 
income taxes 
income taxes totaled of earnings before income taxes in  compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate for can be attributed to the first phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion  which was only partially offset by a new deduction for qualified production activities

because our products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we are highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality  and efficacy of our products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more products or other products similar to our products could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  quarterly revenues  expenses  and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues in future periods or be able to sustain the level of revenue or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis that we have sustained in the past 
due to the foregoing factors  future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurred  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources we continue to finance our growth with cash flows from operations 
in  net cash flows from operating activities totaled million  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at december  net working capital increased to million at december   compared with net working capital of million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and net working capital during can be attributed to strong cash flow from operating activities  which was offset in great part by the purchase of shares under our share repurchase plan totaling million 
we have continued to grow significantly over the last several years and require additional administrative and warehouse space  as well as additional parking for our employees 
to address this need  we are expanding our corporate headquarters and anticipate that the facility expansion will require a total investment of approximately million  which is meaningfully higher than the original estimate we provided of million in our form k 
this increase is due to an increase in the scope of this expansion  as well as an increase in the cost of materials 
as of december   progress billings on this expansion totaled million  of which million was paid and million was accrued for work performed through december  we expect the remaining amounts to be paid in full during during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to purchase a facility in australia  which will replace the facility we currently lease there 
we expect to move operations to this new facility in late or early  and we will terminate our existing lease at that time 
we placed a deposit on this facility of thousand during the fourth quarter of  and paid the remaining amount of million in january when we assumed possession of this facility 
we expect to spend an additional million on the remodel and fit out of this facility during we believe that the future investments in our corporate headquarters  as well as the new facility in australia  will be paid for with cash flows generated from operations 
total investments in property  plant  and equipment in are expected to be between and million  including the aforementioned facilities 
during the fiscal year ended december   directors  officers  and employees exercised stock options  resulting in cash proceeds to the company of million 
during the second quarter of  our million credit facility was amended  increasing our line of credit to million 
the amendment also modified certain restrictive covenants in the agreement to be based on ebitda and a debt coverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe that current cash balances  cash provided by operations  and amounts available under the line of credit are sufficient to cover our capital needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future 
if we experience an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
we might also require or seek additional financing for the purpose of expanding new markets  growing our existing markets  and for other reasons 
such financing may include the sale of additional equity securities 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to existing shareholders 
contractual obligations and commercial contingencies the following table summarizes our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital commitments other commitments total contractual obligations obligations for operating leases in the above table contain the assumption that  in the normal course of business  any facility leases that expire within the time frame represented will be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties  assuming operations continue and will extend  at a maximum  through included in capital commitments in the above table is the remaining million for the expansion to our corporate headquarters building 
we expect this construction to be complete by the end of  at an estimated total cost of approximately million 
also included in capital commitments is the remaining million due upon possession of the australian facility 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
those estimates and assumptions are derived and continually evaluated based on historical experiences  current facts and circumstances  and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may sometimes differ materially from estimates under different conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and those that require management s most subjective judgments 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates are as described in this section 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized at the point of shipment of the merchandise  at which point the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
sab specifies that revenue is realizable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
for our direct selling segment  we require cash or credit card payment prior to shipping and do not extend credit to customers 
payments received for unshipped products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities 
a provision for product returns and allowances is provided for and is founded on historical experience 
in addition  emerging issues task force no  accounting of shipping and handling fees and costs  states amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as revenue 
in accordance with the guidelines of emerging issues task force no  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  commissions paid to a purchasing associate on his or her own orders will be captured and reported as a reduction to net sales in the form of sales discounts 
management estimates  based on the structure of usana s compensation plan  that an associate who places an order with sales volume points in a personal sales position will eventually be paid commission on that purchase 
reduction of revenue for personal sales positions for associates outside of the united states is converted to us dollars at the average exchange rate for the period 
application of eitf for commission paid on an associate s own orders resulted in reductions to previously reported net sales by and during and  respectively 
in addition  reported net sales were lower than what would have been otherwise reported had this change not been implemented 
also  we collect an annual renewal fee from our associates that is deferred when collected and recognized as income on a straight line basis over a subsequent twelve month period 
allowance for inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor  and overhead 
an allowance for inventory valuation is maintained and is based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
to estimate the allowance  various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning  and market conditions 
a change in any of these variables could result in additional reserves 
valuation of goodwill and impairment analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair market value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  however  it is tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
we engage an independent third party to conduct the annual impairment test of goodwill 
we determine the fair market value of reporting units acquired using widely accepted valuation methods  including both a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach involves judgment when considering the appropriateness of comparable entities and use of related multiples to determine fair market value  in terms of operating activities  size  and scope 
the income approach requires the use of estimates and assumptions in projecting future operating results and related cash flows 
based on the valuation conducted as part of the impairment test  if a significant downward revision were made in estimates and assumptions that resulted in a fair market value for the reporting unit that was less than its carrying value  an impairment loss for goodwill would be necessary to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity 
there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the acquired subsidiaries for the year ended december  accounting for income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences for items treated differently for tax and financial reporting 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this estimation process periodically results in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on technical merits of the provision 
fin also provides guidance on the measurement  classification and disclosure of tax return positions in the financial statements 
fin is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption 
the company s accounting for income tax contingency reserves is not based on the provisions of fin because its financial statements for the year ended december  have been issued without the early adoption of the provisions of this interpretation 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our foreign operations 
net sales  earnings from operations  and net earnings are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political  and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
foreign currency risks 
consolidated net sales outside the united states represented   and of net sales in   and  respectively 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  with all revenue and expenses being translated at weighted average exchange rates for reported periods 
in general  our reported sales and earnings are affected positively by a weakening us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
we seek to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our strategy in this regard includes entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage currency fluctuations in our expected net cash flow from certain of our international markets  which are primarily represented by intercompany cash transfers 
as of december   we had contracts in place to offset exposure to the canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  new taiwan dollar  and mexican peso 
for additional disclosure regarding outstanding foreign currency forwards and options  see note j of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
there can be no assurance that our practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks encountered in connection with our foreign currency transactions 
following are the average exchange rates of foreign currency units to one us dollar for each of our foreign markets for fiscal years   and year ended canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar hong kong dollar japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won singapore dollar mexican peso chinese yuan the mexican peso exchange rate represents the average for the first ten months of mexican operations that commenced in march the chinese yuan exchange rate represents the average for the first three months of operations of our chinese manufacturing facility acquired in october market was not in operation during year indicated 
interest rate risks 
as of december   we had no outstanding debt  and  therefore  we currently have no direct exposure to interest rate risk
