item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company  whose primary focus is on biopharmaceutical product development 
since inception in june our efforts have been principally devoted to research and development  securing patent protection  obtaining corporate relationships and raising capital 
since inception through december   we have sustained net losses of  our losses have resulted primarily from expenditures in connection with our clinical development of licensed products  the purchase of in process research and development  stock based compensation expense  patent filing and maintenance  outside accounting and legal services and regulatory consulting fees 
from inception through december  we have not generated any revenue from operations 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop our product candidates  expand our clinical development team and prepare for the commercial launch of our product candidates 
we do not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products  and do not expect to have such for several years  if at all 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with clinical development team salaries and staff costs  application and filing for regulatory approval of our proposed products  regulatory and scientific consulting fees  clinical and patient costs for product candidates in on going trials  sponsored pre clinical research  royalty payments as well as legal and professional fees associated with filing and maintaining our patent and license rights to our proposed products 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as we develop our product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and related costs  rent and professional accounting and corporate legal fees 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly over the next few years as we continue to build our operations to support our product candidates and as we incur costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
history in march  callisto pharmaceuticals  inc old callisto  a non public company  purchased of the outstanding common shares of webtronics  inc  a public company webtronics  for  webtronics was incorporated in florida on february  and had limited operations during the year ended december  on april   pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated march   as amended april   synergy acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of webtronics merged into synergy pharmaceuticals inc synergy and callisto acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of webtronics merged into old callisto collectively  the merger 
as a result of the merger  old callisto and synergy became wholly owned subsidiaries of webtronics 
old callisto changed its name to callisto research labs  llc and webtronics changed its name to callisto pharmaceuticals  inc and changed its state of incorporation from florida to delaware 
plan of operations our plan of operations for the next twelve months is to focus primarily on the clinical development of our two drugs  atiprimod and l annamycin  to treat neuroendocrine carcinomas including advanced carcinoid cancer  adult and pediatric acute leukemia a disease of the white blood cells and multiple myeloma an incurable blood cancer that invades and proliferates in bone marrow 
our lead drug candidate  atiprimod  is an orally administered drug with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity 
we are presently enrolling patients in two clinical trials in low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine cancer and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma at a number of clinical sites in the us on november   we announced the initiation of a multi center open label phase ii clinical trial of atiprimod in low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine cancers  including advanced carcinoid cancer patients 
this trial is based on earlier encouraging clinical results from an ongoing trial of atiprimod in advanced cancer patients that showed stable disease and disease related symptom relief in patients with advanced carcinoid cancer 
atiprimod is also in a multi center  dose escalation phase i iia clinical trial in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients 
in december  we announced interim results from this trial on patients treated with atiprimod  including patients at the highest dose level of mg day 
two patients exhibited stable disease  with one patient having a decrease in m protein measure of tumor burden over months of treatment 
in  we amended the protocol to continue the trial at higher dose levels and currently have this trial underway at clinical sites in the us our second lead drug candidate  l annamycin  earlier completed an initial phase i iia clinical trial in relapsed or refractory leukemia patients with a prior sponsor 
l annamycin is a novel compound from the anthracycline family of proven anti cancer drugs  which has a novel therapeutic profile  including activity against drug resistant tumors and significantly reduced cardiotoxicity  or damage to the heart 
l annamycin was in licensed by callisto in october  and is presently in two clinical trials a phase i iia clinical trial in adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia all patients at three clinical sites in the us  and a phase i clinical trial in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory all or aml 
atiprimod to treat advanced carcinoid cancer patients and multiple myeloma on august   our wholly owned subsidiary  synergy  entered into a worldwide license agreement with anormed inc anormed  a canadian corporation  to research  develop  sell and commercially exploit the atiprimod skf patent rights 
atiprimod is one of a class of compounds known as azaspiranes and was originally developed as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis based on encouraging data from a number of animal models of arthritis and autoimmune indications 
the development of this drug originated with a partnership between anormed and smithkline beecham skb that led to the successful filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  and completion of three phase i clinical trials involving a total of patients 
the drug successfully completed both single and multiple dose phase i clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
both trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics how the body takes up and eliminates drugs of atiprimod and showed that the drug is well tolerated 
in the third phase i clinical trial  the drug was found to be well tolerated in an open label extension study performed with patients from the first two studies  with patients on the drug for as long as one year 
preclinical studies atiprimod s specific ability to lower the level of key growth factors  known to play an important role in the development of multiple myeloma  is the basis for its potential use as a drug to treat this disease 
atiprimod was previously shown to inhibit the production of the pro inflammatory mediators il and tnf alpha in a number of animal models of inflammation and autoimmune disease 
atiprimod was also demonstrated using in vitro models of tumor cell growth to inhibit proliferation of a number of human multiple myeloma cell lines 
characterization of the mechanism of atiprimod s antiproliferative activity in a series of experiments showed that the drug works by inducing apoptosis programmed cell death in myeloma cells 
in a second series of experiments performed with atiprimod on co cultures composed of multiple myeloma cells plus bone marrow stromal cells used to simulate the human disease  the drug was found to have a profound effect on secretion of the angiogenic blood vessel related growth factor vegf 
a separate set of experiments also suggest an additional explanation for the disease modifying activity of atiprimod originally observed in chemically induced arthritic rat animal studies  and provide a further rationale for the application of this drug to treat multiple myeloma 
using a bone resorption assay bone degradation experiment to measure the effect of drug on osteoclast mediated bone resorption  atiprimod demonstrated a profound effect on osteoclast  or white blood cell  function 
the drug appears to be selectively toxic for activated osteoclasts  displaying a negligible effect on bone marrow stromal cells 
completed clinical studies atiprimod successfully completed single and multiple dose phase i clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra 
in the initial phase i study  patients were given single escalating doses of drug mg kg  with a month follow up 
atiprimod was well tolerated  displaying no clinically relevant changes in any laboratory parameters 
in particular  liver function tests remained in the normal range 
the second phase i study involved a day multiple dose rising study in ra patients 
the study evaluated the effect of food on bioavailability  or the concentration of drug in the body  as well as the safety and pharmacokinetics of repeat dosing 
dosages included    and mg day plus a day cohort at mg day  with month follow up 
all doses were well tolerated and clinical tests were unremarkable 
significantly  reductions in tender and swollen joint counts were noted in a number of subjects during the course of the dosing period 
individuals from the two phase i safety studies were also involved in a phase i open label extension trial at mg day dosage 
forty three patients entered the study and remained on the drug as long as months 
clinical laboratory results for all patients were unremarkable  in particular liver enzyme levels remained within the normal range in all patients throughout the study period 
development strategy atiprimod commenced a phase i iia clinical trial in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients on may  these are patients that have a re occurrence of active disease  and no longer respond to approved therapies 
the phase i iia clinical trial is an open label study  with the primary objective of assessing safety of drug and identifying the maximum tolerated dose 
the secondary objectives are to measure the pharmacokinetics  evaluate the response in patients with refractory disease and to identify possible surrogate responses to the drug to better determine the mechanism of drug action 
in december  we announced interim results from this trial performed in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients which consisted of patients treated with atiprimod  including patients at the highest dose level of mg day 
two patients exhibited stable disease  with one patient having a decrease in m protein measure of tumor burden over months of treatment 
it was also noted that two patients reported a subjective decrease in bone pain 
in  we amended the protocol to continue the trial at higher dose levels and currently have this trial open at clinical sites in the us on march   we announced a second phase i iia clinical trial of atiprimod in advanced cancer patients 
the trial is entitled an open label study of the safety and efficacy of atiprimod treatment for patients with advanced cancer 
the primary objective is to assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of atiprimod in advanced cancer patients 
the secondary objectives are to measure the pharmacokinetics of atiprimod and evaluate the response in a variety of relapsed solid tumors and hematological malignancies 
this study was conducted at the university of texas md anderson cancer center  and was closed to enrollment in november  on november   we announced the initiation of a multi center  open label phase ii clinical trial of atiprimod in low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinomas  including advanced carcinoid cancer patients 
this trial is based on encouraging clinical results from the phase i clinical trial in advanced cancer patients that showed stable disease and a reduction in disease related symptoms in patients with advanced carcinoid cancer 
the first study site to enter the trial was the hematology oncology services of arkansas in little rock  arkansas 
on january  we announced the opening of a second site for this trial the dana farber cancer institute in boston  ma 
subjects will also be seen at the following facilities brigham and women s hospital  massachusetts general hospital and beth israel deaconess medical center 
on march  we announced the opening of the third site for this trial the physician offices at mount sinai medical center  ny the primary objective of the phase ii clinical trial is to evaluate efficacy of atiprimod in patients with low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma who have metastatic or unresectable cancer and who have either symptoms  despite standard therapy octreotide  or progression of neuroendocrine tumors 
patients  after signing an informed consent  are required to complete two weeks of a symptoms diary to establish their symptoms baseline before commencing atiprimod dosing 
a maximum of evaluable patients will be enrolled in this trial 
efficacy evaluations will include the measure of target lesions per recist  and the quantization of symptom relief 
manufacturing of atiprimod a practical  efficient and cost effective method for producing atiprimod on a commercial scale was originally developed by skb 
in the course of this work  a new dimaleate salt form was developed 
a portion of the kilos of atiprimod drug substance  available from skb  was used as the source for generating the atiprimod dimaleate drug product presently being used in the phase i iia clinical study 
several lots of drug substance were re qualified to meet current fda approved release specifications 
the full package of fully validated analytical methods developed by skb was transferred to a contract research organization used by us to perform all analytical tests 
one large scale gmp production run of atiprimod dimaleate led to the successful release of kg of material available for future phase ii clinical studies 
we plan to enter into a supply contract for atiprimod with a commercial supplier by the end of or after confirming activity of the drug candidate in our current human clinical trials 
l annamycin to treat relapsed acute leukemia on august  we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with the university of texas md anderson cancer center to develop and commercially exploit the l annamycin patent rights 
l annamycin  an anthracycline drug for leukemia therapy  has a novel therapeutic profile  including activity against drug resistant tumors and significantly reduced toxicity 
preclinical studies nonclinical studies have shown that annamycin delivered as a liposomal preparation l annamycin is effective against several different in vivo tumor models animal experiments  including human tumors which are resistant to other chemotherapy drugs  grafted into animals 
additionally  results from in vitro studies cell culture experiments indicate that l annamycin and free annamycin were able to partially overcome tumor resistance to chemotherapy drugs in several tumor cell lines that were resistant to other drugs such as doxorubicin 
in nonclinical toxicity studies  myelosuppression suppression of the body s immune response was noted in mice at a single intravenous dose of mg kg l annamycin 
with weekly intravenous doses of mg kg l annamycin for weeks  or and mg kg l annamycin for weeks in mice  the cardiotoxicity toxicity to heart tissue of l annamycin was substantially less than an equivalent dose of doxorubicin 
in dogs  a single minute intravenous infusion of up to mg kg l annamycin was well tolerated  with no clinically significant adverse effects  hematological or chemical changes  or pathological changes 
completed clinical studies l annamycin was evaluated previously by aronex pharmaceuticals  inc in clinical trials a phase i clinical trial in patients with relapsed solid tumors  a phase ii clinical trial in patients with doxorubicin resistant breast cancer  and a phase i iia trial in patients with relapsed refractory aml and all 
in the initial phase i study  l annamycin was administered by a single to h intravenous infusion at week intervals 
thirty six patients with relapsed solid tumors were treated and treatment courses were administered at doses ranging from to mg m no cardiotoxicity was seen on biopsy of heart tissue of four patients studied 
the maximum tolerated dose mtd for l annamycin in solid tumor patients was found to be mg m a second phase ii study of l annamycin was performed in women with doxorubicin resistant breast cancer 
the median number of prior chemotherapy regimes was two  and six patients had two or more organ sites of involvement 
l annamycin was administered at mg m as a single iv infusion over h every weeks 
of the patients  had clear deterioration and new tumor growth after one or two courses 
the potential of a less cardiotoxic drug that was active against multi drug resistant tumors led to a third trial in relapsed leukemia patients both aml and all 
the trial involved patients with relapsed refractory aml n or all n 
the conclusions drawn from the trial were that l annamycin was safe  well tolerated and showed potential clinical activity in patients with acute leukemias  and that further evaluation of this novel anthracycline in patients with hematopoietic  or blood borne  malignancies was clearly warranted 
development strategy we began a phase i clinical trial at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia all patients on december  additional sites enrolled in this study include the roswell park cancer institute buffalo  ny and the montefiore medical center new york  ny 
the single arm  open label l annamycin trial is designed to enroll patients in a dose escalation phase i portion followed by patients at a final fixed dose in the phase ii portion once the maximum tolerated dose mtd is determined 
up to adult patients can be treated in this single arm trial 
on february   we announced the opening of a phase i clinical trial of l annamycin in pediatric relapsed or refractory all or aml patients 
the trial is presently open at two sites in the us  phoenix children s hospital  phoenix  az  and the university of arizona  tucson  az 
manufacturing of annamycin an improved manufacturing method for annamycin has been developed at antibioticos spa  our commercial supplier of gmp good manufacturing practice drug substance 
gmp material is currently being produced in sufficient quantity for all three anticipated trials outlined in the development strategy section 
the analytical methods developed previously have been successfully transferred  and are in the process of being validated by quantitative technologies  inc  our analytical contract research organization  or cro  for annamycin development work 
the final lyophilized gmp formulated drug product is being manufactured by pharmaceutical services  inc  who previously produced final product for the earlier clinical trials 
currently  antibioticos spa is our sole supplier of annamycin for our clinical trials 
our agreement with antibioticos provides that antibioticos will provide grams of gmp drug substance annamycin for our l annamycin clinical trials 
upon the conclusion of our phase iib clinical trials  the agreement provides that the parties will negotiate in good faith towards a commercial supply agreement for annamycin 
orphan drug status of atiprimod and l annamycin on january   we announced that the office of orphan products development of the fda granted orphan drug designation to atiprimod for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
on september   we announced that the office of orphan products development of the fda granted orphan drug designation to atiprimod for the treatment of carcinoid tumors 
on june   we announced that the office of orphan products development of the fda granted orphan drug designation to l annamycin for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
on june   we announced that the office of orphan products development of the fda granted orphan drug designation to l annamycin for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia 
the fda grants orphan drug status for drug candidates that are intended to treat rare life threatening diseases that  at the time of application  affect no more than  patients in the united states 
the drug must have the ability to provide significant patient benefit over currently available treatment or fill an unmet medical need 
orphan drug designation entitles us to seven years of market exclusivity in the united states of america  and ten years of market exclusivity in europe  upon fda marketing approval  provided that we continue to meet certain conditions established by the fda 
once the fda grants marketing approval of a new drug  the fda will not accept or approve other applications to market the same medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication 
other incentives provided by orphan status include certain tax benefits  eligibility for research grants and protocol assistance 
protocol assistance includes regulatory assistance and possible exemptions or reductions of certain regulatory fees 
guanylate cyclase receptor agonist technology guanilib our guanylate cyclase receptor agonist gcra program is based on control of cyclic guanosine monophosphate cyclic gmp  an important second messenger involved in key cellular processes  which are essential for maintenance of the balance between proliferation and cellular death apoptosis 
uroguanylin  a hormone produced by and secreted by specialized cells in the human gi tract  helps to maintain this balance by activating synthesis of cyclic gmp through activation of guanylate cyclase receptor 
recent findings suggest a role of cyclic gmp in gastrointestinal gi inflammatory diseases 
we have successfully developed a potent analog synthetic molecule of uroguanylin called guanilib formerly called sp 
guanilib has been demonstrated to be superior to uroguanylin in its biological activity  protease stability and ph characteristics 
guanilib is currently undergoing pre clinical animal studies as a treatment for gastrointestinal or gi inflammation in a collaborative study involving clinical gastroenterologist dr 
scott plevy of the university of north carolina  chapel hill  nc 
recent results from his laboratory showed that guanilib was efficacious in treatment of ulcerative colitis in mice 
a patent allowance covering therapeutic applications of guanilib in colon cancer and gi inflammatory diseases has recently been granted by the us patent and trademark office 
degrasyns on january   we entered into a license agreement with the university of texas md anderson cancer center whereby we were granted the exclusive right to manufacture  have manufactured  use  import  offer to sell and or sell anti cancer compounds called tyrphostins renamed degrasyns 
degrasyns are a second generation class of tyrphostins developed by scientists at the university of texas md anderson cancer center that have a novel anti cancer mechanism of action that centers on their ability to selectively degrade key proteins that are involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival 
we plan to work closely with scientists at the university of texas md anderson cancer center during to bring forward a pre clinical candidate for development in the clinic 
superantigen based bioterorrism defense on august   we entered into a license agreement to research  develop  sell and commercially exploit certain rockefeller university rockefeller licensed patents covering peptides and antibodies useful in treating toxic shock syndrome and septic shock 
in addition  on july   we entered into a license agreement for two additional patents related to the regulation of exoproteins in staphylococcus aureus 
on april  we were awarded a two year  biodefense partnership grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to develop a monoclonal antibody and vaccine against bacterial superantigen toxins 
the goal was to design a monoclonal antibody and vaccine that prevent the unregulated activation of t cells human white blood cells by bacteria from the class of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes 
funding for this program will end in the spring of because the bioterrorism program is not a core activity of callisto  we expect to terminate further development work upon the expiration of the research grant 
employees our plan is to use contract research organizations cro for most of our development efforts  including monitoring of clinical trial results  thus minimizing the need to hire full time employees 
as of march   we had full time and part time employees 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we rely heavily on incentive compensation in the form of stock options to recruit  retain and motivate directors  executive officers  employees and consultants 
incentive compensation in the form of stock options is designed to provide long term incentives  develop and maintain an ownership stake and conserve cash during our development stage 
since inception through december  stock based compensation expense has totaled  or of our total accumulated deficit of  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the expense is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  and accordingly we adopted sfas r on january  sfas r provides for two transition methods 
the modified prospective method requires that share based compensation expense be recorded for any employee options granted after the adoption date and for the unvested portion of any employee options outstanding as of the adoption date 
the modified retrospective method requires that  beginning in the first quarter of  all prior periods presented be restated to reflect the impact of share based compensation expense consistent with the proforma disclosures previously required under sfas we have elected to use the modified prospective method in adopting this standard 
prior to january   we had adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as provided for by sfas  we had elected to continue to account for stock based compensation according to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
accordingly  compensation expense had been recognized to the extent of employee services rendered based on the intrinsic value of stock options granted under the plan 
sfas r did not change the way we account for non employee stock based compensation 
we continue to account for shares of common stock  stock options and warrants issued to non employees based on the fair value of the stock  stock option or warrant 
for all fair value computations required for employee and non employee stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires assumptions for expected stock price volatility  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield at the grant date 
our stock price fluctuated from per share as of december  to per share as of december  research and development we do not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products  and do not expect to have such for several years  if at all and therefore our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these include expenditures in connection with an in house research and development laboratory  salaries and staff costs  application and filing for regulatory approval of our proposed products  purchase of in process research and development  regulatory and scientific consulting fees  contract research and royalty payments to outside suppliers  facilities and universities as well as legal and professional fees associated with filing and maintaining our patent and license rights to our proposed products 
while certain of our research and development costs may have future benefits  our policy of expensing all research and development expenditures is predicated on the fact that we have no history of successful commercialization of biopharmaceutical products to base any estimate of the number of future periods that would be benefited 
results of operations years ended december  and december  we had no revenues during the twelve months ended december  and because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products and we do not expect to have such products for several years  if at all 
research and development expenses decreased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the single most significant factor contributing to this decrease in research and development expense was our l annamycin project where our program expenses decreased to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  program expenses  incurred with outside contract research organizations cros  include hospital patient costs  blood testing  drug formulation  synthesis  tableting  data collection  clinical monitoring and fda consultants 
this decreased level of expenditure during the twelve months ended december  compared to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  during which period we purchased and expensed a supply of drug substance which was used in our annamycin clinical trials 
atiprimod clinical program expenses decreased to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  partially offsetting this decrease in l annamycin and atiprimod program expenses were higher expenditures for two of our pre clinical drug candidates  degrasyns and guanilib  increasing to approximately  during the twelve months ended december   as compared to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  research and development in house overhead  not allocated to specific clinical programs  totaled approximately  during the twelve months ended december   a decrease of approximately  or  in line with our overall decrease in program expenses 
partially offsetting these decreases in the above cash based expenditures was higher stock based compensation expense associated with grants to research and development employees 
during the twelve months ended december  and stock based compensation expense totaled  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas r on january  see critical accounting policies above 
on april  we received an  biodefense partnership grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to develop a monoclonal antibody and vaccine against bacterial superantigen toxins over the next two years 
government grant funding under our niaid grant for the twelve months ended december  and was  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  this increase was entirely due to higher cash based general and administrative expenses partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
cash based general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  primarily due to approximately  of increased investor relations costs and  in higher bonuses  partially offset by lower sarbanes oxley compliance testing services  as a result of regulatory extensions during stock based compensation expense  attributable to general and administrative employees  decreased approximately  or  to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  stock based compensation attributable to non employees recorded during the twelve months ended december  totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  this increase of  or was primarily attributable to the expense associated with  warrants we issued to certain investor relations consultants 
the warrants vested on the date of issuance and the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes methodology was  other expense for the twelve months ended december  of  was entirely attributable to liquidated damages incurred for not having filed a registration statement covering our february and april private placements of common stock in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement we had with the investors 
during the twelve months ended december  synergy sold certain new jersey state tax loss carry forwards under a state economic development program for cash of approximately  this state tax benefit was recorded as other income and as of december  we had no remaining new jersey state tax loss carry forwards available for sale 
net loss for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  reported for the twelve months ended december   increased for the reasons discussed above 
the beneficial conversion dividend accreted to the series a preferred stockholders  upon issuance in the quarter ended december   was  resulting in a net loss available to common stockholders of  for the twelve months ended december  this compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of  reported for the twelve months ended december   during which period we had no preferred share transactions and thus no beneficial conversion feature that needed to be accreted as a dividend 
years ended december  and december  we had no revenues during the twelve months ended december  and because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products and we do not expect to have such products for several years  if at all 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the single most significant factor contributing to this increase in research and development expense was our l annamycin project where our program expenses increased to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  we started our work on l annamycin in the latter part of  and incurred approximately  in expenses during the twelve months ended december   primarily limited to a  initial license fee   in patent related legal fees paid to the university of texas m 
d 
anderson cancer center and approximately  incurred with our clinical consultant to begin the process of developing protocols and obtaining investigational review board irb approvals to start our trials 
atiprimod clinical trial expenses which include patient costs  drug formulation and tableting  data collection  monitoring  insurance  and fda consultants increased approximately  or to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  also contributing to this increase in research and development expense in the twelve months ended december  were salaries and wages in the amount of  compared to  during the twelve months ended december   increasing approximately  or 
the increase was a result of hiring a chief medical officer  an in house patent agent and several clinical trial associates to manage our clinical activities 
stock based compensation attributable to research and development employees  recorded as research and development expense during the twelve months ended december   totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  this decrease of approximately  was primarily attributable to the restructuring of dr 
kunwar m 
shailubhai s employment agreement during  which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  during the twelve months ended december  government grant funding for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  our funding was for work on a biodefense partnership grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to develop a monoclonal antibody and vaccine against bacterial superantigen toxins under our august  license with rockefeller university 
our funding was from a grant from the national institutes of health for studies on atiprimod 
we request grant funding to reimburse research and development expenses as incurred and this reimbursement has been reported on our consolidated statements of operations as a separate line item entitled government grant 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase was due primarily to approximately i  of increased investor relations costs  ii  in higher consulting fees for strategic planning and capital markets advice  iii  in higher personnel expenses primarily employee group insurance  payroll taxes and recruitment fees associated with staffing growth and iv  in higher costs related to our work on compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of stock based compensation attributable to general and administrative employees  recorded as general and administrative expense during the twelve months ended december   totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  purchased in process research and development was and  for the twelve months ended december  and respectively 
the expense was primarily in connection with the acquisition of rights to two key patents from houston pharmaceuticals  inc stock based compensation attributable to non employee consultants and advisors was  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the previous year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the expense associated with warrants we issued to trilogy capital partners to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes methodology is  which was recorded as stock based compensation expense over the twelve month term of the service agreement entered into on july  during the twelve months ended december  the amortization of the trilogy warrant stock based compensation totaled  whereas we had no such expense during the twelve months ended december  during december and synergy sold certain new jersey state tax loss carry forwards under a state economic development program for cash of approximately  and  respectively  the proceeds of which were used to support research and development activities in new jersey 
this state tax benefit was recorded as other income during the fourth quarters ended december  and as of december  synergy had no remaining new jersey state tax loss carry forwards available for sale 
net loss for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  reported for the twelve months ended december  the increased net loss is primarily the result of higher research  development  general and administrative expenses discussed above net of lower stock based compensation and purchased in process r d 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  as of december  this increase in cash of  during the twelve months ended december  was principally the result of approximately million of cash provided from fund raising activities  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million during the twelve months ended december  from october until january  we placed  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and  warrants to certain investors for aggregate gross proceeds of  as of december  we had closed on  shares of such series a convertible preferred stock for aggregate gross proceeds of  the final traunche of this financing closed january  when we placed  shares of such series a convertible preferred stock for aggregate gross proceeds of  the shares of series a convertible preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the investors also are parties to a registration rights agreement  dated as of october  pursuant to which we agreed to file  within days of closing  a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec covering the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the series a convertible preferred stock and the warrants issued to the investors 
the warrants are immediately exercisable at per share  will expire five years from the date of issuance  and have certain antidilution rights for the twelve month period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement registering the shares of common stock underlying the warrants 
we paid aggregate fees and expenses of   prior to december  in cash  issued an aggregate  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and  warrants to purchase common stock to certain selling agents 
the warrants are immediately exercisable at per share  will expire five years after issuance and have the same anti dilutive rights as the investor warrants 
on january  we filed a registration statement on form s registering the common stock issuable upon i the conversion of the all series a convertible preferred stock  ii the exercise of all related investor warrants and iii the exercise of all selling agent warrants 
on february  amendment no

because this transaction was completed with certain existing institutional shareholders and certain members of our management we paid no fees to selling agents  and legal fees were  our capital resources are focused primarily on the clinical development and regulatory approval of l annamycin for acute leukemia and atiprimod for multiple myeloma  advanced carcinoid cancer  and bone resorption disease  a major complication associated with multiple myeloma 
our product development efforts are thus in their early stages and we cannot make estimates of the costs or the time it will take to complete 
the risk of completion of any program is high because of the long duration of clinical testing  extended regulatory approval and review cycles and uncertainty of the costs 
net cash inflows from any products developed may take several years to achieve 
we will need additional funding to complete these activities 
we could however receive grants  contracts or technology licenses in the short term 
the amount and timing of these inflows  if any  is not known 
our consolidated financial statements as of december  have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the year ending december  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report dated april  that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing  attain further operating efficiencies and  ultimately  to generate revenue 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we will be required to raise additional capital within the next year to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates and to continue to fund operations at the current cash expenditure levels 
to date  our sources of cash have been primarily limited to the sale of our equity securities 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms  we may have to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue the development and or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates 
we also may be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  and relinquish license or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on unfavorable terms 
contractual obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of december   and is based on information appearing in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total less than year years years more than years operating leases facilities purchase obligation principally consulting services minimum spending obligations license royalty payments total obligations we have licensed patents from other companies and institutions under certain license agreements 
this line item represents our minimum obligations to spend monies for product development and commercialization as set forth in each license 
this line item represents our minimum license fee payments to i anormed  inc for our atiprimod license and ii the university of texas md anderson cancer center for our degrasyns license 
our patent license agreements also include milestone royalty payments to be paid in cash upon the achievement of certain regulatory approval and product commercialization goals 
these milestone payments have not been estimated because of the uncertainty surrounding the duration of on going early stage clinical trials and the extent of regulatory approval and review cycles 
since inception we have never achieved regulatory approval of any of our proposed products and we do not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products  and do not expect to have such for several years 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the terms of our license agreements for purposes of this schedule we have assumed that all patents not commercialized within years will be abandoned  license agreements will be terminated and associated minimum license fee payments will cease
