critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest 
also  if we ever have variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  we will consolidate those entities 
we do not currently have variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity includes assessing our level of involvement in establishing the entity  determining whether we provide more than half of any management  operational or financial support to the entity  and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or returns 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
page 
table of contents we use the cost method to account for investments in entities that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 
revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 
nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar nextel cup and nascar busch series schedules 
event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar nextel cup and nascar busch series event 
under the terms of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar nextel cup or nascar busch series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining percent to the event promoter 
the event promoter pays percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event as part of awards to the competitors 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative fair value 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
accounts receivable 
we regularly review the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired including recognized intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar  grand american and or irl 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 are recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain preacquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or page 
table of contents construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised of assets having finite useful lives  which are amortized over that period  and goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
current accounting standards require testing these assets for impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or annually  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future  our analyses are subjective and are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our judgments with regard to our future business prospects could impact whether or not an impairment is deemed to have occurred  as well as the timing of the recognition of such an impairment charge 
our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including general liability  workers compensation  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are estimated by considering various historical trends and forward looking assumptions related to costs  claim counts and payments 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for tax audit issues  including interest and penalties  based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have an impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if either the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible or an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred

all the above transactions closed on february   for a total purchase price of approximately million 
these transactions will be accounted for as a business combination 
we believe that chicagoland speedway and route are uniquely attractive assets well positioned in the nation s third largest media market 
the region boasts a strong motorsports fan base  demonstrated by six consecutive years of season ticket sell outs at chicagoland speedway since opening in we believe our active representation on raceway associates management committee since and extensive knowledge of the motorsports business will help ensure a seamless integration into isc

table of contents impairment of long lived assets during fiscal  we announced our intention to search for a site for a major motorsports entertainment facility in the new york metropolitan area see future liquidity

equity and other investments motorsports authentics on august   we partnered with smi in a joint venture  smisc  which  through a wholly owned subsidiary motorsports authentics  llc  conducts business under the name motorsports authentics 
motorsports authentics operates as an independent company with us and smi as equal owners 
also on august   we announced that smisc had entered into a definitive agreement dated august   to purchase the stock of action performance companies  inc action

proximities is a variable interest entity as determined in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
we do not consolidate the operations of proximities as we are not the primary beneficiary 
the maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with proximities at november  is approximately  limited partnership agreement in october we entered into a limited partnership agreement with group motoris international gmi to organize  promote and hold certain racing events at circuit gilles villeneuve  including a nascar busch series and grand american rolex sports car series presented by crown royal special reserve race weekend in the third quarter of fiscal circuit gilles villeneuve is a road course located in montr al  quebec  at which gmi currently promotes a successful f canadian grand prix event 
the agreement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in fiscal page 
table of contents future trends in operating results our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal in january  nascar announced it would entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of nascar nextel cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
nascar approved realignments of certain nascar nextel cup and other events at our facilities for the  and seasons 
we believe that the realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  additional net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
nascar has indicated that it is open to discussion regarding additional date realignments 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these future opportunities 
fiscal was our last year under nascar s multi year consolidated television broadcast rights agreements with nbc sports  turner sports  fox and fx 
these agreements cover the domestic broadcast of nascar s nextel cup and busch series racing seasons from through under these agreements  television rights fees increased approximately percent for the industry in fiscal television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar nextel cup and nascar busch series events conducted at our wholly owned facilities for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
nascar has entered into new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed beginning in for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series 
the agreements are expected to total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the current contract average of million annually 
the industry rights fees are expected to approximate million for  with increases  on average  of approximately three percent per year through the season 
the annual increase is expected to vary between two and four percent per year over the period 
while the rights fees will be less than the rights fees of approximately million  in our opinion this should not overshadow the strategic importance and expected long term benefits of the new contracts 
over the past several years  there has been a shift of major sports programming from network to cable 
the cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which has resulted in increased rights fees for these sports properties 
cable  however  reaches far fewer households than network broadcasts 
we view nascar s decision to keep approximately two thirds of its event schedule on network television as important to the sport s future growth 
the structure should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three racing series  which will help fuel our long term attendance and corporate related revenues 
we also welcome the chance to re establish the sport s broadcast relationship with espn  which we believe will result in further exposure for nascar racing 
first  we believe the nascar busch series will significantly benefit from the improved continuity of its season long presence on espn 
in addition  we believe the sport as a whole will benefit from the increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to what espn does with the other major sports 
the most significant benefit of the new contracts is the substantial increase in earnings and cash flow visibility for the entire industry over the contract period 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series events as part of prize and point fund money 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
we anticipate any operating margin improvement to come primarily from economies of scale and controlling costs in areas such as motorsports related and general and administrative expenses 
page 
table of contents economic conditions may impact our ability to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
however  we believe that our presence in key markets and impressive portfolio of events are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing marketing partnerships and establish new corporate marketing partners 
we believe that revenues from our corporate marketing partnerships will continue to grow over the long term 
an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing closely on supply and demand regarding additional capacity at our facilities 
we continually evaluate the demand for our most popular racing events in order to add capacity that we believe will provide an acceptable rate of return on invested capital 
through prudent expansion  we attempt to keep demand at a higher level than supply  which stimulates ticket renewals and advance sales 
advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual and forecasted inclement weather on ticket sales 
while we will join with sponsors to offer promotions to generate additional ticket sales  we avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
we recognize that a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment and other lifestyle and business conditions  can negatively impact attendance at our events 
accordingly  we have instituted only modest increases in our weighted average ticket prices for fiscal in addition  we are limiting the expansion of our facilities in fiscal to projects at our richmond international raceway richmond which will be completed in time for its nascar nextel cup and busch series spring events 
richmond will be removing approximately  obstructed view grandstand seats from turns and and are adding approximately  grandstand seats in a new  state of the art  story structure located in turn the new  three tiered grandstand will also include a person  members only club for individual fans looking to enjoy a race weekend in style or businesses seeking to entertain clients 
the club will also serve as a unique site for special events on non race weekends throughout the year 
we will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities  as well as the pricing and packaging of our tickets and other products  on an ongoing basis 
over the long term  we plan to continue to expand capacity at our speedways 
since we compete with newer entertainment venues for patrons and sponsors  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our facilities  thereby producing additional revenue generating opportunities for us and improving the experience for our guests 
one major example of these efforts is the infield renovation at daytona international speedway daytona that was completed for the start of the racing season 
the infield renovation features numerous fan amenities and unique revenue generating opportunities  including garage walk through areas  additional merchandise and concessions vending areas  waterfront luxury recreational vehicle parking areas  a large tunnel to accommodate team haulers and guest recreational vehicles in and out of the infield and other special amenities such as the infield s signature structure  the daytona club 
the fan and guest response to our renovation efforts at daytona has been overwhelmingly positive and has resulted in incremental direct and  we believe  indirect revenue generation 
another example of our efforts to enhance the fan experience includes the fiscal renovation of michigan international speedway s michigan front stretch  including new ticket gates  new vendor and display areas  and several new concession stands  as well as the addition of club seats and luxury suites 
for fiscal  we completed additional renovation projects at california speedway california and talladega superspeedway talladega 
at california  we renovated and expanded the facility s front midway area 
the new plaza features a full service outdoor caf with cuisine by celebrity chef wolfgang puck  in addition to a town center  retail store and concert stage 
other highlights include shade features  modified entry gates  expanded hospitality areas  radio broadcast locations  giant video walls  leisure areas and grass and water accents 
this project was the direct result of fan feedback  and further demonstrates our commitment to providing a premium entertainment environment for our guests 
we also repaved talladega s mile oval in time for that facility s fall nascar nextel cup weekend 
talladega s racing surface had not been repaved since  and we believe the newly paved racing surface enhanced the thrilling on track competition

table of contents daytona international speedway lease extension on march   daytona amended its lease agreement with the daytona beach racing and recreational facilities district the district 
the amended lease extends the relationship between daytona and the district through november  the new lease required an initial annual payment  excluding applicable sales taxes  of  and includes scheduled rent increases every five years 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require the total lease cost over the revised lease term to be recognized on a straight line basis 
as a result  this lease expense in fiscal  including sales taxes  totaled approximately  for fiscal years through  we anticipate this lease expense  including sales taxes  to approximate  per year 
current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to such routine litigation incident to our business  we are a party to the litigation described below 
in july  kentucky speedway  llc filed a civil action in the eastern district of kentucky against nascar and us alleging that nascar and isc have acted  and continue to act  individually and in combination and collusion with each other and other companies that control motorsports entertainment facilities hosting nascar nextel cup series  to illegally restrict the award of 
nascar nextel cup series 
races 
the complaint seeks damages and an injunction requiring nascar to establish a competitive bidding process for nextel cup events and prohibiting further violations of the antitrust laws 
other than some vaguely conclusory allegations  the complaint fails to specify any conduct by international speedway corporation isc other than conducting and growing its motorsports entertainment business for the benefit of its shareholders 
we believe the allegations to be without merit and intend to defend ourself vigorously 
we have retained counsel and are pursuing defenses to the suit while maintaining potential counterclaim remedies available to us to recover the damages caused by the filing of the suit 
the court has established a february  deadline for the completion of pre trial discovery factual matters which is to be followed by discovery of expert opinion matters 
based upon the current timeline a trial on the merits of the case is scheduled for no earlier than fall while it is premature to quantify either the likelihood or the potential magnitude of an adverse decision  the fees and expenses associated with the defense of this suit are not covered by insurance and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows  even if we ultimately prevail 
further  the time devoted to this matter by management and the possible impact of litigation on business negotiations occurring prior to resolution of this matter could also adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows 
finally  even if the direct effect of the resolution of this case does not result in a material adverse impact on us  it is possible that the resolution of this case could result in industry wide changes in the way race schedules are determined by sanctioning bodies  which could indirectly have a material adverse impact on us 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events the postponement or cancellation of one or more major motorsports events could adversely impact our future operating results 
a postponement or cancellation could be caused by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  inclement weather  a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis  a general postponement or cancellation of all major sporting events in this country as occurred following the september  terrorist attacks  a terrorist attack at any mass gathering or fear of such an attack  conditions resulting from the war in iraq or other acts or prospects of war

our effective tax rate increased from percent to percent during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily a result of certain state tax implications relating to the aforementioned impairment of long lived assets 
the increase is partially offset by one time benefits relating to discrete items in the second fiscal quarter of  including the implementation of certain restructuring initiatives  the finalization of certain state tax matters and deposits made during fiscal and with the service to stop the accrual of interest on contested items in our ongoing federal tax examination

the operations of nazareth are presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
in fiscal  discontinued operations include a  after tax non cash gain related to the decision made in the fourth quarter to relocate and use certain grandstand assets from nazareth to darlington  which had previously been written off 
as a result of the foregoing  our net income decreased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal compared to fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal the comparison of fiscal to fiscal is impacted by the following factors in july  we acquired the assets and assumed the operations and certain liabilities of martinsville 
the timing of the acquisition in fiscal resulted in an incremental nascar nextel cup and craftsman truck series event during fiscal  during fiscal  we sold the assets and operations of north carolina and made a decision to pursue the sale of nazareth due to the realignment of nazareth s events to our watkins glen facility starting with the event season 
accordingly  the results of operations for north carolina and nazareth are recorded as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no

admissions revenue increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to the previously discussed timing of the acquisition of martinsville  realignment of events to watkins glen  the net impact of the realignment of events to phoenix from darlington  increased attendance for the nascar events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting our sold out daytona  rescheduling of the nascar craftsman truck series event at michigan from the irl weekend in fiscal to the june nascar nextel cup weekend in fiscal  resulting in increased attendance and weighted average ticket price  and increased attendance for the remaining darlington nascar weekend 
these increases are partially offset by certain admissions decreases including attendance for the california nascar nextel cup and busch series events conducted in the first quarter of fiscal motorsports related revenue increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to increased television broadcast rights fees  sponsorship  hospitality and other race related revenues for comparable nascar nextel cup weekends hosted at our facilities as well the timing of the acquisition of martinsville and the realignment of events to watkins glen 
the net impact of realignment of events to phoenix from darlington also contributed to the current year increase 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to catering  merchandise and concession operations for comparable nascar nextel cup weekends  the net impact of realignment of events to phoenix from darlington  the timing of the acquisition of martinsville and higher revenues resulting from increased attendance  hospitality units and additional points of sale in the newly renovated infield for events during speedweeks at daytona 
these increases are partially offset by decreases primarily related to our americrown subsidiary performing services at non isc venues in fiscal prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in television broadcast rights fees for comparable nascar nextel cup and busch series events held at page 
table of contents our facilities as standard nascar sanctioning agreements require that a specified percentage of television broadcast rights fees be paid to competitors 
the previously discussed realignment of the nascar busch series event to watkins glen also contributed to the increase  as well as the timing of the acquisition of martinsville 
motorsports related expenses increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily related to increased operating expenses for comparable events during the periods  including operating expenses associated with the previously discussed daytona infield renovation  certain strategic consumer and corporate marketing initiatives and services donated to hurricane relief efforts 
increases during fiscal also included the realignment of events to watkins glen  the net impact of realignment of events to phoenix from darlington and the timing of the acquisition of martinsville 
motorsports related expenses as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports related revenue increased to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal  primarily due to the previously discussed expenses as well as the expenses and the sanction fee for the realigned watkins glen irl event 
these increases are partially offset by increased revenues from the television broadcast rights fees and the timing of the martinsville acquisition 
food  beverage and merchandise expense increased million  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to event related costs  including increases associated with the additional events at martinsville and the realignment of events to phoenix from darlington  certain merchandise inventory writedowns and inventory donated to hurricane relief efforts 
these increases are partially offset by services at non isc venues in fiscal food  beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food  beverage merchandise revenue increased to approximately percent for fiscal as compared to percent for fiscal the increases are primarily related to previously discussed inventory writedowns  increased operating and selling costs associated with an expanded merchandising strategy implemented in late fiscal and donated merchandise 
also contributing to the increase for fiscal is the lower margin upscale catering cuisine offered in the new nextel fanzone and daytona club during speedweeks 
these increases are partially offset by our americrown subsidiary performing lower margin services at non isc venues in fiscal year and the realignment of events to phoenix from darlington 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases are primarily related to a net increase in certain costs related to the growth of our core business  expenses associated with the timing of the acquisition of martinsville  hurricane repair costs associated with storms in late fiscal and a non cash charge associated with certain asset replacements at richmond 
these increases are partially offset by the recovery of a portion of the previously recorded bad debt expense related to our claim against cart  non cash charges associated with the net book value of certain undepreciated assets removed during the renovation of daytona s infield and michigan s frontstretch during fiscal  and a decrease in professional fees and strategic development expenses 
during fiscal  we reached settlement with the cart liquidation trust that allowed a claim in our favor of million in the cart bankruptcy 
the claim was based on the failure to return the sanction fee paid to cart  less allowable expenses  for the event scheduled in california that was canceled because of the state of emergency due to wildfires in southern california at the time 
the us bankruptcy court  southern district of indiana  approved the good faith settlement at a hearing in may  and we recovered the full million of the allowed claim 
accordingly  we recorded the million recovery as a reduction of bad debt expense during fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from approximately percent to percent primarily due to increased television broadcast revenues  the recovery in the cart settlement  decreases in professional and strategic development expenses  increases in revenues for speedweeks at daytona and the previously discussed incremental martinsville events 
the decreases are partially offset by previously page 
table of contents noted net increases in general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the daytona infield renovation project  certain retail technology projects  the michigan front stretch reconfiguration project  the acquisition of martinsville  and other ongoing capital spending 
interest income increased by approximately  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to higher yield on short term investments in the current periods partially offset by lower outstanding cash and short term investment balances 
interest expense decreased approximately million  or percent  during fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in capitalized interest  primarily related to land purchased for the proposed construction of a speedway in staten island  new york and  to a lesser extent  certain other construction projects contributed to the decrease in interest expense 
also contributing to the decrease in fiscal is our may   refinancing of million percent senior notes issued in october and due october   senior notes with million percent senior notes due  and million percent senior notes due collectively the senior notes issued on april  to a lesser extent  the incremental interest on the senior notes from april  to may  contributed to lower interest expense in fiscal equity in net income from equity investments represents our pro rata share of the current income from our percent equity investment in raceway associates and our percent equity investment in motorsports authentics

northwest us speedway development in light of nascar s publicly announced position regarding additional potential realignment of the nascar nextel cup series schedule  we also believe there are potential development opportunities in other new  underserved markets across the country 
as such  we have been and are exploring opportunities for public private partnerships targeted to develop one or more motorsports entertainment facilities in new markets  including the northwest us 
in june  we announced we had identified a preferred site for the development of a motorsports entertainment facility in kitsap county  washington  approximately miles outside of seattle  washington  the country s th largest media market 
we have secured an option to purchase approximately acres for the potential future home of a professional motorsports and entertainment and family recreation facility including a closed course speedway  grandstands and other seating with capacity for at least  attendees  which could open in we are conducting ongoing project due diligence to review environmental impacts including traffic  noise  air quality  and others  if any 
state legislation is required to create a public speedway authority psa and authorize the issuance of general obligation bonds to help finance the project 
these bonds would be repaid through a sales tax credit issued by the state to the psa  and from a local tax on the facility 
the legislation would require us to invest a minimum of approximately million in the project  among other obligations 
we expect to introduce the required legislation into the session of the washington legislature in hopes of successfully completing this stage of the process 
while we remain optimistic about our ability to construct a motorsports and multi use recreational facility in this region of the country  it is too early to tell if the necessary public participation will materialize or if it will be sufficient to allow for the development of such a facility 
new york metropolitan speedway development during fiscal  we announced our intention to search for a site for a major motorsports entertainment facility in the new york metropolitan area 
our efforts included the evaluation of many different locations 
most recently  we identified a combination of land parcels in the new york city borough of staten island aggregating approximately acres that we targeted for the development of a major motorsports entertainment and retail development project 
our majority owned subsidiary  development  purchased the total acres for approximately million in early fiscal in december  we announced our decision to discontinue pursuit of a speedway development on staten island 
the decision was driven by a variety of factors  including the inability to secure the critical local political support that is necessary to secure the required land use change approvals for a speedway development  even if we had secured the necessary political support  it became apparent that we would have been faced with unacceptable approval requirements  including operational restrictions that would have made the facility difficult to operate and a significant challenge to market  and the increased risk that these unacceptable approval requirements could result in higher construction spending and annual operating costs  which would have a significant negative impact on the financial model for the speedway development 
page 
table of contents our operating and development agreements with the related companies have been terminated  the note payable to us from related which was secured by a pledge of related s percent proportionate minority interest in development has been cancelled and the minority interest surrendered to us 
the decision to discontinue our speedway development efforts on staten island  in our fiscal fourth quarter  resulted in a non cash  pre tax charge in our results of approximately million  or per diluted share after tax 
accounting rules generally accepted in the us require that the property be valued at its current fair value  which is estimated by an independent appraisal at approximately million 
prior to the write off  we had capitalized spending of approximately million through november   including million for land and related improvements  million for costs related solely to the development of the speedway  and million for capitalized interest and property taxes 
the value of the property is expected to be in excess of million once it is filled and ready for sale 
in september  as a result of communications from the new york state department of environmental conservation dec and the new york city department of sanitation dos  which provide oversight for the fill operations at the site  we ceased fill operations while we address certain issues they raised 
we continue to work with these agencies to resolve these issues and anticipate being able to resume fill operations in the coming months 
we have begun to research and develop market demand studies to assist in the evaluation of various alternative strategies for the staten island acreage  including potentially selling the property in whole or in parts  or developing the property with a third party for some other use 
given that the property is the largest undeveloped acreage of land in the five boroughs of new york city  we believe it will be attractive to a wide range of developers and users 
the site is currently zoned as of right for industrial use and could provide ease of access through a deep water dock located on site 
also  the property can be easily accessed from the local highway system 
although we are disappointed that our speedway development efforts were unsuccessful on staten island  we remain committed to pursuing the development of a motorsports entertainment facility in the region 
due to the considerable interest in and support for nascar racing in the metro new york market  we believe a premier motorsports entertainment facility will have a significant positive impact on the area s economy and prove to be a long term community asset 
joint venture development in may  we announced we are pursuing a joint venture for the development of a commercial mixed use entertainment shopping center project on approximately acres we currently own 
located directly across international speedway boulevard us highway from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility  the acreage currently includes several office buildings that house our corporate headquarters and certain related operations of ours and nascar 
the total project  which will be developed by us and the page 
table of contents joint venture  is anticipated to be comprised of retail  entertainment  office and residential components designed to complement surrounding commercial developments 
we are currently negotiating a joint venture agreement with a developer and are also completing our detailed feasibility study in which a number of key issues will be addressed 
provided we are able to enter into an agreement with this developer and the results of the feasibility study are favorable and appropriate leasing considerations are attained  we expect to move forward with the project within the next three months 
if we proceed with the project it is expected that certain of our existing corporate headquarter offices and other buildings  which are not currently fully depreciated  will be razed during the next to months resulting in a yet to be determined  non cash charge to earnings 
internal revenue service examination the service is currently performing a periodic examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended november  through and has challenged the tax depreciation treatment of a significant portion of our motorsports entertainment facility assets 
through november   we have received reports from the service requesting downward adjustments to our tax depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended november  through  which could potentially result in the reclassification of approximately million of income taxes from deferred to current 
including related interest  the combined after tax cash flow impact of these requested adjustments is approximately million 
in order to prevent incurring additional interest  we have deposited approximately million  with the service 
in december  we received a report from the service with respect to our fiscal year ended november   which could potentially result in the the reclassification of approximately million of income taxes from deferred to current 
accordingly  in order to prevent incurring additional interest  we deposited an additional million with the service in january additional adjustments to our tax depreciation expense are expected to be requested later by the service for the fiscal year ended november  including related interest  we estimate the combined after tax cash flow impact of the additional federal tax adjustments for fiscal  and related state tax revisions for all periods  to range between million and million at november  our deposits are not a payment of tax  and we will receive accrued interest on any of these funds ultimately returned to us 
at november   the approximately million of previously discussed deposits with the service are classified as long term assets in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our application of the federal income tax regulations in question  which have been applied consistently since being adopted in and have been subjected to previous irs audits  is appropriate  and we intend to vigorously defend the merits of our position 
once commenced by the service  the administrative appeals process is expected to take six to fifteen months to complete 
if our appeal is not resolved satisfactorily  we will evaluate all of our options  including litigation 
it is important to note the federal american jobs creation act of legislation  which was effective on october   provides owners of motorsports entertainment facility assets a seven year recovery period for tax depreciation purposes 
the motorsports provision applies prospectively from the date of enactment through january  we and others in the industry are pursuing a seven year prospective tax depreciation provision 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we have accrued a deferred tax liability based on the differences between our financial reporting and tax bases of such assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of november  while an adverse resolution of these matters could result in a material negative impact on cash flow  including payment of taxes from amounts currently on deposit with the service  we believe that we have provided adequate reserves related to these matters including interest charges through november  totaling approximately million  and  as a result  do not expect that such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on results of operations

table of contents future cash flows our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations and approved capital projects at existing facilities for the foreseeable future  payments required in connection with the purchase of additional interests in raceway associates  payments required in connection with the funding of the unified government s debt service requirements related to the tif bonds  payments related to our existing debt service commitments  any potential payments associated with our keepwell agreements  any payment of tax that may ultimately occur as a result of the examination by the service  and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the current legal proceeding discussed in part ii legal proceedings 
we intend to pursue further development and or acquisition opportunities including the possible development of new motorsports entertainment facilities  such as the new york metropolitan area  the northwest us and other areas  the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments  of which are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors relating to consumer and corporate spending  including economic conditions affecting marketing dollars available from the motorsports industry s principal sponsors 
consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by economic  security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the war in iraq and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to maintain a balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we did not have any variable debt outstanding  therefore  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by percent would not result in an increase in our interest expense 
at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates would be approximately million at november  from time to time we utilize derivative investments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the debt they are intended to modify 
at november  we did not have any interest rate swap agreements in place 
credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
