trademarks the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  kenneth cole productions lic  inc  owns federal registrations for its principal trademarks kenneth cole  kenneth cole new york  kenneth cole reaction  reaction  kenneth cole collection  tribeca and unlisted as well as several other ancillary and derivative trademarks 
each of the federal registrations is currently in full force and effect and is not the subject of any legal proceedings 
in addition  the company has several federal applications pending in the united states patent and trademark office for trademarks and service marks 
moreover  the company continues to expand its current international registrations in numerous countries throughout the world 
the company regards its trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets in the marketing and distribution of its products  and fully intends to maintain  renew and protect the registrations  as well as vigorously defend all of its trademarks against infringements 
competition competition in the footwear and handbag industries is intense and these product classifications are subject to rapidly changing consumer demands 
the company competes with numerous designers  brands and manufacturers of footwear  handbags  apparel and accessories  some of which may be larger  have achieved greater recognition for their brand names  have captured greater market share and or have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than the company 
the company also competes for the limited shelf space available for the display of its products to consumers  and the company s licensed apparel and accessories also compete with a substantial number of designer and non designer brands 
moreover  the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows access by new market entrants 
the company believes the success of its business depends on its ability to stimulate and respond to changing consumer preferences by producing innovative and attractive products  brands and marketing  while remaining competitive in quality and price 
foreign operations the company s business is subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates  local market conditions  labor unrest  political instability  actions of a public enemy  military or other government intervention  priorities  restrictions or allocations and the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports  including quotas  duties or taxes and other charges on imports 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations in the future 
in order to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  the company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts to protect the future purchase price of inventory denominated in euro 
these euro forward exchange contracts are used to reduce the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and are not held for the purpose of trading or speculation see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
import restrictions although most of the goods sourced by the company are not currently subject to quotas  countries in which the company s products are manufactured may  from time to time  impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products 
in addition  the united states may impose new duties  tariffs and other restrictions on imported products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and its ability to import its products at current or increased quantity levels 
in accordance with the harmonized tariff schedule  a fixed duty structure in effect for the united states  the company pays import duties on its products 
the majority of its products have import duties that range from approximately to  depending on the category and the principal component of the product 
other restrictions on the importation of footwear and other products are periodically considered by the united states government and no assurance can be given that tariffs or duties on the company s goods may not be raised  resulting in higher costs to the company  or that import quotas restricting such goods may not be imposed or made more restrictive 
seasonality the company s products are marketed primarily for fall and spring seasons  with slightly higher volume of wholesale products sold during the first and third quarters 
the company s retail business follows the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail industry sales and earnings are highest in the fourth quarter and weakest in the first quarter 
because the timing of wholesale shipments of products for any season may vary from year to year  the results for any one quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full year 
customers the company s department store customers include major united states retailers  several of which are under common ownership 
in and  the company had no customer or group under common ownership account for more than of consolidated sales 
the company s ten largest customers represented and of the company s net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while the company believes that purchasing decisions have generally been made independently by each division within a department store group  there is a trend among department store groups toward centralized purchasing decisions of their divisions 
backlog the company had unfilled wholesale customer orders of million and million at february  and february   respectively 
the company s backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors  including seasonality  timing of market weeks and wholesale customer purchases of its core basic products through the company s open stock program 
accordingly  a comparison of backlog from period to period may not be indicative of eventual shipments 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts  and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
employees at december   the company had approximately  employees which includes  part time employees  none of whom are covered under a collective bargaining agreement 
the company considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory 
the company had a collective bargaining agreement  which expired in april  at which time it outsourced its distribution operation and closed its new jersey distribution center 
prior to that  the company utilized a local affiliate of the international leather goods  plastics  handbags and novelty workers union  local  division of local united food and commercial workers union 
in connection with this transition in  the company incurred approximately million in aggregate costs  including severance  the write off of unamortized leasehold improvements and moving costs during these costs were expensed as incurred in accordance with sfas no

risk factors the company operates in a changing environment that involves numerous known risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect its operations 
the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and in the future could affect the company s operations 
additional risks that the company does not yet know of or that it currently thinks are immaterial may also affect business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
the company may not be able to respond to changing fashion and consumer demands in a timely manner 
the footwear  apparel and accessory industries are subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends 
the company believes that its success depends in large part upon its ability to identify and interpret fashion trends and to anticipate and respond to such trends in a timely manner 
the company has generally been successful in this regard but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to meet changing consumer demands or to develop successful styles in the future 
if the company misjudges the market for a particular product or product line  it may result in an increased inventory of unsold and outdated finished goods  which may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any failure by the company to identify or respond to changing demands and trends could  in the long term  adversely affect consumer acceptance of the company s brand names  which may have an adverse effect on the company s business and prospects 
the company intends to market additional lines of footwear  apparel and fashion accessories in the future 
as is typical with new products  demand and market acceptance for any new products introduce by the company will be subject to uncertainty 
achieving market acceptance for each of these products may require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create customer demand 
there can be no assurance that the company s marketing effort will successfully generate sales or that the company will have the funds necessary to undertake such an effort 
the company s sales are influenced by general economic cycles 
footwear  apparel and accessories are cyclical industries dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending 
our customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by reducing inventories and canceling orders 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  increases in energy costs or interest rates  acts of nature or political events that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the regions in which we compete  could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the footwear  apparel and accessory industries are highly competitive 
any increased competition could result in reduced sales or margins 
competition in the footwear  apparel and accessory industries is intense 
the company s products compete with other branded products within their product categories as well as with private label products sold by retailers  including some of the company s customers 
in varying degrees  depending on the product category involved  the company competes on the basis of style  price  quality  comfort and brand prestige and recognition  among other considerations 
the company also competes with numerous manufacturers  importers and distributors of footwear  apparel and accessories for the limited shelf space available for the display of such product to the consumer 
moreover  the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows ease of access by new market entrants 
some of the company s competitors are larger  have achieved greater recognition for their brand names  have captured greater market share and or have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than the company 
the loss of any of the company s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial results 
although currently no customer comprises more than ten percent of the company s customer base  should one of its larger customers be negatively impacted  it could adversely affect the company s business 
in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes 
in the future  retailers may have financial problems or consolidate  undergo restructurings or reorganizations  or realign their affiliations  any of which could further increase the concentration of the company s customers 
the loss of any of the company s largest customers  or the bankruptcy or material financial difficulty of any customer  could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers  and sales to customers generally occur on an order by order basis 
as a result  customers can terminate their relationships with the company at any time or under certain circumstances cancel or delay orders which could reduce our sales and adversely affect its business condition 
the success of the company s business depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees 
the company is heavily dependent on its current executive officers and management 
the loss of any of its executive officers or management  including but not limited to  kenneth cole  or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could delay the development and introduction of new products  harm our ability to sell products  damage the image of its brands and or prevent the company from executing its business strategy 
imposition of quotas and fluctuations in exchange rates could increase the company s costs and impact its ability to source goods 
the company s business is subject to risks of doing business abroad  including  but not limited to  fluctuations in exchange rates and the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports  including quotas  duties  taxes and other charges on imports 
in order to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  the company often enters into forward exchange contracts to protect the purchase price under its agreements with its manufacturers or purchases products in united states dollars 
the company cannot fully anticipate all of its currency needs and  therefore  cannot fully protect against the effect of such fluctuations 
although the majority of the goods sold by the company are not currently subject to quotas  countries in which the company s products are manufactured may  from time to time  impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products and the united states may impose new duties  tariffs and other restrictions on imported products  any of which could adversely affect the company s operations and its ability to import its products at the company s current or increase quantity levels 
other restrictions on the importation of footwear and the company s other products are periodically considered by the united states congress and no assurances can be given that tariffs or duties on the company s goods may not be raised 
if tariffs are raised in the future  they will result in higher costs to the company  and if import quotas are imposed or made more restrictive  the company may not be able to source its goods at historical factories or at similar prices 
the voting shares of the company s stock are concentrated in one majority shareholder 
currently  kenneth d 
cole owns approximately of the voting power and approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
cole has the ability to control i the election of all of the company s directors other than the directors who will be elected by the holders of class a common stock  voting separately as a class  and ii the results of all other shareholder votes 
mr 
cole s interests may differ from the interests of the other stockholders 
war and acts of terrorism could affect the company s ability to procure  sell and deliver product 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism or the escalation of existing hostilities  or if any are threatened  the company s ability to procure its products from its manufacturers for sale to its customers may be negatively affected 
the company imports a substantial portion of its products from other countries 
if it becomes difficult or impossible to import the company s products into the countries in which it sell its products  the company s sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
additionally  war  military responses to future international conflicts and possible future terrorist attacks may lead to a downturn in the us and or international economies  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing outside the united states 
substantially all of the company s apparel products are produced by independent manufacturers 
the company faces the risk that these third party manufacturers with whom it contracts to produce its products may not produce and deliver its products on a timely basis  or at all 
the company cannot be certain that it will not experience operational difficulties with its manufacturers  such as reductions in the availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  and failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
the failure of any manufacturer to perform to the company s expectations could result in supply shortages for certain products and harm its business 
in addition  the company s foreign manufactures may be adversely effected by addition factors such as political instability in countries where contractors and suppliers are located  imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports  imposition of duties  taxes and other charges on imports  significant fluctuation of the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries 
the capacity of the company s manufacturers to manufacture its products also is dependent  in part  upon the availability of raw materials 
the company s manufacturers may experience shortages of raw materials  which could result in delays in deliveries of its products by its manufacturers or in increased costs to the company 
any shortage of raw materials or inability of a manufacturer to manufacture or ship its products in a timely manner  or at all  could impair the company s ability to ship orders of its products in a cost efficient  timely manner and could cause the company to miss the delivery requirements of its customers 
as a result  the company could experience cancellations of orders  refusals to accept deliveries or reductions in its prices and margins  any of which could harm the company s financial performance and results of operations 
the company relies on licensees for revenues  supply of products and compliance with company standards 
the company licenses its trademarks to third parties for manufacturing  marketing  distribution and sale of various products and intend to expand its licensing programs 
while the company enters into comprehensive licensing agreements with its licensees covering product design  product quality  sourcing  manufacturing  marketing and other requirements  its licensees may not comply fully with those agreements 
non compliance could include marketing products under the company s brand names that do not meet its quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet the company s supplier code of conduct 
these activities could harm the company s brand equity  its reputation and its business 
in addition  the company s results could be affected by the results of its licensees or distributors  or the transition of any of its licensing catagories in house 
the financial difficulties of any of its partners or their failure to produce and deliver acceptable product could have an adverse impact on the company s business in the future 
in the event of a business failure of any such partner or of the breakdown of the company s relationship with any domestic or foreign partner  there is no guarantee that the company could replace such business 
the company intends to assume greater control over sportswear collections as previously announced  the company has reached agreement to end its license agreement for kenneth cole new york and kenneth cole reaction men s sportswear and kenneth cole new york women s sportswear 
the company is creating a wholesale apparel division to design source and market these products  though the company is also simultaneously considering proposals to enter into a strategic licensing agreement or similar venture with a new partner or partners for all or some of these products 
in addition to all of the risk factors listed in this section  the new wholesale apparel division will be a new business for the company subject to all the associated risks of a new business  including but not limited to  startup development costs incurred in advance of sales commencing  inability to attract and retain employees with sufficient expertise to manage these new clasifications  inexperience of existing management with direct control of the business 
new product classifications may require different methods of operations than those used in the past and may involve different customers or competitors  possible difficulties  delays or costs in integrating these lines into the business  operations  personnel or systems of the company in ways not currently anticipated by company management  and projected sales  margins and profits may not be realized 
failure to anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels could have an adverse financial effect on the company s business 
the company maintains an inventory of selected products that it anticipates will be in high demand 
the company may be unable to sell the products it ordered in advance from manufacturers or that it has in its inventory 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs or the sale of excess inventory at discounted or closeout prices 
these events could significantly harm the company s operating results and impair the image of the company s brands 
conversely  if the company underestimates consumer demand for its products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner  the company may experience inventory shortages  which may result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues 
the company relies on third parties for distribution and warehousing 
the company relies on warehousing and distribution facilities in california and new jersey 
any events at either of these facilities due to fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or manmade cause  including operational or financial hardship of the provider or its capacity  could damage a portion of the company s inventory or impair its ability to use its warehousing and distribution facilities 
outcomes of litigation or changes in regulatory control could impact the company s financial condition 
from time to time  the company may be a party to lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to its business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings  the company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings  such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that the company devotes substantial resources to defend itself 
further  changes in government regulations both in the united states and in the countries in which the company operates could have adverse affects on its business and subject it to additional regulatory actions 
the loss or infringement of the company s trademarks and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
the company believes that its trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to its success and competitive position 
accordingly  the company devotes substantial resources to the establishment and protection of its trademarks on a worldwide basis 
there can be no assurances that such actions taken to establish and protect the company s trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of the company s products as violative of their trademarks and proprietary rights 
moreover  there can be no assurances that others will not assert rights in  or ownership of  the company s trademarks and other proprietary rights or that the company will be able to successfully resolve such conflicts 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
any litigation regarding our trademarks could be time consuming and costly  and the loss of such trademarks and other proprietary rights  or the loss of the exclusive use of such trademarks and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
implementation of management information systems may impact the company s financial results 
during  the company will continue to implement the sap information management software in its retail operations and consider further expansion as an entity wide integrated system solution 
the implementation of such software could be delayed and the company may encounter computer and operational complications in connection with such implementation that could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
difficulties migrating existing systems to the new software could impact its ability to design  produce and ship its products on a timely basis 
seasonality of the company s business and the timing of new store openings could result in fluctuations in its financial performance 
the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
therefore  results of operations for any single quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results have been  and in the future will continue to be  significantly impacted by the timing of new store openings and their respective pre opening costs 
adverse publicity could negatively affect public perception of the brand 
the company s results could be substantially affected by adverse publicity resulting from its products or its advertising 
expiration of leases could result in fluctuations in the company s financial performance 
as retail store leases expire  the company may not be able to renew them on acceptable terms or secure suitable replacement locations 
while the company continues to explore new markets and is always evaluating new potential  some stores may close  and this may have an adverse impact on the financial operations of the company s consumer direct division 
the company s expectations of growth anticipate new store openings which are subject to many factors beyond its control 
future growth in sales and profits in the company s consumer direct division will depend to some extent on its ability to increase the number of stores 
the lease negotiation and development timeframes vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays 
the number and timing of new stores actually opened during any given period  and their associated contribution to net income for the period  will depend on a number of factors including  but not limited  to the identification and availability of suitable locations and leases  the availability of suitable financing to the company and its landlords  the timing of the delivery of the leased premises to the company from its landlords in order to commence build out construction activities  the company s ability and its landlords ability to obtain all necessary governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate its stores on a timely basis  the company s ability to manage the construction and development costs of new stores  and the availability and or cost of raw materials  the rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises  adverse weather during the construction period  and the hiring and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market 
any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
the effects of recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have increased insurance costs for which the company expects to take on higher deductibles if losses occur 
the company has operations in flood  hurricane and earthquake zones 
as such  the company has insured itself against losses from natural disasters 
the cost of such insurance has risen significantly as a result of the effects of recent disasters throughout the united states 
to offset such costs  the company has taken on larger deductibles which  if aggregated through multiple disaster locations  could have a material effect on our results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts  and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  as well as royalties and advertising revenues from its licensing partners 
these customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets the company performs a review of its long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
income taxes the company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal  state  or local authorities 
these audits include questioning of the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
litigation the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgements as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
stock based compensation the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under sfas r  the company measures the cost of services received in exchange for stock options and similar awards based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes this cost in the income statement over the period during which an award recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the company uses the black scholes model to assess the fair value of share based payments and amortizes this cost over the service period 
in addition  stock compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting primarily based on historical annual forfeiture rates and by employee classification 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed on a quarterly basis and may change based on new facts and circumstances

also in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no

in june  the emerging issues task force the task force issued eitf no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the issue 
the task force reached a consensus that the scope of this issue includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
the task force also reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to apb opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
an entity is not required to reevaluate its existing policies related to taxes assessed by a governmental authority as a result of this consensus 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  an entity should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
the company currently uses the net basis 
the company adopted this issue on january  and determined that it had no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data of the company as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated below net sales royalty revenue net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of long lived assets operating income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income gross profit may not be comparable to other entities  since some entities include the costs related to their distribution network receiving and warehousing in cost of goods sold and other entities  similar to the company  exclude these costs from gross profit  including them instead in a line item such as selling  general and administrative expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due to revenue increases in the company s wholesale and licensing business segments  partially offset by decreases in the company s consumer direct business 
wholesale net sales excluding sales to the consumer direct business segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to a growth in sales of kenneth cole reaction footwear and handbags of approximately  as well as single digit growth in bongo  tribeca  and unlisted footwear  offset by declines in kenneth cole new york handbags 
the company will continue to focus on product offerings  design  pricing and distribution  which it believes are the significant factors defining its brands and increasing consumer demand 
net sales in the company s consumer direct segment decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in retail store sales of million  or  as compared to year ended december  comparable store sales decreased by million  or  offset by an increase of million of new store sales in plus the portion of sales for stores not open for all of comparable stores are defined as new stores that are open for longer than thirteen months 
a store that stops operations is included in the comparable sales calculation through the date of closing 
the company believes that the lack of an effective execution of its brand elevation strategy for the company s retail stores contributed significantly to the decline in consumer direct results 
the company believes it may have elevated its prices too abruptly to create an appropriate transition for its customers 
the company is taking measures to address these issues  including certain organizational and management changes  as well as merchandising improvements 
the company has separated the merchandising and support functions between the company s company stores and its full priced retail stores 
as a result  the company believes it can initiate more effective business and merchandising practices for these stores 
the initial stage of the company s plan has been to eliminate the use of the company s company stores as clearance centers and increase the amount of specific made for company store product 
this has improved the company s presentation  margins  and resulted in positive company store comparative store sales in the fourth quarter of of 
in addition  the company is controlling inventory levels to reduce clearance product  is adjusting product mix to incorporate a wider range of price points  and is evaluating its real estate portfolio with plans to close several stores  while reviewing opportunities for new store locations for the latter half of royalty revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the incremental minimum royalties from the company s existing licensees  as well as additional royalties from two reaction licensees related to women s sportswear and the home collection  offset by declines in domestic royalty revenue from men s and women s kenneth cole new york sportswear 
the company believes sportswear is a critical component in the visibility of its brands in both its consumer direct and wholesale business segments 
in november  the company amended its license agreement with paul davril inc pdi  which covers the manufacture and distribution of men s and women s sportswear under the kenneth cole new york trademark and men s sportswear under the kenneth cole reaction trademark 
the amended agreement results in the company assuming control of its kenneth cole new york and kenneth cole reaction sportswear categories at the end of the company is transitioning the kenneth cole new york women s sportswear business  some of which the company has already been sourcing over the past two seasons and plans to assume control of the kenneth cole new york men s sportswear business during as the company absorbs the infrastructure and makes this transition  it will make a determination as to the strategic alternatives of kenneth cole reaction men s sportswear  which include entering into a strategic licensing arrangement or similar venture with a new partner or partners or assuming internal control of the business 
the company believes that taking control of the kenneth cole new york men s and women s sportswear business by the end of will result in the reduction of licensing revenue along with reduced advertising contributions and some additional infrastructure costs in the short term  but will have meaningful long term benefits 
the company believes that controlling the kenneth cole new york sportswear classification will allow it to better reinforce each of its brands and all of the associated businesses  most particularly the consumer direct business 
the amendment of the pdi license is expected to cause a reduction in licensing royalties of approximately million to million before considering any growth in other licenses 
in addition  incremental advertising and infrastructure costs of approximately million to million are expected before implementing any mitigating actions 
consolidated gross profit decreased to in  as a percentage of net revenues  compared to in this decrease was primarily a result of decreases in the consumer direct margins  offset by an increase in wholesale margins  and the change in mix of the company s net revenues from its three segments 
the consumer direct segment  which typically operates at a higher gross profit level than the wholesale segment  had decreased revenues as a percentage of net revenues of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   while the wholesale segment revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the revenues in the licensing segment  which carries no cost of goods sold  also decreased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in wholesale margins is primarily due to strong sell thrus at retail of kenneth cole reaction branded product  while the margins in consumer direct decreased due to additional clearance activity  during the first three quarters of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  including warehousing and receiving expenses  decreased as a percentage of net revenues to million in  which included impairment charges of approximately million  from of net revenues million in  which included severance costs of approximately million in stock based compensation expense amounted to million and is included in sg a expenses 
excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  sg a expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  would have been for the year ended december   as compared to in expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased primarily due to leverage from the company s improvement in sales from its wholesale segment  including efficiencies gained by moving to a new west coast distribution center in march  offset by fixed costs de leveraging on its consumer direct segment s negative comparative stores sales base results 
interest and other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances and a higher rate of return on investments 
the company s effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of a temporary provision that allowed us companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate in  which resulted in approximately million in tax savings for the year ended december  this was offset by a tax benefit during of approximately  net of certain tax liabilities that were established  resulting from agreements reached with various taxing authorities that closed certain outstanding audit periods  for which the company had previously established reserves 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased by million  or  to million of net revenue  for the year ended december   from million of net revenue for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due to revenue increases in the company s wholesale and licensing business segments  partially offset by decreases in the company s consumer direct business 
wholesale net sales excluding sales to the consumer direct business segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in kenneth cole reaction ladies and children s footwear  and an approximate growth across its handbags businesses  as compared to december  this growth was offset by decreases of in kenneth cole new york men s and women s footwear  and in unlisted footwear categories 
in  the company accelerated its strategic initiative to reposition the kenneth cole new york brand as an accessible luxury brand and reduce the number of doors it was willing to distribute to 
the company believes that this transition is necessary to improve the company s wholesale net sales 
the company will continue to focus on improving product offerings  advertising campaigns  marketing efforts  website  catalogs and growing retail presence  combined with the marketing efforts of its licensees  which it believes will be significant factors in strengthening and defining all of its distinct brands  including kenneth cole reaction  tribeca  and bongo across all product classifications  thereby increasing consumer demand for these brands in the future 
net sales in the company s consumer direct segment decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in retail store sales of million  or  as compared to year ended december  comparable store sales decreased by million  or  offset by an increase of million of new store sales in plus the portion of sales for stores not open for all of the company believes the decrease in net sales in the consumer direct segment is primarily due to the company s repositioning of the kenneth cole new york brand in its retail stores  which was accelerated in the company believes well executed kenneth cole new york products will be embraced by its customers  as illustrated by the success of the kenneth cole new york handbags business 
however  some of the other products were not as well executed  and did not provide the consumer with the company s highest standard of price and value  and were not well received 
the company is focusing on the design  price and value of its kenneth cole new york products for in an effort to maintain  solidify  and build positive sales results  the company will continue to analyze inventory  focus on products and further scrutinize consumer trends  as well as concentrate on quality  style and price to continue customer acceptance of its brand repositioning strategy 
royalty revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily from incremental minimum royalties from the company s existing licensees  sales increases from fragrance and children s apparel  and its european licensee  offset by a reduction in minimum royalties from the transition of the women s sportswear licensee 
brand repositioning has slowed growth in  as a result of the company s strategic plan 
however  the company believes consumers look toward brands they know and feel are compatible with their lifestyles  therefore the synergies from its efforts to reinforce its brand identities through greater marketing efforts  by itself and its licensees across all product categories  will continue to strengthen and define its brands to improve name recognition allowing growth in sales both domestically and internationally throughout consolidated gross profit increased to in  as a percentage of net revenues  compared to in the increase was primarily a result of an improvement in consumer direct margins and the change in mix of the company s net revenues from its wholesale  consumer direct and licensing segments

at december   the company had no unrealized gains or losses as no forward contracts were outstanding 
unrealized gains and losses are typically included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statements of changes in shareholders equity and as an adjustment to inventory  which is the underlying exposure on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations are adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory from contract manufacturers in the far east and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent fluctuations of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company currently does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had no forward contracts outstanding 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its credit facilities 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates affecting the company s credit facilities would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income 
the company sources a significant amount of product from china and will be subject to foreign currency exposure to its us dollar denominated transactions if the chinese yuan is allowed to float freely on the open market 
if the yuan is allowed to float freely against other foreign currency  a two percent change in exchange rates could have a material effect on the company
