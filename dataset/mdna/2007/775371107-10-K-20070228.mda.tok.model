item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and we are a global specialty materials company that brings technology and innovation to the market to enhance the performance of end use consumer products made by our customers 
our products are sold primarily for use in the building and construction  electronics  packaging and paper  industrial and other  transportation  household and personal care  water and food markets 
our salt business has one of the most recognizable brand names in the world 
we operate six reportable segments coatings  monomers  performance chemicals  electronic materials  salt and adhesives and sealants 
a year in review represents another excellent year of performance for the company  resulting in record sales and earnings 
the results reflect the company s ability to operate in a dynamic world through superior execution of its business strategies 
significant items affecting the results of operations include the continued growth in our core businesses of electronic materials and coatings  the acceleration of growth in the emerging markets of china  india  central and eastern europe  turkey and latin america  the investment in new facilities to expand our global research  technical service and manufacturing footprint  the balanced deployment of cash for investment in growth initiatives  double digit dividend increase  stock repurchases and voluntary pension contributions  and  the implementation of a strategic plan that will accelerate profitable growth and provide greater shareholder value over the next several years 
in  we reported sales of  million  a increase over  with reported earnings from continuing operations in of million  or per share  as compared to earnings from continuing operations of million or per share  reflecting the impact of higher demand  higher pricing  and tighter cost controls 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements when the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
litigation and environmental reserves we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business involving employee  personal injury  property damage and environmental matters 
additionally  we are involved in environmental remediation and spend significant amounts for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to assess these matters to determine if a liability is probable  and record such a liability when the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated 
the determination and estimation of these liabilities are critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
in reviewing such matters  we consider a broad range of information  including the claims  demands  settlement offers received from governmental authorities or private parties  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute as well as our prior experience  to determine if a liability is probable and if the value is estimable 
if both of these conditions are met  we record a liability 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses  and disclose any material  reasonably possible  additional losses 
if we determine a liability to be only reasonably possible  we consider the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose any material potential liability 
our most significant reserves are those that have been established for remediation and restoration costs associated with environmental issues 
as of december   we have million reserved for environmental related costs 
we conduct studies and site surveys to determine the extent of environmental contamination and necessary remediation 
with the expertise of our environmental engineers and legal counsel  we determine our best estimates for remediation and restoration costs 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future costs for remediation and change periodically as additional and better information becomes available 
changes to assumptions and considerations used to calculate remediation reserves could materially affect our results of operations or financial position 
if we determine that the scope of remediation is broader than originally planned  discover new contamination  discover previously unknown sites or become subject to related personal injury or property damage claims  our estimates and assumptions could materially change 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate reserves for both our environmental and other legal liabilities are appropriate 
these estimates are based in large part on information currently available and the current laws and regulations governing these matters 
if additional information becomes available or there are changes to the laws or regulations or actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating our reserves  the resulting change could have a material impact on the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in the determination of our current year tax provision  we have accrued for deferred income taxes on income from foreign subsidiaries which have not been reinvested abroad permanently as upon remittance to the united states such earnings are taxable 
for foreign subsidiaries where earnings are permanently reinvested outside the united states  no accrual of additional united states income taxes has been provided 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit within these jurisdictions 
we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits 
we adjust these accruals  if necessary  upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 
since significant judgment is required to assess the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  the ultimate resolution of these events could result in adjustments to our financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
therefore  we consider such estimates to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the current year accrued and deferred tax positions are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
restructuring when appropriate  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our manufacturing footprint and support service functions 
to the extent that exact amounts are not determinable  we have established reserves for such initiatives by calculating our best estimate of employee termination costs utilizing detailed restructuring plans approved by management 
reserve calculations are based upon various factors including an employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary level and health care benefit choices 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to calculate these restructuring provisions are appropriate  and although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs could differ from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating reserves should changes be made in the nature or timing of our restructuring plans 
the resulting change could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings and equipment  long term investments  goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in addition  changes in the expected useful life of these long lived assets may also be an impairment indicator 
as a result  future decisions to change our manufacturing footprint or exit certain businesses could result in material impairment charges 
when such events or changes occur  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the assets use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that we must estimate include assumptions regarding sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic factors 
these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test for recoverability  we typically utilize discounted estimated future cash flows to measure fair value for each reporting unit 
this calculation is highly sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit and the discount rate assumed in these calculations 
these components are discussed below estimated future cash flows the key variables that we must estimate to determine future cash flows include assumptions for sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
for example  unanticipated changes in competition  customer sourcing requirements and product maturity would all have a significant impact on these estimates 
discount rate we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company  and therefore are beyond our control 
the average wacc utilized in our annual test of goodwill recoverability as of may   was  which was based upon average business enterprise value 
a increase in the wacc will result in an approximate decrease in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
a decrease in the wacc will result in an approximate increase in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
the following table summarizes the major factors that influenced the rate risk free rate of return cost of debt market risk premium the increase in risk free rate of return and cost of debt is due to the overall increase in us long term interest rates between the dates of our annual impairment testing as of may  and we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used in the above estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
a material adverse change in the estimated future cash flows for this business or increases in the wacc rate could result in the fair value falling below the book value of its net assets 
this could result in a material impairment charge 
the fair values of our long term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest  as well as the volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of these investment entities 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record impairment charges 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used to measure the plan obligations of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans  post retirement benefits  post employment benefits eg  medical  disability and other employee liabilities 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  the expected long term rate of return on assets  increases or trends in health care costs  and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
the discount rates for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans are determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation  discounting those expected payments using a zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds rated aa or better by moody s investor services as of the measurement date  and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that results in the same projected benefit obligation 
our calculation excludes bonds with explicit call schedules and bonds which are not frequently traded 
we use independent actuaries to assist us in determining the discount rate assumption and measuring our plans obligations 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our estimates of long term returns on major asset categories  such as fixed income and equity securities  and our actual allocation of pension investments among these asset classes 
in determining our long term expected rate of return  we take into account long term historical returns  historical performance of plan assets  the expected value of active investment management  and the expected interest rate environment 
we use a third party advisor to assist us in determining our investment strategy and forming our long term rate of return assumptions 
we believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate in the current economic environment 
however  if economic conditions change  we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions  and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the balance sheets 
at each measurement date  gains and losses from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions are calculated 
if this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in pension expense for the following year 
the weighted average discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the estimated return on plan assets used in our determination of plan obligations and pension expense are as follows weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation for years ended december  us us us us discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for years ended december  us us us us us us discount rate estimated return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the following illustrates the annual impact on pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the assumptions used to determine the net cost for the year ending december  combined weighted average estimated return on plan increase decrease discount rate assets pension expense in millions us us us us us non us basis point increase basis point decrease the following illustrates the annual impact on postretirement benefit expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the discount rate used to determine the net cost for the year ending december  weighted average discount rate in millions us us basis point increase basis point decrease share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimation of the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected dividends  and risk free interest rates 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
reportable segments at december  we operate six reportable segments  as presented below 
additional information regarding the markets these segments serve can be found in item business 
our sales and earnings by reportable operating segment and region are presented below 
net sales adhesives performance electronic and segment in millions coatings monomers chemicals materials salt sealants elims

total in millions net earnings from continuing operations coatings monomers performance chemicals electronic materials salt adhesives and sealants corporate total note the results for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to reflect automotive coatings as a discontinued operation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on october   we announced plans to reorganize our business beginning in january which will result in six different reportable segments 
our electronic materials and salt reportable segments remain unchanged 
the new reportable segments will now include primary materials  paint and coatings materials  packaging and building materials and performance materials 
primary materials will now include our existing monomers reportable segment and the polyacrylic acid business of consumer and industrial specialties 
paint and coatings materials will now include the architectural and industrial coatings business of our current coatings reportable segment  as well as other coatings related polymer lines from other parts of the rohm and haas portfolio 
packaging and building materials will now include the existing adhesives and sealants reportable segment  the plastics additives business  as well as the graphic arts  paper  leather  textile and non woven products of today s architectural and functional coatings business 
performance materials will now include the ion exchange and sodium borohydride technologies of the process chemicals business  the biocides and personal care related segments of the consumer and industrial specialties business  the agrofresh business  the powder coatings business of our current coatings reportable segment  and other niche technologies 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  through december  net sales and gross profits in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million over net sales of  million 
this increase was primarily driven by higher demand and selling prices across most of our businesses  partially offset by currency 
the key driver for the growth in sales was the strength of our electronics materials business with a full year sales increase of 
in addition  other parts of our portfolio also had strong full year sales results  with coatings up  performance chemicals up  and monomers up 
on a full year basis  salt was down  reflecting the effects of the lower ice control sales in the first and fourth quarters of as compared to in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million over net sales of  million 
this increase was primarily driven by higher selling prices with the impact of favorable foreign currencies offset by slightly lower demand 
from from sales change selling price currency demand volume other total change gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in  on higher sales 
gross profit margin in of remained relatively constant with as selling price increases virtually offset the impact of higher raw material and energy costs 
gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in  on higher sales 
gross profit margin increased in to from in due to higher selling prices necessary to offset higher raw material  operating and energy costs 
favorable currencies and product mix also helped margins 
in  we anticipate raw material and natural gas prices to remain flat in comparison to the high and volatile levels seen in to mitigate the impact of high and volatile raw material and energy costs  we have increased selling prices  and we are exercising control over discretionary spending  and utilizing swap  option and collar contracts 
for further information regarding the impact of raw materials on our businesses  please see raw materials on page selling and administrative expense in  selling and administrative expenses increased million or to  million from million in the increase largely reflects increased spending to support marketing and growth initiatives as well as the establishment of a european headquarters structure in lausanne  switzerland  which will be opening in mid in addition  effective september   our vacation policy changed for certain us employees 
this change resulted in a million decrease of which million  million and million related to selling and administrative expenses  costs of goods sold  and research and development expenses  respectively for the year ended december  in  selling and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million in primarily due to higher employee related costs  including a million pre tax adjustment to stock based compensation for retirement eligible employees where our plans provide for immediate vesting upon retirement  increased pension expense  normal salary increases and incentive compensation  and increasing health care costs 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of recent cost savings initiatives as well as a reduction in costs related to the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of of approximately million 
we believe that our cost savings initiatives will continue to reduce certain administrative costs as we improve efficiencies 
however  we anticipate overall higher employee related costs in as a result of normal salary increases  the increasing rate of health care costs  and increased share based compensation expense for restricted stock grants  primarily as a result of the increased amortization due to our adoption of sfas no 
in and the start of restricted stock grants to middle management in these increases will only partially be offset by lower pension costs  resulting from higher returns on plan assets  higher discount rates  and our and contributions 
research and development expense we spent million on research and development in  representing a increase from million in in  we spent million in research and development  a increase from million in the increases reflect higher employee related costs as well as new growth initiatives in the electronic materials  performance chemicals and coatings businesses 
interest expense interest expense for was million  representing a decrease from million in and a decrease from million in the primary reason for the decrease was due to lower levels of debt and a lower overall effective interest rate 
during  we retired the remaining million of our notes due in and billion of japanese yen denominated variable rate notes approximately million at september  
during  we retired million in us notes and exchanged million euro approximately million at december  in euro denominated notes for a more favorable effective interest rate and an extended term 
amortization of finite lived intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  virtually unchanged from the million in in  we recorded amortization for intangible assets of million  a decrease of from million in the decrease is due to a lower asset base as compared to prior years  resulting primarily from the impairments of certain finite lived intangible assets 
share of affiliate earnings  net in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  an increase from million in the increase was due to increased earnings from an equity affiliate in our electronic materials segment 
in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  a increase from million in the increase was primarily due to increased earnings from an equity affiliate in our electronic materials segment offset by decreased earnings from affiliates in the adhesives and sealants segment 
restructuring and asset impairments severance and employee benefits for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of expense for severance and associated employee benefits associated with the elimination of positions  primarily in our coatings and salt segments  concentrated in north america  and several north american support services functions 
our management approved restructuring initiatives to implement organizational alignments to support our vision strategy and to further improve the efficiency of our manufacturing network 
the organizational alignments include a more streamlined business structure  and deployment of resources to higher growth markets 
the restructuring charge also includes ongoing efficiency initiatives in north american chemical and salt businesses 
the staffing reductions relate to several of our manufacturing operations and are a direct result of changes in the execution of existing processes and productivity improvements  while support services staffing reductions are made possible as we continue to capitalize on the enhancements achieved through the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
this charge was offset by million of favorable adjustments to adequately reflect changes in estimates of remaining obligations related to severance payments within our global graphic arts business initiative announced in the first quarter of offsetting the net charge were favorable adjustments of million related to severance and employee benefits due to fewer employee separations than originally anticipated offset by million for lease contract obligations related to our initiatives 
the restructuring initiatives are expected to yield pre tax savings of million 
for the year ended december   our management approved restructuring initiatives to further improve the efficiency of our manufacturing network and support organization across several of our business segments 
the restructuring initiatives involve the closing or partial shutdown of manufacturing facilities in north america  the united kingdom and germany  in addition to a north american research and development facility 
included in the net million restructuring expense for are provisions for severance and employee benefits of million for employees company wide  impacting virtually all areas including sales and marketing  manufacturing  administrative support and research personnel 
included in the restructuring charge were provisions for contract and lease terminations totaling million 
offsetting the charge were favorable adjustments of million to reduce prior years restructuring reserves  primarily related to severance and employee benefits due to fewer employee separations than originally anticipated as some employees were re deployed and others filled positions left vacant through natural attrition 
the cost savings initiatives are expected to yield pre tax savings of approximately million annually 
for the year ended december   our management approved restructuring initiatives related to the reorganization of our plastics additives and architectural and functional coatings businesses and adhesives and sealants and electronic materials segments in north america and europe  which resulted in million of new restructuring charges and affected positions in total 
offsetting the charge were favorable adjustments of million to reduce prior year restructuring reserves 
included in the restructuring charge were provisions for contract and lease terminations totaling million 
the restructuring initiatives are expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
asset impairments for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of fixed asset impairment charges associated with the restructuring of our global graphic arts business within our coatings segment 
this charge was offset by million for sales of previously impaired assets 
for the year ended december   million of asset impairment charges were recognized for the impairment of certain finite lived intangible and fixed assets across several of our chemical businesses and our electronic materials segment 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total asset impairment charge by million 
of the total impairment charge  million pertained to the impairment of fixed assets  while million was an impairment charge recorded for certain finite lived intangible assets to adjust their carrying value to their fair value 
for the year ended december   we recorded asset impairment charges of million  which were primarily related to an administrative functions initiative 
other income  net in  net other income increased to million from million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of million partially offset by an increase in currency losses of million 
in  net other income increased to million from million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million from lower currency losses  and million of higher interest income 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in gains on disposal of real estate 
year over year increase in interest income is due to higher short term interest rates and increased average investments in money market funds 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million for the year ended december  reflecting an effective tax rate from continuing operations before minority interest of compared to the effective rate for earnings in in  our effective tax rate was 
benefits of the favorable resolution of tax contingencies  refund claims and tax law changes reduced tax expense by million 
during the second quarter of  we recorded net tax reserve and valuation allowance reversals of million resulting from the favorable resolution of prior period tax contingencies due to the completion of prior years tax audits 
in addition  we recorded changes in valuation allowances and increases in tax reserves for other contingencies 
the decreases in the effective tax rates year over year were primarily due to the impact of the changes described above as well as lower taxes on foreign earnings resulting from the increase in foreign tax credits and the permanent reinvestment of certain entities outside the us of foreign earnings  for which no us tax has been provided 
results of operations for the years ended december  through december  by business segment coatings in  net sales from our coatings segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in the sales increase was driven by higher selling prices and broad based growth  with continued penetration of emerging markets 
sales from architectural and functional coatings  which account for the majority of total coatings sales  increased over the prior year  reflecting higher selling prices and demand growth in all regions  led by growth in the emerging markets of china  india  turkey  eastern europe  southeast asia and latin america 
growth was strongest in the decorative coatings markets where we see strong acceptance of our differentiated low voc emulsion products for paint applications 
sales for powder coatings were up from  reflecting selling price increases and improved mix partially offset by lower demand  especially in europe 
earnings from continuing operations were million in versus prior year earnings of million 
earnings include million  after tax  in restructuring and asset impairment charges  compared to million  after tax  in restructuring and asset impairment charges in the prior year period 
the charges related primarily to the powder coatings business 
higher selling prices and favorable currencies in more than offset increases in raw material and operating costs  along with increases in selling and research costs to drive growth initiatives 
in  net sales from our coatings segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in the sales improvement was primarily driven by higher selling prices  with the favorable impact of currencies offset by lower demand 
sales from architectural and functional coatings  which account for approximately of total coatings sales  increased over the prior year  driven primarily by higher selling prices  a more favorable product mix  and favorable currencies  on flat demand 
strength in the north american decorative coatings market was offset by weakness in the european markets along with share losses globally in paper and graphic arts 
powder coatings sales decreased  primarily due to lower demand in europe  the result of softness in the marketplace and share loss 
demand for powder coatings in north america was down from the prior period reflecting the ongoing move of downstream customers to the asia pacific region 
this lower demand was only partially offset by improved pricing  the favorable impact of currency  and modest growth in asia 
earnings from continuing operations were million in versus prior year earnings of million 
results include million  after tax  in restructuring and asset impairment charges  primarily in the powder coatings business  compared to million  after tax  in restructuring charges in the prior year period 
higher selling prices  a more favorable product mix  and the favorable impact of currencies were substantially offset by higher raw material  manufacturing and energy costs  higher selling  administrative and research costs  and lower demand  as well as restructuring charges in the powder coatings business 
the results of the automotive coatings business  which were previously reported in the coatings segment  are now shown as a discontinued operation

monomers year ended december  in millions total sales elimination of inter segment sales third party sales in  net sales for monomers were  million  an increase of million  or  from prior year net sales of  million 
net sales for monomers include sales to our internal downstream monomer consuming businesses  primarily architectural and functional coatings  adhesives and sealants  and performance chemicals  along with sales to third party customers 
sales to external customers decreased to million in from million in the prior period  primarily due to lower volumes and lower selling prices 
sales to downstream rohm and haas specialty businesses were higher due primarily to higher selling prices and slightly higher volumes 
earnings from continuing operations of million in increased from million in the benefits of slightly higher volumes and improved plant operations more than offset the negative impact of lower selling prices to third party customers 
results included million  after tax  for expenses associated with unplanned plant outages at our deer park facility 
approximately of monomers earnings were generated on sales to our downstream businesses  as compared to in in  net sales for monomers were  million  an increase of million  or  from prior year net sales of  million 
sales to external customers increased to million in from million in the prior period 
the increase in sales can be attributed primarily to increased pricing implemented to offset the dramatic increase in raw material and energy costs  as well as the favorable impact of currencies 
earnings from continuing operations of million in increased from million in increased selling prices more than offset higher raw material  energy and plant operating costs  including million  after tax  for costs related to unexpected outages at our deer park  tx facility in the second and third quarters of these outages included the precautionary safety shutdown in anticipation of hurricane rita 
we anticipate that global monomer supply will increase again during as a result of new production facilities that have come on line 
we expect the supply dynamics to continue to create downward pressure on monomers pricing and margins in the upcoming year

sales in plastics additives increased from the prior period  driven by higher pricing in all regions and the favorable effect of currencies  partially offset by lower demand 
demand was down due to sluggish overall market conditions in europe  the flat to declining polyvinyl chloride industry both in north america and europe  as well as some share loss in lower margin products in eastern europe and asia as the business adjusted its portfolio of offerings 
net sales in consumer and industrial specialties increased  reflecting higher selling prices and the favorable impact of currencies on lower demand 
the lower demand is largely the result of portfolio adjustments affecting certain product lines  along with some share loss due to price increases 
sales in process chemicals increased  due to higher selling prices and a modest increase in overall demand 
continued strong demand for ion exchange resins in the industrial and water markets and increased demand for sodium borohydride in synthesis applications contributed to the volume growth 
earnings from continuing operations of million in were up from million in higher selling prices and the favorable impact of currencies were partially offset by higher raw material  energy and operating costs  along with increased selling  administrative and research spending

sales in advanced technology product lines were up versus the prior year 
sales for semiconductor technologies grew in  reflecting continued strength in sales of cmp pads and slurries in all regions along with strong sales of our advanced photoresists and related products both in asia pacific and north america 
the circuit board technologies business grew overall in  mainly driven by strength in the asia pacific region 
packaging and finishing technologies sales growth of was driven by both asia pacific and north america  with precious metal pass through sales up significantly due to higher raw material prices 
process sales grew year over year 
full year earnings of million were up significantly from the million earned in  reflecting increased sales of advanced technology products and continued discipline in cost management 
earnings include a million  after tax  gain from the reversal of restructuring reserves  earnings included million  after tax  for restructuring charges 
in  net sales from electronic materials of  million increased  or million  compared to prior year sales of  million 
the increase reflects improved demand in the semiconductor and related industries  especially in the third and fourth quarters  partially offset by normal price declines in our older product lines 
sales of advanced technology products  such as deep ultra violet photoresists  anti reflective coatings and chemical mechanical planarization pads and slurries  increased from the prior year 
sales in circuit board technologies were flat versus the prior period  as continued growth in asia pacific was offset by weaker market conditions in north america and europe

sales from packaging and finishing technologies increased from on growth in all regions  with precious metal pass through sales up significantly versus process sales grew year over year 
earnings of million in increased by compared to million in  primarily due to increased demand for advanced technology products and continued discipline in cost management throughout the business 
earnings include restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  after tax  compared to million in restructuring charges in  primarily related to the closure of a north american research and development facility in order to be closer to its customer base 
salt for the year  net sales from salt were million  a decrease of versus prior period net sales of million 
the decrease reflects a significant drop in ice control volumes in both the first and fourth quarters of as a result of mild weather conditions  which significantly lowered demand for highway de icing salt 
higher selling prices  favorable mix  and a favorable currency impact only partially offset the decline in ice control volume 
earnings for of million  which include million  after tax  in restructuring charges  have decreased by million compared to earnings of million in earnings were largely impacted by the unseasonably mild weather and the resulting reduction in ice control volumes 
increases in distribution  production and material costs during were partially offset by the impact of improved selling prices and favorable mix 
in  net sales for salt were million  an increase of  or million  over prior year net sales of million 
the increase was driven primarily by higher demand in ice control markets due to favorable winter weather in the first and fourth quarters  along with increased selling prices and the positive impact of currency 
earnings from continuing operations in were million  an increase of million compared to the million earned in the favorable impact of ice control volume gains and improved pricing more than offset higher production  distribution and energy costs  as well as the million  after tax  negative impact of hurricane rita 
adhesives and sealants in  net sales for adhesives and sealants were million  a decrease of  or million  from net sales of million in the decrease reflects the impacts of lower demand and slightly unfavorable currencies partially offset by higher pricing 
the overall lower demand reflects prior portfolio adjustments and slowing market growth in north america as the year progressed  along with lower demand for some acrylic products that benefited from a tight monomer supply environment in the prior year 
earnings of million  which include million  after tax  in restructuring charges  were up million versus earnings of million in the results included a charge of million  after tax  related to the impairment of the synthetic leather business and reserves for a plant closure in europe 
excluding the impairment charges for both periods  earnings increased by million  reflecting the impact of a one time legal settlement  higher selling prices and lower selling and administrative costs  partially offset by higher raw material and operating costs along with lower demand 
in  net sales for adhesives and sealants were million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of million in the increase reflects the impacts of higher pricing and favorable currencies  partially offset by lower demand 
the overall lower demand was largely the result of planned portfolio adjustments as we shed low margin business earlier in  along with the impact of our current pricing strategy 
earnings of million in decreased by million versus the million earned in the earnings decline is largely the result of million  after tax  in non cash asset impairment charges recorded in the second and third quarters of as well as million  after tax  in charges in the fourth quarter related to realignment of manufacturing operations in europe 
these charges tempered the business ongoing improvements in operating performance resulting from pricing to recover raw material and energy cost increases  effective portfolio adjustments  as well as a more efficient cost structure 
corporate for the year ended december   corporate after tax expenses were million  down from million in the change was primarily driven by lower interest expense  the absence of prior year charges for a loss on the early extinguishment of debt  an adjustment for share based compensation  lower environmental remediation charges  and higher interest income  partially offset by higher restructuring and shared service expenses  and the absence of favorable tax reserve and valuation allowance adjustments recognized in for the year ended december   corporate after tax expenses were million  consistent with million in the change was primarily driven by an adjustment to tax reserves and tax valuation allowances in conjunction with tax audit settlements  reduced restructuring and shared service expenses  higher interest income  and lower interest expense  all of which more than offset the costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt  an adjustment to share based compensation  higher environmental remediation charges  the absence of gains on the sale of the remaining interest in our european salt business  and lower insurance recoveries 
liquidity and capital resources overview one of our key financial policies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with debt levels well covered by our cash flows 
as of december   our company s debt ratio total debt in proportion to total debt plus stockholders equity was  down from as of december   and cash provided by operating activities exceeded of our year end debt cash from operating activities in proportion to total debt 
over the next several years  we expect to pursue growth strategies and provide cash returns to our stockholders without unduly stressing these ratios 
we intend to employ a balanced approach to cash deployment that will enhance stockholder value through reinvesting in core businesses to drive profitable growth through our capital expenditure program  investing in new platforms that address the growing needs in health  water  energy  and other areas in the developed and developing worlds  supplementing our organic growth with highly selective bolt on acquisitions which bring a growth platform technology or geographic supplement to our core businesses  continuing to pay higher cash dividends to our stockholders dividend payouts have increased at an average of compound annual growth rate since  and repurchasing shares to improve overall returns to our stockholders 
in the year ended december   our primary source of cash was from operating activities 
our principal uses of cash were reduction of debt  capital expenditures  dividends and stock repurchases 
these are summarized in the table below year ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities net long term debt reduction capital expenditures dividends stock repurchases stock option exercise proceeds our cash flow statement includes the combined results of our continued and discontinued operation for all periods presented 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities of million was lower than the million provided for the year ended december  increased net earnings were offset by an increase in year end inventory balances and federal and foreign income tax payments 
the three key drivers to the inventory increase were a decrease in sales of salt driven by lower demand for ice control salt due to the unreasonably warm weather  an increase in purchases of chemicals by our monomer and polymer businesses to take advantage of favorable propylene prices  coupled with a pronounced slow down in sales in the last days of december across many of our businesses 
the increase in federal and foreign income tax payments was due to the increase in pre tax income from continuing operations  tax payments related to the disposal of the automotive coatings business and a reduction in deferred tax expense 
approximately of cash provided by operating activities was generated during the second half of the year 
this is typical of our seasonality with cash from operating activities concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to working capital patterns in some of our core businesses  such as coatings and salt  as well as the timing of certain annual payments such as employee bonuses  interest on debt and property taxes  which have been concentrated in the first half of the year 
maintaining strong operating cash flow through earnings and working capital management continues to be an important objective 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan funding and liability our us erisa qualified pension plans represent approximately of our pension plan assets 
during  we increased the funding of our us pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans on a tax deductible basis by voluntarily contributing million to our us pension trust in november of this total  million was designated to fund pension benefits and the remaining million to fund retiree health care 
we also increased funding of our smaller international pension trusts 
total funding for international plans was approximately million in  over half of which was used to fund shortfalls in our canadian pension trust 
in  we contributed a total of approximately million to our qualified and non qualified pension plans as well as our postretirement healthcare plans 
we are not required to and therefore do not expect to make contributions to our us pension trust during we do expect to contribute million to fund both non us pension and other postretirement plans 
funding requirements for subsequent years are uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in assumptions used to calculate plan funding levels  the actual return on plan assets  changes in the employee groups covered by the plans  and any legislative or regulatory changes affecting plan funding requirements 
the company may increase  accelerate  decrease or delay contributions to the plans to the extent permitted by law 
the overall funded status of the pension plans improved significantly during as the us plans moved from an unfunded status of to a surplus of million 
the improvement in our us funded level is due to the positive impact of a higher discount rate on projected benefit obligation  coupled with growth in asset base due to higher investment returns and the million contribution made in november the unfunded status of the non us plans decreased from million to million 
this improvement in our non us funded level was primarily attributable to the impact of a higher discount rate on the plans projected benefit obligation and higher plan asset values due to increased employer contributions 
qualified pension expense remained consistent at million for and  despite the favorable effect of growth in asset levels  as the higher amortization of plan losses attributable to unrecognized losses in offset these asset driven gains 
the unrecognized gain for will reduce the unrecognized loss being amortized over the average expected future working lifetime of active participants 
as of december   the average expected future working lifetime of active plan participants varies by plan and ranged from to years 
actual results for will depend on the actuarial valuation of the plan 
capital expenditures we manage our capital expenditures to take advantage of growth and productivity improvement opportunities as well as to fund ongoing environmental protection and plant infrastructure requirements 
we have a well defined review procedure for the authorization of capital projects 
capital expenditures in were higher than prior year expenditures due to several large projects  including projects in the emerging markets  primarily china and taiwan 
significant capital additions include completion of the new research and development center in shanghai  china  opening of the new cmp research and manufacturing center in taiwan  a project in our louisville  kentucky plant to meet new environmental requirements  expansions in our qingpu  china and weeks island  louisiana plants to increase capacity  construction of new manufacturing facilities in queratero  mexico and chennai  india 
both facilities will be completed in construction of a new research and development center in shanghai  china which was completed in  capacity initiatives within the north american emulsion manufacturing locations  process control systems at our knoxville  tennessee facility  and volatile organic compound reduction and quality capacity improvements at our chauny  france facility 
process control systems at our knoxville  tennessee and lauterbourg  france plants  security systems in many of our north american region plants  powder coatings facility in china  and purchase of bulk shipping terminal assets at our bristol  pennsylvania and la mirada  california sites 
expenditures for the past three years  categorized by primary purpose of project  are presented below in millions cost savings and infrastructure capacity additions and new products erp infrastructure research facilities and equipment capitalized interest cost total spending for environmental protection equipment included in several of the categories in the table shown above  was million in  million in and million in projected capital expenditures in of approximately million are expected to be in line with depreciation expense 
dividends common stock dividends have been paid each year since the payout has increased at an average of compound annual growth rate since dividend paid amount year per common share in millions line graph share repurchase program in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
during  we used million of available cash to repurchase million of our outstanding shares 
as of december   we had repurchased million of our stock or million shares under the current authorization 
liquidity and debt as of december   we had million in cash  including restricted cash  and  million in debt compared with million and  million  respectively  at december  a summary of our cash and debt balances is provided below december  december  in millions short term obligations long term debt total debt cash and cash equivalents restricted cash total debt during  we completed the early retirement of the remaining million of notes scheduled to mature on july  the retirement  which was completed in three stages beginning in march  resulted in a loss of million in and an immaterial gain in in september of  we retired billion of yen denominated variable rate notes approximately million 
at december   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our short term debt is primarily composed of local bank borrowings and the current portion of long term debt for our euro denominated notes due in march during  our primary source of short term liquidity has been cash from operating activities 
we expect this to continue with commercial paper and bank borrowings needed to support local working capital needs from time to time 
in december  we extended the term of our million revolving credit facility with a syndicated group of banks 
this facility is committed until december and is not contingent upon our credit rating 
as of december   we have not drawn down any funds against this facility 
moody s and standard and poor s currently rate our senior unsecured long term debt a and a minus  respectively  with stable outlooks  and our short term commercial paper  p and a  respectively 
in general  we believe these ratings are consistent with the objectives of our long term financial policies 
use of derivative instruments to manage market risk we use derivative instruments to reduce volatility arising from conducting our business in a variety of currencies  financing at long and short term interest rates and pricing our raw materials at market prices 
during the year ended december   million net cash was expended and million in losses were realized from derivative instruments 
as of december   the fair market value of all derivative contracts was a net million after tax liability compared with a net million after tax asset at december  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table provides contractual obligations and commitments for future payments in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years over years long term debt  including current portion interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations  pension and other employee benefit funding esop loan guarantees interest on esop loan guarantees total contractual cash obligations notes for our requirements contracts  we have assumed that our existing business segments will require materials and services generally consistent with prior years 
the amount of the obligation is based upon either projected requirements or historical spend 
our purchase obligations include raw materials  indirect materials  traffic and logistics  utilities and energy  information technology and communications contracts 
these obligations include evergreen contracts that renew automatically until specifically cancelled by either party 
we have assumed that our evergreen contracts will continue through forecasting qualified pension plan contributions requires the usage of certain assumptions such as interest rates used to calculate plan liabilities  demographic assumptions used to determine changes in participation  and rates of return on assets  therefore  we feel it is appropriate to only forecast out years due to the uncertainties of the future assumptions 
the non qualified plan and other employee benefits reflect expected future benefit payments  which are forecasted out through see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
as of december   we had repurchased million of our stock or million shares under the current authorization 
trading activities we do not have any trading activity that involves non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
unconsolidated entities all significant entities are consolidated 
any unconsolidated entities are de minimis in nature and there are no significant contractual requirements to fund losses of unconsolidated entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our treatment of variable interest entities 
environmental matters and litigation our chemical operations  as those of other chemical manufacturers  involve the use and disposal of substances regulated under environmental protection laws 
our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the risk of harm to the environment 
the company has participated in the remediation of waste disposal and manufacturing sites as required under the superfund and related laws 
remediation is well underway or has been completed at many sites 
nevertheless  the company continues to face government enforcement actions  as well as private actions  related to past manufacturing and disposal and continues to focus on achieving cost effective remediation where required 
accruals we have provided for costs to remediate former manufacturing and waste disposal sites  including superfund sites  as well as our company facilities 
we consider a broad range of information when we determine the amount necessary for remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for these or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other potentially responsible parties prps to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
reserves for environmental remediation that we believe to be probable and estimable are recorded appropriately as current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the accruals quarterly and update them as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  we are unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of our responsibility for study and remediation costs 
the amounts charged to pre tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included in cost of goods sold and are presented below in millions balance december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  wood ridge berry s creek the wood ridge  new jersey site site  and berry s creek  which runs past this site  are areas of environmental significance to the company 
the site is the location of a former mercury processing plant acquired many years ago by a company later acquired by morton international  inc morton 
morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation of the site 
the new jersey department of environmental protection issued the record of decision documenting the clean up requirements for the manufacturing site in october the company has submitted a work plan to implement the remediation  and will enter into an agreement or order to perform the work in early our exposure at the site will depend on clean up costs and on the results of efforts to obtain contributions from others 
velsicol s liabilities for site response costs will be addressed through a bankruptcy trust fund established under a court approved settlement with velsicol  and other parties  including the government 
with regard to berry s creek  and the surrounding wetlands  the epa has issued letters to over prps for performance of a broad scope investigation of risks posed by contamination in berry s creek 
performance of this study is expected to take at least six years to complete 
the prps are in the process of forming a representative group to negotiate with the epa 
today  there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek  but investigation and cleanup costs  as well as potential resource damage assessments  could be very high and our share of these costs could possibly be material to the results of our operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
other environmental expenditures the laws and regulations under which we operate require significant expenditures for capital improvements  operation of environmental protection equipment  environmental compliance and remediation 
our major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make unforeseen additional environmental expenditures 
capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
spending for and is expected to approximate million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental projects intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
the cost of managing  operating and maintaining current pollution abatement facilities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was charged against each year s earnings 
climate change there is an increasing global focus on issues related to climate change and particularly on ways to limit and control the emission of greenhouse gases  which are believed to be associated with climate change 
some initiatives on these topics are already well along in europe  canada and other countries  and related legislation has passed or is being introduced in some us states 
the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change was adopted in in many countries 
for instance  the european union has a mandatory emissions trading scheme to implement its objectives under the kyoto protocol 
four of our european locations currently exceed the threshold for participation in the eu emissions trading scheme pursuant to the kyoto protocol and are currently implementing the requirements established by their respective countries 
we are very much aware of the importance of these issues and the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions 
due to the nature of our business  we have emissions of carbon dioxide co  primarily from combustion sources  although we also have some minor process by product co emissions 
our emissions of other greenhouse gases are infrequent and minimal as compared to co emissions 
we have therefore focused on ways to increase energy efficiency and curb increases in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from growth in production in addition to lowering the energy usage of existing operations 
although the general lack of specific legislation prevents any accurate estimates of the long term impact on the company  any legislation that limits co emissions may create a potential restriction to business growth by capping consumption of traditional energy sources available to all consumers of energy  including rohm and haas 
capping consumption could result in increased energy cost  additional capital investment to lower energy intensity and rationed usage with the need to purchase greenhouse gas emission credits 
we will continue to follow these climate change issues  work to improve the energy efficiencies of our operations  work to minimize any negative impacts on company operations and seek technological breakthroughs in energy supply and efficiency 
litigation we are involved in various kinds of litigation  principally in the united states 
we strive to resolve litigation where we can through negotiation and other alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation 
otherwise  we vigorously defend lawsuits in the courts 
significant litigation is described in note to the consolidated financial statements  but we will comment here on several recent legal matters 
in november  a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky by individuals alleging that their persons or properties were invaded by particulate and air contaminants from our louisville plant 
the complaint seeks class action certification alleging that there are hundreds of potential plaintiffs residing in neighborhoods within two miles of the plant 
we have not yet been served with the complaint 
in april and thereafter  lawsuits were filed against rohm and haas claiming that the company s ringwood  illinois plant contaminated groundwater and air that allegedly reached properties a mile south of the plant site 
also sued were the owner of a plant site neighboring our facility and a company which leases a portion of our facility 
an action brought in federal court in philadelphia  pennsylvania seeks certification of a class comprised of the owners and residents of about homes in mccullom lake village  seeking medical monitoring and compensation for alleged property value diminution  among other things 
in addition  lawsuits were filed in the philadelphia court of common pleas by sixteen individuals who claim that contamination from the plants has resulted in cancer primarily of the brain 
we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to defend them vigorously 
rohm and haas  minnesota mining and manufacturing company m and hercules  inc have been engaged in remediation of the woodland sites sites  two waste disposal locations in the new jersey pinelands  under various njdep orders since the early s 
remediation is complete at one site and substantially complete at the other 
in february  a lawsuit was filed in state court in burlington county  new jersey by njdep and the administrator of the new jersey spill compensation fund against these three companies and others for alleged natural resource damages relating to the sites 
in june  after the lawsuit was served  the defendants filed a notice of removal of the action to the federal court in camden  new jersey 
this lawsuit presents significant legal and public policy issues  including the fundamental issue of whether there are any damages  and the company intends to defend it vigorously 
in late january  morton salt was served with a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the department of justice into possible antitrust law violations in the industrial salt business 
neither morton salt  nor any morton salt employee has been charged with any wrongdoing 
we are cooperating fully with the governmental investigation 
acquisitions and divestitures significant acquisitions and divestitures are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
working capital for  working capital increased by days as compared to there were three key drivers of this increase 
first  there was inventory build up in salt driven by low demand for salt for ice control due to abnormally mild weather 
second  we chose to build up inventory with the monomer and polymer businesses to take advantage of below trend line propylene prices 
finally  in late december  we saw a pronounced slowdown in shipments across many of our businesses  to levels well below our forecasts  that further added to inventories 
details about two major components of working capital at the end of and are summarized below millions inventories year end balance annual turnover x x days cost of sales in ending inventory customer receivables  net year end balance annual turnover x x days sales outstanding notes days sales outstanding were calculated by dividing ending net customer receivables by daily sales for the fourth quarter 
days cost of sales in ending inventory was calculated by dividing ending inventory by daily cost of sales for the fourth quarter 
for customer receivables  annual turnover figures are calculated by dividing annual sales by the average customer receivables balance

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since we denominate our business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finance our operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchase raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
our operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments for which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting the amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet was a net liability of million pre tax 
all of these contracts were with investment grade financial institutions 
we enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analyses quantify the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period  most commonly within a one year period 
the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 
foreign exchange rate risk our products are manufactured and sold in a number of locations around the world 
we generate revenues and incur costs in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  we finance operations outside of the united states in local currencies 
our diverse base of local currency costs  financings  and foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts will partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on revenues  earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
nevertheless  when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
known and anticipated exposures are covered by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures are related to our operations in germany  france  italy  the netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden  switzerland  brazil  mexico  canada  japan  taiwan  china and australia 
we estimate that an instantaneous depreciation in all the currencies of these countries from their levels against the dollar as of december   with all other variables held constant  would increase the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  by million  a appreciation of these currencies would decrease the fair market value by million 
this estimate is based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of short and long term debt by million  net of derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on our earnings per share or cash flows as the majority of our debt obligations at december  consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of the weighted average rate on our worldwide debt 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material and energy prices have had material impacts on our earnings and cash flows in the past  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
commodity derivative instruments are used to reduce portions of commodity price risks 
a increase in the underlying commodity price would increase the fair value of commodity derivative instruments by million 
a decrease in the underlying commodity price would decrease the fair value of commodity derivative instruments by million
