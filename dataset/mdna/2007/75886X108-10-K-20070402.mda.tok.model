results of operations 
as a company focused on the research and clinical development efforts necessary to bring pharmaceutical products to the market  our operations are currently generating losses 
those losses are generally the net result of research and development efforts  and general and administrative costs  offset by investment income 
additionally  in we received income of approximately  from a grant awarded by the fda s office of orphan drugs and we anticipate a similar amount of grant income in this income helps to offset some of the costs we incur for our epidermolysis bullosa trial 
these annual net losses have increased from million in to million in and million in we anticipate our net losses will increase in the near term as we continue to expand and advance our clinical development activity 
for the three years ended december   we reported annually increasing expenditures in the area of research and development 
these increases directly reflect the increased research and development activities that we have undertaken as our clinical development has progressed over the three year period 
in we were focused primarily on pre clinical and phase i clinical activities in our dermal wound healing indications 
during  some of these preclinical activities continued into the first half of the year  clinical drug formulation was performed  and phase ii clinical trials commenced in the later half of the year 
during we continued to manage our phase ii clinical dermal trials and expanded our clinical development program into the cardiac and ophthalmic areas 
specifically  drug formulation  protocol development  contractor and site qualification  etc  were commenced during for our planned myocardial infarction and ophthalmic wound healing trials 
to manage these expanding research efforts  we increased our research staffing from one and a half full time equivalent employees in to full time equivalent employees by the end of coincident with our expanding development was the need to supply increasingly larger amounts of t  along with a significant increase in outsourced contract activity 
all of these expanding efforts increased our research and development costs from million in to million in and million in  approximately a three fold increase 
included in these total research and development costs were non cash equity compensation costs for our research and development personnel of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see note to the financial statements for a full description of our accounting for the costs of non cash equity compensation and how that accounting has changed during this time period 
general and administrative expenses include legal costs to protect our patent portfolio  non cash equity compensation of our administrative personnel  along with the general compliance and administrative costs necessary to operate a publicly traded entity 
in  we had two full time administrative employees 
during  we hired a chief financial officer which increased our administrative headcount to three 
additionally  in we were listed on the american stock exchange and generally enhanced our supporting infrastructure to accommodate all of our additional employees and expanded research activities 
as a result  general and administrative costs increased from million in to million in and to million in included in those costs were patent legal costs of approximately million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
non cash equity compensation expenses for our administrative personnel were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
with the exception of some additional costs to comply with section requirements of sarbanes oxley  which we do not believe will be material  and additional non cash equity compensation costs  we do not anticipate a significant change in our current level of general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources 
since inception we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities 
at december  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
although no assurance can be given  we believe that our current cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our operating needs through the second quarter of however  those activities will not be sufficient to bring our drug candidates to market and we  therefore  believe new capital resources will be required in the coming months to continue our independent development efforts 
accordingly  we may entertain the possibility of raising additional capital to preserve our liquidity  depending on a number of conditions  including conditions in the capital markets 
we regularly consider the conditions of capital markets  dilution  stockholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing 
certain of the financing options available to us may have negative consequences to stockholders such as dilution 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a negative consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to stockholders 
contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations as of december   presented in the following chart consist of an office facility lease which ends in january and obligations to purchase t we anticipate that a new lease will be more expensive than our current lease due to an increased rate per square foot and possibly leasing additional square feet 
while we can not accurately predict these future expenses at this time  we do not anticipate that the increased costs will be material to our future operating results 
payments due by period total under year years operating lease purchase obligations we also have approximately million in other contractual obligations due within one year and related to our research and development efforts 
these obligations  however  are contingent on future events  eg the rate of patient accrual in our clinical trials 
this amount represents the remaining contractual amounts due under various contracts  although all of these contracts could be cancelled by us  in which case we would only be liable to the vendors for work performed to the date of cancellation 
critical accounting policies 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows share based payment effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted to employees after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with statement no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of statement no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to statement no 
r adoption  we accounted for share based payments to employees under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
since our historical data is limited  the expected life was determined in accordance with sab guidance for plain vanilla options 
since our historical trading volume is relatively low  we estimated the expected volatility based on monthly closing prices for a period consistent with the expected life of the option 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation and the relative ranges of our historical  underlying assumptions 
clinical trial costs we accrue estimated costs for clinical studies conducted by contract research organizations and participating hospitals 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up hospital sites for participation in trials are accrued immediately 
hospital costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable securities  which are composed primarily of investment grade corporate bonds  us government agency debt securities and mortgage and asset backed securities  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
due to the short term nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in fair value would not be material
