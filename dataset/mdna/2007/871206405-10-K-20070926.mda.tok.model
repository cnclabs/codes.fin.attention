executive summary we develop and market intelligent bandwidth management solutions for fixed line and mobile network operators worldwide and provide services associated with such products 
our current and prospective customers include domestic and international wireline and wireless network service providers  utility companies  multiple systems operators msos and government entities with private fiber networks collectively referred to as service providers 
our comprehensive portfolio of optical switches  multiservice access platforms  and industry leading networking software extends across the network  from multiservice access and regional backhaul to the optical core 
we believe that our products enable network operators to efficiently and cost effectively provision and manage multiservice access and optical network capacity to support a wide range of converged services such as voice  video and data 
on september   we acquired eastern research  inc  a provider of network access multiservice switching solutions for fixed line and mobile network operators worldwide for a total purchase price of approximately million 
eastern research s customers include fixed line service providers  wireless carriers  utility companies  and government agencies 
we believe that the addition of eastern research s products  technology and talent positions us to diversify and increase our customer base  expand our addressable markets  and broaden our customer offerings 
total revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of compared to fiscal our net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income for fiscal of million 
the net loss for fiscal includes acquisition related charges of million for in process research and development and asset impairment charges of million 
eastern research s ox product was in the development stage on the date of acquisition and accordingly we recorded in process research and development expense of million on the date of the acquisition 
in fiscal  the company decided to discontinue the development of eastern research s ox and bsg products 
as a result of the company s decision to discontinue the ox and bsg products  we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
we continue to maintain a significant cost structure  relative to our revenue  particularly within the research and development organization 
we believe that these investments have enabled us to advance our technology and secure new business 
as we remain focused on improvements in our business  our management and board of directors will continue to consider strategic options that may serve to maximize shareholder value 
these options include acquiring or making strategic investments in companies with either complementary technologies or in adjacent markets to add complementary products and services  expand the markets we serve and diversify our customer base 

table of contents our total cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at july  included in this amount were cash and cash equivalents of million 
we intend to fund our operations  including fixed commitments under operating leases  and any required capital expenditures over the next few years using our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe that  based on our business plans and current conditions  our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we also believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will enable us to pursue the strategic options discussed above 
as of july   sycamore and its subsidiaries employed approximately persons  which was a net increase of persons from the approximately persons employed on july  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those relating to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventory allowance  litigation and other contingencies  intangible assets and goodwill and share based compensation expense 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates can affect materially the amount of our reported net income or loss 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
through our acquisition of eastern research  we acquired network management software that increases network management efficiencies and can be integrated with certain of our communications networking equipment 
accordingly  on transactions involving this software  we account for revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  and all related interpretations 
sop includes criteria similar to sab however  collectibility must be probable rather than reasonably assured 
for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets  except as otherwise covered by sop  the determination as to how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate deliverables of the arrangement is determined in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective 
table of contents element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if fair value does not exist for any undelivered element  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of i the undelivered element is delivered or ii fair value of the undelivered element exists  unless the undelivered element is a service  in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts 
in the event that we become aware of deterioration in a particular customer s financial condition  a review is performed to determine if additional provisions for doubtful accounts are required 
warranty obligations we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
an increase in the warranty accrual will have an adverse impact on our gross margin 
inventory allowance we continuously monitor inventory balances and record inventory allowances for any excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand  manufacturing quantities and market conditions 
while such assumptions may change from period to period  we measure the net realizable value of inventories using the best information available as of the balance sheet date 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional inventory allowances may be required 
once we have written down inventory to its estimated net realizable value  we cannot increase its carrying value due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
accordingly  if inventory previously written down to its net realizable value is subsequently sold  we may realize improved gross profit margins on these transactions 
reserve for contingencies we are subject to various claims  litigation and other disputes  as well as potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims  litigation and other disputes and potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
the company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts 
goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively  at july  estimates of future cash flows require 
table of contents assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
share based compensation expense the company accounts for share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we have estimated the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
results of operations fiscal years ended july  and revenue the following table presents product and service revenue in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent revenue product service total revenue total revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to an increase in both product revenue and service revenue 
product revenue consists primarily of sales of our intelligent bandwidth management solutions 
our multiservice access products  acquired on september  through the acquisition of eastern research  contributed approximately million to product revenue for fiscal product revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a higher level of orders from our existing customers to increase the capacity of their networks and the revenue contribution from our newly acquired multiservice access products 
service revenue consists primarily of fees for services relating to the maintenance of our products  installation services and training 
service revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to service revenue from our newly acquired multiservice access business and a higher base of maintenance renewal contracts 
for fiscal  two customers accounted for and of revenue or of our total revenue 
three customers accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal or of our total revenue 
international revenue represented of revenue in fiscal  compared to of revenue in fiscal we expect future revenue to continue to be highly concentrated in a relatively small number of customers and that international revenue may represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
customer deployments in any given quarter may cause significant shifts in the percentage mix of domestic and international revenue 
the loss of any one of these customers or any substantial reduction in orders by any one of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents gross profit the following table presents gross profit for product and services  including non cash share based compensation expense in thousands  except percentages year ended july  gross profit product service total gross profit product service total product gross profit cost of product revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers for purchased materials and services and other fixed manufacturing costs 
product gross profit percentage decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of a million purchase accounting step up charge related to acquired inventory  a million charge related to inventory of eastern research s ox and bsg products which the company decided to discontinue  unfavorable product and customer mix  partially offset by higher margins from our newly acquired multiservice access business 
in the future  we believe that product gross profit may fluctuate due to pricing pressures resulting from intense competition in our industry as well as the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers 
in addition  product gross profit may be affected by changes in the mix of products sold  channels of distribution  shipment volume  overhead absorption  sales discounts  increases in labor costs  excess inventory and obsolescence charges  increases in component pricing or other material costs  the introduction of new products or the entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 
service gross profit cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs of providing services under customer service contracts which include salaries and related expenses and other fixed costs 
service gross profit increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased maintenance revenues 
as most of our service cost of revenue is fixed  increases or decreases in revenue will have a significant impact on service gross profit 
service gross profit may be affected in future periods by various factors including  but not limited to  the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services  competitive and economic pricing pressures  the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers  and maintenance renewals and timing of renewals

sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses  customer evaluations inventory and other sales and marketing support expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of eastern research  which contributed additional sales and marketing expenses and the costs associated with an employment agreement between the company and the company s former vice president of worldwide sales and support and a resulting charge arising from the modification of his stock option agreement which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal within our existing spend levels  we continue to reallocate sales and marketing resources to those geographic regions where we see the most attractive opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to costs of approximately million associated with the audit committee s independent stock option investigation  million of amortization expense related to purchased intangibles and the acquisition of eastern research  which contributed additional general and administrative expenses 
asset impairments the company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company decided to discontinue the development of eastern research s ox product 
this product was in the development stage on the date of acquisition and accordingly we recorded in process research and development expense of million on the 
table of contents date of the acquisition 
as a result of the company s decision to discontinue the ox product  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal the charge related to certain tangible and intangibles assets associated with the ox product  specifically customer relationships and other related fixed assets

in addition  the company recorded a charge of million related to bsg inventory in cost of product revenue 
in process research and development in process research and development of million was written off in the first quarter of fiscal and related to a project under development for which technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses for the technology existed at the time of acquisition 
the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow model  based on a discount rate which took into consideration the stage of completion and risks associated with developing the technology 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its workforce by employees to better align development resources with future growth opportunities  further improve operational efficiencies  and capitalize on additional acquisition synergies 
as a result of these actions  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million that was comprised primarily of expenses related to the workforce reduction  which will be substantially paid by the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the company expects to incur charges in the first half of fiscal related to facility consolidations 
reserve for contingencies during the third quarter of fiscal  the company accrued million associated with contingencies related to claims  litigation and other disputes  as well as potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company increased this accrual by million 
based on ongoing negotiations and settlement discussions  the company decreased this accrual by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 a liability is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company reviews the need for any such provision on a quarterly basis and records any necessary adjustments to reflect the effect of ongoing negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case in the period they become known 
we are also subject to tax audits by various tax authorities 
management has recorded its best estimate of the probable liability resulting from these audits as of july  while we believe that the amounts accrued are adequate  any subsequent change in our estimates will be recorded at such time the change is probable and estimable 
interest and other income  net the following table presents interest and other income  net in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent interest and other income  net

income tax expense income tax expense of million was recorded in fiscal for alternative minimum tax and taxes due on income generated in foreign tax jurisdictions and certain states 
we did not record any net tax benefits relating to our net losses due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these future tax benefits 
as a result of incurring substantial net operating losses from through  the company determined that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets may not be realized 
therefore  in accordance with the requirements of fasb  the company maintains a full valuation allowance 
if the company generates sustained future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed 
if the valuation allowance were reversed  a portion would be recorded as an increase to paid in capital and the remainder would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense
