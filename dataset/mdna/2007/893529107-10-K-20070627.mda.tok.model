overview operational overview 
we are a leading distributor of professional grade test  measurement  and calibration equipment and provider of nationally recognized and accredited calibration and repair services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our distribution products segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test  measurement and calibration equipment 
additionally  because we specialize in test  measurement and calibration equipment  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to assist them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
our sales in our distribution products segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as industrial customers increase or curtail capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
the majority of our products are not consumables but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
our strength in our calibration services segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration and repair of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
we believe our calibration services segment offers long term growth opportunity and the potential for continuing sales from established customers from what is typically an annual calibration cycle 
we evaluate sales growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  and not by analyzing any single quarter 

table of contents financial overview 
in evaluating the company s results for fiscal year and the fiscal year fourth quarter  the following factors should be taken into account fiscal year and the fiscal year fourth quarter operating results include weeks and weeks  respectively  compared to weeks and weeks for the corresponding periods for fiscal year the fiscal year operating results include the recognition of a previously deferred pre tax gain of million from the sale of tpg to fluke 
although the sale of tpg occurred in fiscal year  transcat had entered into a distribution agreement in connection with the transaction and was precluded from recognizing the gain at that time because the distribution agreement required us to purchase a pre determined amount of inventory during each calendar year from to in december  transcat s purchases exceeded the required amount for calendar year  as they had in each of the prior four years  which fulfilled the obligation and triggered the recognition of the gain in the fiscal year third quarter 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the expensing of stock awards  at the beginning of fiscal year approximately million of stock expense was recorded in fiscal year there was no stock expense recorded in fiscal year net income for fiscal year and the fiscal year fourth quarter includes income tax provisions of million and million  respectively 
approximately million of the full year amount relates to the gain on the sale of tpg 
the results for fiscal year and the fiscal year fourth quarter included a benefit from income taxes of million that resulted from the reversal of a large portion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the end of fiscal year s fourth quarter marked eight consecutive quarters of year over year quarterly net sales growth in both our product distribution and calibration services segments 
taking the additional week in fiscal year into account  our overall product growth rate of calculated on dollars in thousands was in line with our expectations for the year 
during fiscal year  we experienced growth within our indirect channel 
our direct channel continued to grow  with year over year sales growth of 
calibration services sales grew by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year calculated on dollars in thousands 
our overall gross margin  as a percent of sales  was relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year 
on a segment basis  our distribution products gross margin ratio improved by points  driven primarily by increased vendor rebates and continued focus on controlling promotional pricing  offset to a degree by increased sales to indirect markets which generated lower margins 
in our calibration services segment  gross margin declined points due to the rate of investment in lab operating expenses exceeding the rate of growth in sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting principles or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of our consolidated financial statements includes a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our most critical accounting policies follows use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of fixed assets  estimated lives of our master catalog  and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our 
table of contents accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to sales over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of sales and or the historical rate of returns 
inventory 
inventory consists of products purchased for resale and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost by applying a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 
property and equipment  depreciation  and amortization 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization is computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements property and equipment determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we account for software costs in accordance with statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  using the fair market value measurement requirement  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach 
we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
the evaluation of our reporting units on a fair value basis indicated that no impairment existed as of march   march  and march  catalog costs 
we capitalize the cost of each master catalog mailed and amortize the cost over the respective catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total unamortized catalog costs in prepaid expenses and deferred charges on the consolidated balance sheets were million as of march  and march  deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
see taxes below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents stock based compensation 
effective march   we adopted sfas r  which requires us to measure the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted  including stock options and warrants  based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date 
sfas r supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method which requires us to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of march  by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings 
awards granted after march  will be valued at fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award 
sfas r also requires excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock awards to be presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity  as presented prior to the adoption of sfas r 
excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock based compensation costs for such awards 
we did not have any stock based compensation costs capitalized as part of an asset 
we estimated forfeiture rates for fiscal year based on our historical experience 
prior to fiscal year  we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with apb  using the intrinsic value method  which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for our stock awards provided the exercise price was equal to or greater than the common stock fair market value on the date of grant 
prior to fiscal year  we provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  as if the fair value method defined in sfas had been applied to its stock based compensation 
our net income and net income per share for the fiscal years and would have been reduced if compensation cost related to stock awards had been recorded in the financial statements based on fair value at the grant dates 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for our disclosure regarding the effects of sfas r 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers  as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations 
our prices are fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and returns are reasonably estimated 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
we recognize the majority of our service revenues based upon when the calibration or repair activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
our shipments are generally free on board shipping point and our customers are generally invoiced for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
gain on tpg divestiture 
during the fiscal year ended march   we sold tpg 
as a result of certain post closing commitments  we deferred recognition of a million gain on the sale 
during fiscal year  we satisfied those commitments and consequently realized the gain as a component of operating income in our consolidated financial statements

fin in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this interpretation on our consolidated financial statements 
sab in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when qualifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which became effective for years ending on or before november  sab requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
the implementation of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedging accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook as we enter fiscal year  we are well positioned to continue our growth in both the distribution products and calibration services segments through focused efforts that leverage our investments and the identification of opportunities consistent with our existing product and service segments 
we expect the business should experience growth in both business segments  assuming a stable economy 
one thing to consider  particularly when evaluating fiscal year fourth quarter performance  will be a return to a week fiscal year  compared to the week fiscal year in sales growth in any individual quarter is effected by a number of factors  some beyond our control and others that we can plan for  as described in item a of this report 
we have seen positive results from the operational changes we made in our sales processes and organization during the second half of fiscal year in fiscal year  we anticipate a continued  positive response to these changes 
with these changes in place  we will continue focusing on growth in our calibration services business in order to leverage the investments we have made and improve our gross margin and operating cash flow 
within our distribution products segment  we will place continued emphasis on sales efforts in our more profitable direct channels 
at the same time  we anticipate sales within our indirect channels could decline as we continue to control promotional pricing in an effort to improve profitability percentages 
this increasing mix of business in our direct channels should increase our overall product gross margin 
we anticipate that operating expenses  primarily targeted to support increased sales growth  will increase at a rate similar to that of our sales growth 
overall  continued sales growth  along with controlled spending  should result in growth in operating earnings 
capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with fiscal year s spending
