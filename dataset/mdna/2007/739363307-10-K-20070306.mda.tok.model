item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the realization of which may be impacted by certain important factors including  but not limited to  those risk factors disclosed pursuant to item a 
introduction and overview powerwave is a global supplier of end to end wireless solutions for wireless communications networks 
our business consists of the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of products to improve coverage  capacity and data speed in wireless communication networks  including antennas  boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions 
these products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world that support voice and data communications by use of cell phones and other wireless communication devices 
we sell such products to both original equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products into their proprietary base stations which they then sell to wireless network operators  and directly to individual wireless network operators for deployment into their existing networks 
on september   we sold our contract manufacturing subsidiary  arkivator 
consequently  the contract manufacturing segment is classified as a discontinued operation and its results are removed from continuing operations for all reporting periods presented 
for periods prior to fiscal  we have presented our previously reported results excluding the contract manufacturing segment 
on october   we completed the acquisition of the wireless infrastructure divison business of filtronic plc the filtronic wireless acquisition 
during the last six years  demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment has fluctuated dramatically 
while demand for wireless infrastructure was strong during  it weakened for powerwave during due to significant reductions at three customers 
in the past there have been significant slowdowns in capital spending by wireless network operators due to delays in the expected deployment of infrastructure equipment and financial difficulties on the part of the wireless network operators who were forced to consolidate and reduce spending to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their profitability 
these changes had a significant negative impact on overall demand for wireless infrastructure products  and at various times  have directly reduced demand for our products and increased price competition within our industry which has in the past led to reductions in our revenues and contributed to our reported operating losses 
during fiscal  we experienced a significant slowdown in demand from one of our direct network operator customers  cingular wireless  as well as reduced demand from one of our original equipment manufacturing customers  nortel networks and a significant reduction in demand from nokia and siemens in the fourth quarter of  all of which combined directly reduced demand for our products and contributed to our operating loss for fiscal we believe that we have maintained our overall market share within the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market during this period 
we continue to invest in the research and development of wireless communications network technology and the diversification of our product offerings  and we believe that we have one of our industry s leading product portfolios in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our proprietary design technology is a further differentiator for our products 
looking back over the last several years  beginning in fiscal we focused on cost savings while we expanded our market opportunities  as evidenced by our acquisition of lgp allgon 
this acquisition involved the integration of two companies based in different countries that previously operated independently  which was a complex  costly and time consuming process 
we have implemented our plans to restructure and integrate lgp allgon s operations  technology and personnel with ours 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on cost savings while we expanded our market opportunities  as evidenced by our acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of remec  inc s wireless systems business the remec wireless acquisition 
we believe that this acquisition further strengthened our position in the global wireless infrastructure market 
we have implemented our plans to restructure and integrate the acquired remec operations  technology and personnel with our operations 
in october  we completed the filtronic wireless acquisition 
we believe that this strategic acquisition provides us with the leading position in transmit and receive filter products  as well as broadens our rf conditioning and base 
table of contents station solutions product portfolio and adds significant additional technology to our intellectual property portfolio 
for fiscal year  we are focused on finalizing our plans to integrate this acquisition  consolidate its operations and reduce our overall cost structure 
these acquisitions do not provide any guarantee that our revenues will increase 
we measure our success by monitoring our net sales by product and consolidated gross margins  with a short term goal of maintaining a positive operating cash flow while striving to achieve long term operating profits 
we believe that there continues to be long term growth opportunities within the wireless communications infrastructure marketplace  and we are focused on positioning powerwave to benefit from these long term opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the critical accounting policies that we believe are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is derived from the sales of products 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or delivery and passage of title depending upon the terms of the sale 
we offer certain of our customers the right to return products within a limited time after delivery under specified circumstances  generally related to product defects 
we monitor and track such product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are highly concentrated in a small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
depending on the product line  such provisions are established based on historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these provisions reduce the cost basis of the respective inventory 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past three fiscal years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in 
table of contents which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventory is sold 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
income taxes we recognize current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the associated income statement benefit or expense  based on our reported operating results and the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities in each separate tax jurisdiction within which we conduct business 
we do not provide deferred us income taxes on undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries where we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested 
given the global scope of our operations and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to predict and thereafter realize our earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
this has resulted in  and could continue to result in  significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences within each taxing jurisdiction 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development  we typically engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and in process research and development entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and expected costs to complete development projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  estimating probability rates for the successful completion of development projects  continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to the accounting value of the underlying net assets of such reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize subjective valuations for the reporting unit based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon a number of various factors including estimates of forecasted revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
if the forecast assumptions utilized materially change  it could result in a lower fair value calculation which could require an impairment of existing goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the underlying net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is less than the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all its underlying identifiable assets and liabilities 
purchased intangible assets with determinable useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which generally range up to years 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long lived assets  including fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
the actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from our estimates due to increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value of an asset is determined not to be recoverable from future 
table of contents operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
while we do not believe that any of our intangible or other long lived assets are currently impaired  there have been impairments in the current year as well as in the past  and any future impairment of such assets could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for standard warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of the sale and update such estimate throughout the warranty period 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
we also have contractual commitments to various customers that require us to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to our products outside of our standard warranty period if such defect were to occur 
any costs related to epidemic defects are generally recorded at the time the epidemic defect becomes known to us and the costs of repair can be reasonably estimated 
while we have experienced occasional significant costs due to epidemic defects  we have not historically regularly experienced significant costs related to epidemic defects 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience significant costs to repair epidemic defects in the future 
a significant increase in product return rates  a significant increase in the costs to repair our products  or an unexpected epidemic defect in our products  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results during the period in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
accruals for restructuring and impairment charges we recorded million  million and million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal years  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of and in connection with the filtronic wireless acquisition  we formulated and began to implement a plan to restructure our global manufacturing operations with an initial primary focus on our operations in china 
the china restructuring plan involves consolidating our manufacturing facilities in wuxi and shanghai  china  into the manufacturing facility in suzhou  china  acquired in the filtronic wireless acquisition 
we are continuing to evaluate our initial restructuring and consolidation plans for the filtronic wireless operations and we expect to finalize these plans in the first half of fiscal in connection with the remec wireless acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized million as liabilities in connection with the acquisition for estimated restructuring and integration costs related to the consolidation of remec s wireless operations  including severance and future lease obligations on excess facilities 
integration activities related to this restructuring plan are substantially complete 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition of lgp allgon in may  we recorded million of additional restructuring liabilities and asset write downs under purchase accounting for expected integration and consolidation activities related to their operations 
integration activities related to this restructuring plan are substantially complete 
all of these restructuring and impairment accruals related primarily to workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities  and the discontinuation of certain product lines  including the associated write downs of inventory  manufacturing and test equipment  and certain intangible assets 
such accruals were based on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters which were uncertain at the time  including the timing and amount of sublease income that will be recovered on vacated property and the net realizable value of used equipment that is no longer needed in our continuing operations 
while we used our best current estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time to quantify these charges  different estimates could reasonably be used in the relevant periods to arrive at different accruals and or the actual amounts incurred or recovered may be substantially different from the assumptions utilized  either of which could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations for a given period 
as a result  we periodically review the estimates and assumptions used and reflect the effects of those revisions in the period that they become known

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes powerwave s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december   january   and january  fiscal years ended december  january  january  net sales cost of sales cost of goods intangible asset amortization restructuring and impairment charges acquired inventory incremental costs total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative intangible asset amortization in process research and development restructuring and impairment charges total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of income taxes income loss from discontinued operations loss on sale of subsidiary total discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss years ended december  and january  net sales our sales are derived from the sale of wireless communications network products and coverage solutions  including antennas  boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions for use in cellular  pcs  and g wireless communications networks throughout the world 
sales decreased by to million  for the year ended december   from million  for the year ended january  this decrease was due to several factors  which included significant lower demand from our direct operator customers  which decreased by million or from fiscal year to one major contributor to this decline was cingular wireless who reduced direct purchases by million and accounted for a large portion of the remaining reduction 
while the reduced revenue from direct operator customers was somewhat offset by increased demand from our original equipment manufacturer customers of approximately million  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant reduction in demand from nokia and siemens 
we believe that this reduction is due to the pending merger of nokia s and siemens wireless infrastructure businesses 
this reduction in demand also significantly impacted the revenues from products acquired in the fourth quarter of associated with the filtronic wireless acquisition 
the following table presents a further analysis of our sales based upon our various product groups 
table of contents wireless communications product groups fiscal years ended in thousands december  january  antenna systems base station subsystems coverage solutions total net sales antenna systems consist of base station antennas and tower mounted amplifiers 
base station subsystems consist of products that are installed into or around the base station of wireless networks and include products such as boosters  combiners  filters  outdoor cabinets and radio frequency power amplifiers 
coverage solutions consist primarily of repeaters and advanced coverage solutions 
the decrease in all the product groups is due to the impact of lower demand during the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  we track the geographic location of our sales based upon the location of our customers to which our products are shipped 
since many of our customers purchase products from us at central locations and then reship the product with other base station equipment to locations throughout the world  we are unable to identify the final installation location of our products 
the following table presents an analysis of our net sales based upon the geographic area to which a product was shipped geographic area fiscal years ended in thousands december  january  americas asia europe other international total net sales revenues in the americas decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of reduced demand by cingular wireless and nortel 
since wireless network infrastructure spending is dependent on individual network coverage and capacity demands  we do not believe that our revenue fluctuations for any geographic region are necessarily indicative of a predictable trend for our future revenues by geographic area 
in addition  as noted above  growth in one geographic location may not reflect actual demand growth in that location due to the centralized buying processes of our original equipment manufacturer customers 
for the year ended december   total sales to nokia accounted for approximately of sales and sales to siemens accounted for approximately for the period 
for the year ended january   total sales to cingular wireless accounted for approximately of sales and sales to nokia accounted for approximately 
we currently believe that the decrease in our sales to cingular wireless during fiscal was the result of a reduction in demand for products due to excess original equipment manufacturer s inventories at cingular wireless which caused them to reduce new purchases during notwithstanding our acquisitions  our business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of customers within the wireless communications market and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in attracting new customers or retaining or increasing business with our existing customers 
a number of factors have caused delays and may cause future delays in new wireless infrastructure and upgrade deployment schedules throughout the world  including deployments in the united states  europe  asia  south america and other areas 
in addition  a number of factors may cause original equipment manufacturers to alter their outsourcing strategy concerning certain wireless communications network products  which could cause such original equipment manufacturers to reduce or eliminate their demand for external supplies of such products or shift their demand to alternative suppliers or internal suppliers 
such factors include lower perceived internal manufacturing costs and competitive reasons to remain vertically integrated 
due to the possible uncertainties associated with wireless infrastructure deployments and original equipment manufacturer demand  we have experienced and expect 
table of contents to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand from our original equipment manufacturer and network operator customers 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in our revenues and or operating results  which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of sales and gross profit our cost of sales includes both fixed and variable cost components and consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs  warranty costs and amortization of product related intangibles 
components of our fixed cost structure include test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
in addition  as we have acquired additional businesses with additional manufacturing facilities  as demand and sales decrease  the amounts expensed to cost of sales increases due to the additional overhead costs that are not being absorbed 
conversely  the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
the following table presents an analysis of our gross profit fiscal years ended in thousands december  january  net sales cost of sales cost of goods intangible asset amortization restructuring and impairment charges acquired inventory incremental costs total cost of sales gross profit our total gross profit decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our decreased revenues 
in addition  our gross profit margin declined due to both the poor absorption of our manufacturing overheads due to the lower sales revenues during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the increased manufacturing overhead costs associated with the filtronic wireless acquisition 
also contributing to the reduction in our gross profit percentage was a reduction in direct operator sales as a percentage of total sales  which typically have carried higher margins than our original equipment manufacturers based sales 
our gross profit percentage was also reduced due to increased intangible amortization costs due to the filtronic wireless acquisition and a full year of intangible asset amortization association with the remec wireless acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that approximately million of identified intangible assets had become impaired due to decisions to cease production of certain product lines acquired as part of the remec wireless acquisition 
this charge is included in intangible asset amortization for we also incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in related to restructuring plans implemented in conjunction with the china manufacturing consolidation and certain acquisitions related restructuring plans see note restructuring and impairment charges of the notes to consolidated financial statements under part ii
