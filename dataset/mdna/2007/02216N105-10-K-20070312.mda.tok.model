item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the selected consolidated financial data included in item above and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this document  particularly in item a above 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of oral and injectable protein therapeutics for gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders  with two product candidates in clinical development 
we are using our proprietary protein crystallization technology to develop protein therapies  which we believe will have significant advantages over existing products and will address unmet medical needs 
our product candidates are designed to either increase the amount of a protein that is in short supply in the body or degrade the toxic metabolites in the gut and remove them from the blood stream 
our two lead product candidates are altu  for which we have completed a phase ii clinical trial in cystic fibrosis patients for the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency  and altu  for which we have completed a phase ii clinical trial in adults for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency 
our lead preclinical product candidate  altu  is an orally administered crystalline formulation of an oxalate degrading enzyme  which we have designed for the treatment of hyperoxalurias 
we plan to file an ind for altu for the treatment of hyperoxalurias in the first half of we also have a pipeline of other product candidates in preclinical research and development 
we have generated significant losses as we have advanced our lead product candidates in clinical development and expect to continue to generate losses as altu and altu move into later stages of clinical development  and as altu and our other pre clinical product candidates advance to clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
on january   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately million 
we intend to use our existing cash resources to fund a portion of the development and commercialization activities for altu  and the remainder to fund research and development activities for our preclinical product candidates and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital 
financial operations overview revenue 
our contract revenue through consists of amounts earned under collaborative research and development agreements relating to altu with cffti and dr 
falk 
in february  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with cffti to collaborate on the development of altu and specified derivatives of altu in north america for the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis and other indications 
the agreement  in general terms  provides us with funding from cffti for a portion of the development costs of altu upon the achievement of specified development milestones  up to a total of million  in return for specified payment obligations and our obligation to use good faith reasonable efforts to develop and bring altu to market in north america 
as of december   we had received a total of million of the million available under the cffti agreement and recognized cumulative revenue of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we may receive an additional milestone payment of million  less an amount determined by when we achieve the milestone 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approval of altu  we will be required to pay cffti a license fee equal to the aggregate amount of milestone payments we have received from cffti  plus interest  up to a 
table of contents maximum of million  less the fair market value of the shares of stock underlying the warrants we issued to cffti 
this fee  plus interest on the unpaid balance  will be due in four annual installments  commencing days after the approval date 
we are also required to pay an additional million to cffti within days after the approval date 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties to cffti consisting of a percentage of worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of altu for any and all indications until the expiration of specified united states patents covering altu we have the option to terminate our ongoing royalty obligation by making a one time payment to cffti  but we currently do not expect to do so 
under the agreement  cffti has also agreed to provide us with reasonable access to its network of medical providers  patients  researchers and others involved in the care and treatment of cystic fibrosis patients  and to use reasonable efforts to promote the involvement of these parties in the development of altu in connection with the execution of the cffti agreement and the first amendment of the agreement  we have issued to cffti warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  including  warrants with a fair value of million issued at the time of the agreement in february the fair value of the  warrants is being recognized as a discount to contract revenue and amortized against the gross revenue earned under the contract 
as of december   approximately million remains to be amortized against future revenues under the agreement 
in december  we entered into a development  commercialization and marketing agreement with dr 
falk for the development by us of altu and the commercialization by dr 
falk of altu  if approved  in europe  the countries of the former soviet union  israel and egypt 
under the agreement  we granted dr 
falk an exclusive  sublicensable license under specified patents that cover altu to commercialize altu for the treatment of symptoms caused by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
as of december   we had received upfront and milestone payments from dr 
falk under the agreement totaling million  which equated to million based on exchange rates in effect at the times we received the milestone payments  and recognized cumulative revenue of million 
because our planned phase iii clinical trial is not an international phase iii clinical trial which supports emea marketing approval  we do not expect to receive any reimbursement from dr 
falk for this trial 
dr 
falk holds all commercialization and marketing rights in the licensed territory  and we are entitled to receive royalties based on the net sales of altu in the licensed territory and revenue for the altu capsules supplied by us to dr 
falk 
under the terms of the agreement  the license to dr 
falk will continue in each country in the licensed territory until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of specified patents that cover altu in that country or years from the date of first commercial sale of altu in that country 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech  inc for the development  manufacture and commercialization of altu the effective date of the agreement was february   following expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech exclusive rights and a license to make and have made  use and import altu  and to sell altu in north america following fda approval 
genentech also has the option to expand the agreement to a global agreement 
the agreement  in general terms  provides that genentech will assume full responsibility for the development  manufacture and commercialization of altu pursuant to the agreement  genentech agreed to make specific cash payments to us  including an up front payment of million  which consists of million in non refundable license fee payments and million in exchange for  shares of common stock 
genentech also agreed to make cash payments to us based on the achievement of performance milestones during the clinical development  regulatory approval and commercialization process in the aggregate of approximately million  and to reimburse us for various development  manufacturing  regulatory  and commercialization activities that we perform on genentech s behalf 
if genentech exercises its global option  it may be required to pay us an additional million in upfront payments and milestones 
in addition  genentech will pay us royalties on any future net sales of altu in the licensed territory  whether north america or worldwide 
under the genentech agreement  we have the option to elect to co promote altu in north america 

table of contents in addition to contract revenue under our collaborations  we have also received research and development funding through grants from various united states government and non government institutions 
research and development funding generally compensates us for a portion of our costs for development and testing related to collaborative research programs or grants 
historically  our product sales consisted of revenue from the sale of crystallized enzymes for use as catalysts for the production of small molecule drugs and related development activities for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes 
we stopped selling these products during the first half of accordingly  since we have not generated revenue from product sales  and do not anticipate doing so in the future 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales represents the cost of manufacturing the crystallized enzyme catalysts discussed immediately above and consisted primarily of third party contract manufacturing expenses 
for products made internally  the costs consist primarily of payroll and payroll related expenses  chemicals  supplies and overhead expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of expenses incurred in developing and testing product candidates  including salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical and non clinical trials  performance of non clinical trials  including toxicity studies in animals  and depreciation of equipment used to develop our products and costs of facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we have completed our phase ii clinical trial of the capsule form of altu and are designing and preparing for our phase iii clinical trial and the long term safety study  which we expect will begin in the second quarter of  and conducting related development activities 
our current estimate of the total costs we will incur to complete the development of altu and file an nda with the fda is approximately million  excluding non cash compensation expense and depreciation 
we revised this estimate during the third quarter of from a previous estimate of million  due to changes in specific assumptions related to the cost of manufacturing and the conduct of the phase iii clinical trials 
the possibility exists that we may revise this estimate in the future 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million of these total costs 
we have also completed a phase ii clinical trial of altu from january   the date on which we began separately tracking development costs for altu  through december   we incurred approximately million in total development costs for this product candidate 
the amount of resources we devote to altu in the future is subject to genentech s development plan and whether genentech exercises its option to extend our agreement globally 
the parties may agree to have altus conduct certain efforts that would be subject to reimbursement by genentech 
we expect to file an ind for altu in the first half of through december   we have incurred approximately million in total development costs for this pre clinical product candidate 
we expect our research and development costs to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we move altu into phase iii trials  file an ind and initiate clinical trials for altu and continue the development of our pre clinical pipeline 
product candidates in clinical development have higher associated development costs than those in the preclinical stage since the former involve testing on humans while the latter involve shorter term animal studies 
moreover  as a product candidate moves into later stage clinical trials  such as from phase i to phase ii or phase ii to phase iii  the costs are significantly higher due to the increased size and length of the later stage trials 

table of contents the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of altu  altu or any of our preclinical product candidates  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows will commence 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  future clinical trial results  whether genentech will decide to exercise its option to make our collaboration agreement for altu a global agreement  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
general  sales and administrative expense 
general  sales and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  in our executive  sales  marketing  finance  accounting  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs primarily include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  advertising and promotion expenses  trade shows and professional fees for legal services  including patent related expenses  and accounting services 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future due to increased payroll  expanded marketing and administrative infrastructure  increased consulting  legal  accounting and investor relations expenses associated with being a public company and costs incurred to seek collaborations with respect to any of our product candidates 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and other debt financings  which are primarily equipment loans 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency gains losses 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
preferred stock dividends and accretion consists of cumulative but undeclared dividends payable and accretion of the issuance costs and warrants  where applicable  on our redeemable preferred stock and series b and c convertible preferred stock 
the issuance costs on these shares and warrants were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the preferred stock when issued  and are accreted to preferred stock ratably through december  by a charge to additional paid in capital and earnings attributable to common stockholders 
as of january   the cumulative dividends payable on the series b and c convertible preferred stock totaled million 
upon the completion of our initial public offering on january   the series b and series c convertible preferred stock converted into an 
table of contents aggregate of  shares of common stock  and the cumulative but unpaid dividends on the series b and c convertible preferred stock were satisfied through the issuance of  shares of common stock at the price of the common stock sold in the offering 
accordingly  there are no shares of series b or series c convertible preferred stock currently outstanding  and we no longer record preferred dividends and accretion on the series b and series c convertible preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses  deemed fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
substantially all the revenue we recognize is contract revenue from collaborative agreements 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  and eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
contract revenue includes revenue from collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development and commercial milestones and royalties on product sales 
contract revenue also includes non refundable research and development funding under collaborative agreements with corporate partners and grants from various non government institutions 
research and development funding generally reimburses us for a portion or all of the development and testing related to the collaborative research programs or grants 
collaborative agreements are often multiple element arrangements  providing for a license as well as research and development services 
we analyze agreements with multiple element arrangements to determine whether the deliverables under the agreement  including research and development services  can be separated or whether all of the deliverables must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations under the collaborative agreement can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately 
if the license is considered to either not have standalone value or have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
when we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we determine the period during which the performance obligations will be performed and the revenue related to payments will be recognized 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned as of the period ending date 
if we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement accounted for as a single unit of accounting and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis  we recognize revenue from such arrangement using the proportional performance method 

table of contents we use an input based measure  specifically direct costs  to determine proportional performance  because  for our current agreements  we believe the use of an input based measure is a more accurate reflection of the level of effort related to our research and development collaborations than an output based measure  such as milestones 
the impact of fluctuation in exchange rates under collaborative agreements that are denominated in a foreign currency is reflected in deferred revenue at the time cash is received and in revenue at each reporting period 
under the proportional performance method  periodic revenue related to upfront license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort budgeted for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
these estimates include the period of development  the size and complexity of the clinical trials and the cost and availability of clinical supplies 
we review our estimates quarterly  and may change our estimates in the future  resulting in a change in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized as of the date of the change in estimate 
since the inception of our collaboration agreements with cffti and dr 
falk  we have adjusted our estimated costs to complete the development program for altu on four occasions  including during the third quarters of and  resulting in cumulative changes in our revenue at each time of the change in the estimate 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our estimated development costs for altu  which resulted in a million increase in our cumulative revenue in the third quarter of during the third quarter of  we increased our estimated development costs for altu  which resulted in a million decrease in our cumulative revenue in the third quarter of the possibility exists that revenue may increase or decrease in future periods as estimated costs of the underlying program increase or decrease or as exchange rates impact the value of foreign currency denominated collaborations  without additional cash inflows from the collaborative partner or non government institution 
for example  as of december   if our estimated total development costs for altu were to increase by  it would result in a million reduction of cumulative revenue 
if our estimated total development costs for altu were to decrease by  it would result in a million increase in cumulative revenue 
reimbursement of research and development costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf issue no 
are met  the amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
contract amounts which are not due until the customer accepts or verifies the research results are not recognized as revenue until the customer s acceptance or verification of the results is evidenced and collection is probable 
in the event warrants are issued in connection with a collaborative agreement  contract revenue is recorded net of amortization of the estimated fair value of the related warrants 
deferred revenue at december  and consists of payments received in advance of revenue recognized under collaborative agreements 
since the payments received under the collaborative agreements are non refundable  the termination of a collaborative agreement prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received from the collaborative partner but not previously recognized as revenue 
research and development funding under grants from the united states government and its agencies is recognized as revenue as development costs are incurred and billed in accordance with the terms of the grant 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical sites and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials for clinical and non clinical trials  and professional service fees 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our 
table of contents understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
in the event that we do not identify costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high  and revenue may be overstated or understated to the extent such expenses relate to collaborations accounted for using the proportional performance method 
the date on which specified services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services is often judgmental 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of inaccurate estimates  in part  by communicating with our service providers when other evidence of costs incurred is unavailable 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  as required  using the modified prospective transition method 
we continue to determine the fair value of the equity instruments using the black scholes option pricing model and to recognize compensation cost ratably over the appropriate vesting period 
prior to january   we had accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which are similar to those in sfas r except that sfas allowed forfeitures to be accounted for as they occur 
as a result  the adoption of sfas r did not have a material impact on our comparative results 
we account for transactions in which goods and services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such goods and services received or the deemed fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
the fair value is recorded as stock based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can not be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees  directors  consultants and other non employees  we determine the fair value of the equity instruments using all relevant information  including application of the black scholes option pricing model and  in specified situations  input from valuation specialists  all of which require various estimates and assumptions 
different estimates and assumptions can yield materially different results 
the factors which most affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation include the deemed fair value of the common stock underlying the equity instruments for which stock based compensation is recorded  the volatility of such deemed fair value  the estimated life of the equity instrument  and the assumed risk free rate of return 
because there was no public market for shares of our common stock prior to our initial public offering in january  we had to estimate the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes before that date 
factors that we considered when determining the fair value of our common stock included pricing of private sales of our convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and convertible preferred stock sales and the effect of events  including the progression of our product candidates  that have occurred between the time of the grants or sales  comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity  comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares issued  perspective provided by valuation specialists  any perspective provided by any investment banks  including the likelihood of an initial public offering and the potential value of the company in an initial public offering  and general economic trends 
if our estimates of the deemed fair value of these equity instruments or other judgments and assumptions had been too high or too low  it would have had the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
the fair value of our equity instruments  excluding preferred stock  granted prior to our consideration of a public offering was historically determined by our board of directors based upon information available to it 
table of contents on the measurement dates 
however  in  we performed a retrospective analysis to determine the deemed fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes in light of the potential for an initial public offering 
this retrospective analysis addressed the deemed fair market value of our common stock at key points in time in and we performed our analysis in accordance with several elements of a practice aid issued by the american institute of certified public accountants entitled valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
we used two primary valuation methodologies within the market approach in the practice aid  including a guideline public company analysis  or comparable company ipo analysis  and a guideline transactions analysis  or comparable company m a analysis  to determine the estimated deemed fair market value of our equity during the period discussed above 
we then allocated value between the preferred stock and the common stock under each analysis and arrived at the value of the common stock based on a probability weighted expected return methodology 
now that our common stock is publicly traded  we will use the value of that stock to determine the fair value of any equity instruments we issue going forward 
upon the initial filing of our registration statement on form s on october   we began utilizing a volatility factor in the black scholes model to value options granted to employees 
prior to such date  we had excluded a volatility factor  as permitted for private companies under the provisions of sfas no 
we believe the use of a volatility factor will cause our employee stock based compensation expense to increase going forward 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire starting in  federal research and development credit carryforwards of million and total net deferred tax assets of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would create an income tax benefit in the period in which such a determination is made 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year in the event of a change in ownership 
given our change in ownership as a result of the initial public offering  our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands contract revenue product sales total revenue overview contract revenue is primarily generated from revenue recognized under the proportional performance method from our collaborative agreements for altu with cffti and dr 
falk 
under this methodology  to the extent we incur direct development costs each year to advance altu  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of actual costs spent to our estimate of total direct development costs 
the fluctuations in contract revenue from year to year reflects the effects of two factors a the level of development spending on altu  which directly correlates to revenue recognized  and b changes to our 
table of contents estimate in total direct development costs for altu  which may necessitate a positive or negative cumulative revenue adjustment 
as compared to contract revenue for decreased  or million  from the decrease reflects the combined unfavorable impact of million resulting from a negative revenue adjustment of million in the third quarter of due to an increase in our estimate of total development costs for altu coupled with a positive adjustment of million recognized in the third quarter of resulting from a reduction of our estimated development costs at that time 
offsetting the combination of these adjustments was additional revenue recorded in directly correlated to the increase in development spending on altu in as compared to contract revenue for increased  or million  from due primarily to an increase in development activities relating to altu and a reduction of our estimated development costs for altu in the third quarter of  resulting in a million positive adjustment to cumulative revenue 
product sales were million in and ceased thereafter due to our decision to stop selling crystallized enzymes for use as catalysts in the production of small molecule drugs during the first half of cost of product sales we incurred no cost of product sales in or as compared to million in in and  there were no product sales 
research and development expense years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands altu altu altu other research and development total research and development as compared to research and development expense for increased due primarily to an increase in third party development costs relating to altu  altu and our pre clinical product candidates  increased non cash compensation expense and an increase in personnel 
during  we incurred million in costs related to payments made to lonza to purchase equipment to establish its manufacturing facility and start up costs paid to lonza for the manufacture of the commercial supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients  or api s  in altu other altu costs for the period related to the manufacturing of materials for planned toxicity and phase iii studies  including increased formulation and process development work for altu  as well as activities relating to a technical transfer to amano of processes related to the manufacture of the apis in altu altu costs during related to the completion of a phase ii clinical trial in growth hormone deficient adults  the purchase of materials for ongoing process development and formulation activities related to our planned phase iii clinical trials in adults and phase ii and phase iii clinical trials in pediatric patients  facility modification costs  technology transfer costs and validation costs relating to our clinical supply agreement with althea for altu  and phase iii related toxicology studies 
in addition  we incurred increased pre clinical costs in primarily related to altu prior to  we did not separately track costs relating to altu to support this increased level of activity  our research and development headcount increased to full time employees at december  from full time employees at december  product candidates in clinical development have greater associated development costs than those in the research or preclinical stage  and as a product candidate moves to later stage clinical trials  such as a phase iii clinical trial  the costs are higher due to the increased size and length of the clinical trial versus an earlier 
table of contents stage clinical trial 
as a result  we anticipate that our research and development costs will continue to increase in coming periods as altu progresses into phase iii clinical trials  altu begins phase i trials and as our pre clinical product candidates advance in our pipeline 
the amount of resources we will devote to altu in the future is subject to genentech s development plan and whether genentech exercises its option to extend our agreement globally 
the parties may agree to have altus conduct certain efforts that would be subject to reimbursement by genentech 
as compared to research and development expense for increased due primarily to an increase in development costs relating to altu and altu during  we completed a phase ii clinical trial for altu and filed an ind  completed a phase i clinical trial and started a phase ii clinical trial for altu to support the increased activities  our headcount in the research and development area increased to full time employees as of december  from as of december  general  sales and administrative expense years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands personnel legal services general insurance marketing costs consulting and professional services stock based compensation other general and administrative total general  sales and administrative as compared to general  sales and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased from the prior year primarily due to increased costs associated with being a public company and an increase in marketing costs as we build our marketing infrastructure as our product candidates  altu and altu  advance through clinical trials 
as a result of completing our initial public offering in january  our legal costs  general insurance costs and consulting and professional service costs have increased by million 
in addition  our stock based compensation expense for increased by million as we added personnel into the general  sales and administrative group as well as changed our assumptions used to value stock options under sfas r 
we expect that general  sales and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future due to increased payroll  expanded infrastructure  increased consulting  legal  accounting and investor relations expenses associated with being a public company and costs incurred to seek collaborations with respect to our product candidates 
as compared to general  sales and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased from the prior year primarily due to increased personnel costs  legal costs and marketing costs  as well as an increase in stock based compensation 
during  we continued to grow our general  sales and administrative departments and granted an increased number of stock options during as compared to as part of the growth 
in addition  in light of our then contemplated initial public offering  we performed a retrospective analysis of the fair value of our common stock to determine the deemed fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense being recognized during this retrospective analysis did not affect expense 

table of contents other income expense net years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands interest income interest expense foreign currency loss gain and other total other income expense net as compared to interest income increased in over primarily due to higher investment balances as a result of the proceeds from our initial public offering in january and  to a lesser degree  higher average interest rates in interest expense was slightly lower in based on lower outstanding principal balances 
foreign currency gains and losses were immaterial in compared to a million loss in as compared to interest income increased in over due primarily to higher investment balances from funds received from our series c preferred stock financing in may and  to a lesser degree  higher average interest rates in interest expense was higher in due to an increase in our average debt outstanding in and higher interest rates on borrowings 
we recognized foreign currency losses of million in compared to a foreign exchange gain of million in preferred stock dividends and accretion years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands preferred stock dividends and accretion as compared to preferred stock dividends and accretion decreased in due to the automatic conversion of all shares of series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock into common stock in connection with the initial public offering in january we continue to accrue stock dividends and accretion on our outstanding redeemable preferred stock 
as compared to preferred stock dividends and accretion increased to million from million in due to the issuance of the series c preferred stock in may liquidity and capital resources overview we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our collaborators  borrowings and capital lease financings and  prior to the middle of  revenue from product sales 
on january   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
from september until the time of the initial public offering  we funded our activities primarily with issuances of convertible preferred stock 
in may  we received approximately million from the issuance of series c convertible preferred stock 
in september and december  we received approximately million from the issuance of series b convertible preferred stock 
prior to september  we received most of our equity and debt financing proceeds from the issuance of notes  common stock and preferred stock to vertex  including redeemable preferred stock and series a convertible preferred stock 
the series a  b and c convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock upon the closing of the initial public offering  and accrued but unpaid dividends were satisfied through issuance of shares of our common stock upon the closing of the offering at the offering price 
the outstanding redeemable preferred stock  which is not convertible into common stock  is redeemable  at the holder s option  on or after december   or by us at our option at any time 
the liquidation preference of the redeemable preferred stock at december  
table of contents was million and includes accrued but unpaid dividends on the redeemable preferred stock of million 
assuming we do not exercise our right to repurchase the redeemable preferred stock before december   the accrued and unpaid dividends at that date will be million 
as of december   we had received million from our collaborative agreement with cffti and million from our collaborative agreement with dr 
falk 
we are entitled to receive up to million of future milestone payments under these two collaborations if all development milestones are met 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech for the development  manufacture and commercialization of altu in north america 
pursuant to the agreement  genentech will make a million upfront payment  with the potential for us to receive additional payments of approximately million based upon the successful completion of development and commercialization milestones 
in conjunction with this agreement  we have received million from the sale of  shares of our common stock to genentech 
in addition  if genentech exercises its global option  we could potentially receive additional payments of more than million  comprised of additional upfront and milestone payments 
upon any commercialization  we will receive royalties on net sales of altu the amount of resources we devote to altu in the future is subject to genentech s development plan and whether genentech exercises its option to extend our agreement globally 
the parties may agree to have altus conduct certain efforts that would be subject to reimbursement by genentech 
summary cash flow information increase decrease december  to to dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital years ended december  dollars in thousands cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of our constant evaluation of conditions in the financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
our funds at december  were invested in investment grade securities and money market funds 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses while we have advanced our product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials 
accordingly  we have historically used cash in our operating activities 
during the years ended december  and  our operating activities used million and million of cash and cash equivalents 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of expenditures associated with our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop and maintain our administrative infrastructure  offset partially in by milestone payments received from our collaborators 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting million used to purchase marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from the maturity and sale of marketable securities of million and million for capital expenditures 
during  investing activities provided million  reflecting million of gross proceeds from the maturity or sale of 
table of contents marketable securities  partially offset by million of purchases of marketable securities and million of capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million  primarily reflecting the net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in january in addition  we received million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  and an additional million from new borrowings under our capital equipment facility  and made repayments of long term debt principal of million 
for the year ended december   proceeds from long term debt of million and the exercise of stock options of approximately million partially offset repayments of long term debt principal of million and payment of costs associated with the initial public offering of million 
we have generally financed a substantial portion of our capital expenditures through equipment loans under which the lender retains a security interest in the equipment 
the capital equipment loans are governed by a master loan and security agreement that contains the key terms of the loans 
the master loan and security agreement require us to maintain insurance on the collateral 
each loan carries a fixed rate of interest which was established at the time of borrowing and is payable in fixed monthly installments over periods of up to four years 
we intend to secure additional equipment loans to continue to finance a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period through through after total dollars in thousands contractual obligations short and long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations excludes estimated payment of million to vertex in connection with its optional redemption of shares of redeemable preferred stock on or after december   plus dividends accruing after that date  and amounts payable to cffti upon fda approval of altu and royalties to cffti on product sales of altu includes interest expense 
funding requirements we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities together with our expected cash inflow from collaborative agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least mid however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses while we have advanced our product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials 
as we continue to advance our product candidates through development and begin to incur increased sales and marketing costs related to commercialization of our product candidates  we expect to incur additional operating losses until such time  if any  as our efforts result in commercially viable drug products 
we do not expect our existing capital resources  together with the milestone payments and 
table of contents research and development funding we expect to receive  to be sufficient to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  and we expect that we will need to raise additional funds prior to being able to market any products 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the continued development progress on altu and altu  including the completion of nonclinical and clinical trials and the results of these studies  our ability to discover additional clinical product candidates from our preclinical portfolio using our drug discovery technology and advance them into clinical development  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborations  the timing and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims for our drug discovery technology and product candidates and avoiding the infringement of intellectual property rights of others  the decision by genentech as to whether to exercise its option under our collaboration agreement for altu to make the collaboration global  the potential acquisition and in licensing of other technologies  products or assets  the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our product candidates  and the cost of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities  if any 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues  other than payments that we receive from our current collaborators or other similar collaborations we may enter into in the future  until we successfully obtain marketing approval for  and begin selling one or more of our product candidates 
we believe the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are our ability to successfully develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize altu  the success of the genentech collaboration for altu  the success of our development program for altu and other preclinical programs  our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with corporate collaborators and the success of such collaborations  and the receptivity of the capital markets to financings of biotechnology companies 
we may raise funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than operating leases 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested with highly rated financial institutions in north america with the primary objective of preservation of principal  while maintaining liquidity and generating favorable yields 
when purchased  investments have a maturity of less than months 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
to minimize the risk associated with changing interest rates  we invest primarily in bank certificates of deposit  united states government securities and investment grade commercial paper and corporate notes 
substantially all of our investments at december  met these criteria 
at december   we had gross unrealized gains of approximately  on our investments 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
our total debt at december  was million  primarily representing drawdowns under our lease credit facilities and expired capital equipment facilities 
all borrowings under these credit facilities carried fixed rates of interest established at the time such drawdowns were made 
accordingly  our future interest costs relating to such drawdowns are not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates 
our assets are principally located in the united states and substantially all of our historical revenues and operating expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
contract revenue under our collaboration with dr 
falk and some of our purchases of raw materials are denominated in euros 
accordingly  we are subject to market risk with respect to foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
we had foreign currency exchange losses of million in there were no foreign currency gains or losses in if the average euro united states dollar exchange rate were to strengthen or weaken by against the average respective exchange rates experienced in or  we estimate that the impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
since altu has not reached commercialization in north america or in the territory covered by the dr 
falk agreement  we do not believe we are subject to significant foreign currency risk at this time 
we may engage in additional collaborations with international partners 
when altu or any other future drug candidates reach commercialization outside of the united states  if at all  or we enter into additional collaborations with international partners providing for foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses  we may be subject to significant market risk
