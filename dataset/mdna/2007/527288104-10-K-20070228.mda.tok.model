item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report and notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a number of risks 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  before you decide whether to purchase our common stock 
the risks set out below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible  and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares 
we continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of our existing operations and investigate possible acquisitions of new businesses 
any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities 
consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition  results of operations and trading price at the present time 
future acquisitions and investments may expose us to risks to which we are not currently subject 
future acquisitions and investments may expose us to risks such as o the possibility that future acquisitions and investments may not immediately  if ever  add value to our company  o diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses  and o the possibility that the acquired businesses or investments will generate insufficient profits to offset the increased expenses associated with the acquisitions 
our ability to make future acquisitions and investments successfully depends on a range of factors  including our ability to identify and compete with others for potential acquisition targets  the acquisition price  terms and conditions of any completed acquisitions  and the future profitability of any new acquisitions and investments 
we are dependent on certain key personnel 
we are dependent on the services of ian m 
cumming and joseph s 
steinberg  our chairman of the board and president  respectively 
messrs 
cumming s and steinberg s employment agreements with us expire june  these individuals are also significant shareholders of our company 
as of february   messrs 
cumming and steinberg and their respective families excluding certain private charitable foundations beneficially owned approximately and of our outstanding common shares  respectively 
accordingly  messrs 
cumming and steinberg exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we operate in a variety of industries and market sectors  certain of which may be more susceptible to economic downturns than others 
the industries in which we operate may be subject to the effects of national or local economic cycles  increased competition and changes in demographic conditions  any of which may adversely affect our businesses and are beyond our control 
changes in economic conditions in the us or internationally can cause fluctuation in prices and sales volumes which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
a worsening of general economic or market conditions may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments or have a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets 
declines in the us housing market could reduce revenues and profitability of the manufacturing businesses 
revenues at our manufacturing segments benefit from strong new housing starts and the strong home improvement market in the us declines in the us housing market  resulting from local  regional  national or international economic changes  or from other factors  including increases in mortgage interest rate levels  have negatively impacted the revenues and profits of our manufacturing businesses  which could continue 
we are subject to risks associated with increased volatility in raw material prices and availability of key raw materials 
idaho timber and conwed plastics purchase significant amounts of raw materials from third parties for use in their operations 
the price for polypropylene  the principal raw material used by conwed plastics  tends to fluctuate with the price of oil and as a result has risen significantly over the past couple of years 
to the extent this trend continues and we are unable to pass these price increases to our customers  our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
a significant portion of idaho timber s raw material purchases are from foreign suppliers  and the availability of that supply can be adversely impacted by trade disputes  or by the imposition of export tariffs on canadian imports resulting from the softwood lumber agreement between canada and the us in addition  raw material prices at idaho timber will not always rise and fall in proportion to selling prices of idaho timber s products  which can have a negative impact on operating results 
from time to time we are subject to litigation  for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined  may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not material to the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  adverse determinations in specific legal matters could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
see item  legal proceedings for additional information 
premier is located in a geographic area subject to catastrophic storms  and it may not be able to purchase sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable price 
subsequent to hurricane katrina  the availability of catastrophic insurance coverage was reduced and premiums increased significantly 
if premier is unable to purchase insurance coverage for catastrophic losses  the company could suffer a material loss from a hurricane 
premier  as a debtor in possession  must obtain bankruptcy court approval for the conduct of its business and may not be successful in obtaining approval for its plan of reorganization or in obtaining the necessary funds to rebuild the hard rock biloxi 
if the bankruptcy court does not approve premier s plan of reorganization  or otherwise provide premier with access to insurance proceeds currently under the control of premier s pre petition bondholders in a timely manner  premier will not be able to repair and rebuild the hard rock biloxi or carry out its business plan in a timely manner  which would result in losses for the company 
premier could encounter problems during reconstruction that could substantially increase the construction costs or delay the opening of the hard rock biloxi 
reconstruction projects like the hard rock biloxi are subject to significant development and construction risks  which can cause unanticipated cost increases and delays 
these include  among others  shortages of materials and skilled labor  adverse weather which damages the project or causes delays  delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits  licenses and approvals  including alcoholic beverage licensing and gaming commission approval  changes in statutes  regulations  policies and agency interpretations of laws applicable to gaming projects  changes to the plans or specifications for premier s rebuilding efforts  engineering problems  labor disputes and work stoppages  environmental issues  fire  flooding and other natural disasters  and geological  construction  excavation  regulatory and equipment problems 
premier has no operating history or history of earnings and does not have any experience developing or operating a gaming facility 
following reconstruction  the hard rock biloxi will be a new business and  accordingly  will be subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
if premier is unable to manage these risks successfully  or fail to attract a sufficient number of guests  gaming customers and other visitors to the hard rock biloxi  it would negatively impact its operations 
the right to operate the hard rock biloxi is contingent upon governmental approval 
a revocation  suspension  limit or condition of premier s gaming licenses or registrations would result in a material adverse effect on its business 
if premier s gaming licenses and or registrations are revoked for any reason  the mississippi gaming commission could require us to close the hard rock biloxi 
failure to maintain such approvals could prevent or delay the completion of reconstruction or opening of the hard rock biloxi  or otherwise affect the design and features of the operation of the hard rock biloxi  all of which could materially and adversely affect financial position and results of operations 
delays in obtaining governmental authorizations could adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development projects 
our real estate development business requires numerous governmental approvals  licenses and permits  which we must obtain before we can begin development and construction 
this approval process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals  by litigation and appeals challenging development rights and by changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws that may require additional approvals 
adverse regulatory changes or failure to obtain approvals could delay real estate development projects or make them more costly to complete 
changes in mortgage interest rate levels or changes in consumer lending practices could reduce consumer affordability and demand for some of our real estate development projects 
certain of our real estate development projects are dependent upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing for potential homebuyers 
any significant increase in the prevailing low mortgage interest rate environment or decrease in available credit could reduce consumer demand for housing  which in turn could lead to fewer home sales or lower selling prices 
the company s current and future investment in sangart is subject to certain regulatory risks and costs  as well as risks associated with the operation of a new business without a proven track record 
sangart s clinical trials are expensive and time consuming  and sangart cannot be certain that the results of its trials will be acceptable to the regulatory authorities or that they won t be required to conduct new or expanded trials 
sangart s activities are subject to extensive government regulation and sangart cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products 
even if regulatory approvals are received  sangart would be a new business and will be subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business  in addition to the risks associated with establishing the appropriate infrastructure necessary to operate and manage the commercial exploitation of sangart s products 
sangart s hemospan product is subject to competition from other products under development 
there are other companies developing products for the same market that sangart is targeting  and if they are successful in bringing their product to market before sangart it may significantly impair sangart s ability to compete in the same market segment 
sangart s success depends on its ability to obtain  maintain and defend patent protection for its products and technologies  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies  such as sangart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if sangart s intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if sangart fails to maintain its third party intellectual property licenses in good standing  its ability to successfully bring hemospan to market would be adversely affected 
there can be no guarantee that any of sangart s pending patent applications will result in issued patents  or that any patents issued to sangart or its licensors will not be challenged  circumvented or invalidated by third parties 
if sangart loses challenges to its intellectual property it could incur monetary liabilities  be required to enter into third party licenses for the infringed product or technology if available or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
a decrease in consumer spending or general increases in the cost of living could adversely impact sales at our wineries 
our wineries primarily produce and sell wines in the luxury segment of the premium table wine market  and are significantly dependent on the level of consumer spending 
consumer spending habits are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control  including the general state of the economy  increases in the cost of living  federal and state income tax rates  deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state law and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
we could experience significant increases in operating costs due to competition for qualified personnel in our operating businesses 
our inability to attract and retain skilled personnel would make it difficult to compete and operate efficiently 
many of our operating businesses require skilled management and staff employees  we compete for their services with other companies 
our various businesses are dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems 
additionally  we rely on our information systems in managing our accounting and financial reporting 
hardware and software is protected by various forms and levels of security  and certain of our information technology functions have backup processing capabilities 
however  these systems are still vulnerable to fire  storm  flood  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins and similar events 
in the event that critical information systems are unavailable  it could temporarily impair our operations or our ability to maintain our accounting and financial reporting effectively 
we face intense competition in the operation of our businesses 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
there are numerous competitors who operate in our markets  many of which have advantages over us  such as more favorable locations  greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities than we are 
competitors may offer newer or different products or services that our customers may find more attractive 
we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have significant net operating loss carryforwards nols and other tax attributes 
at december   we have recognized a deferred tax asset of  in respect of these tax attributes 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the deferred tax asset 
weather related conditions and significant natural disasters  including hurricanes  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes and hailstorms could adversely affect our business 
the occurrence of natural disasters may impact our wineries  real estate holdings  manufacturing and gaming operations  interfere with our ability to obtain raw materials  sell our products and provide service or realize income from our operations 
any shortage of reliable water and energy resources or a drop in consumer confidence in the dependability of such resources in areas where we operate or own land may adversely affect our business operations  the values of our properties and or result in government restrictions that curtail operations 
we may not be able to insure certain risks economically 
we may experience economic harm if any damage to our properties is not covered by insurance 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim 
we may suffer losses that are not covered under our insurance or reinsurance policies 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur  results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common shares 
on a split adjusted basis  we paid cash dividends of per common share in and 
per common share in and however  we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common shares in the future or  if we do  the amount of such dividends 
the payment of dividends on our common shares in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon general business conditions  the availability of our nols  legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that our board of directors may deem to be relevant 
in connection with the declaration of dividends or the making of distributions on  or the purchase  redemption or other acquisition of our common shares  we are required to comply with certain restrictions contained in certain of our debt instruments 
our common shares are subject to transfer restrictions 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have significant nols and other tax attributes  the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes  our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership including through attribution under the tax law of or more of our common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
the restriction will remain until the earliest of a december   b the repeal of section of the internal revenue code or any comparable successor provision and c the beginning of our taxable year to which these tax attributes may no longer be carried forward 
the restriction may be waived by our board of directors 
shareholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common shares and consult their own legal advisors and or us to determine whether their ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level

item legal proceedings 
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not material to the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
the company is a defendant in special situations fund iii  lp  et al v 
leucadia national corporation  et al  a consolidated action involving a petition for appraisal and a class action pending in the delaware chancery court related to our acquisition of the minority interest in mk resources company mk resources 
the pending appraisal petition seeks a judicial determination of the fair value of approximately  shares of mk resources common stock as of august   the date of the merger of one of our subsidiaries into mk resources 
the class action complaint seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  costs  disbursements and any further relief that the court may deem just and proper  and in the alternative  seeks rescissory damages  in each case taking into account the per share consideration paid to the minority stockholders of mk resources in the merger 
based on discovery to date  we understand that the plaintiffs believe that the fair value of each share of mk resources common stock at the date of the merger ranged from to per share with respect to a total of approximately  shares  while we believe that the fair value of each mk resources share at that date was per share 
the trial in this case is currently scheduled for march  while there can be no assurance that the company will prevail  the company believes that the material allegations of the complaints are without merit and intends to defend these actions vigorously 
while the company does not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred  if the company is unsuccessful in this matter  an adverse determination could be material 
from time to time in the future the company may also be named as a defendant in other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business which  if determined adversely  could result in material liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

liquidity and capital resources parent company liquidity leucadia national corporation the parent is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents and other non controlling investments in debt and equity securities 
the parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value 
accordingly  further acquisitions  divestitures  investments and changes in capital structure are possible 
its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources  liquid investments  bank borrowings  public and private capital market transactions  repayment of subsidiary advances  funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments  management and other fees  and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs 
securities classified as current and non current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents  but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a short period of time 
as of december   the sum of these amounts aggregated  however  since  of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements  represents investments in non public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements which restrict the company s ability to use the funds for other purposes including the inmet shares  the company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the parent s liquidity needs 
the  that is available is comprised of cash and short term bonds and notes of the us government and its agencies  us government sponsored enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities 
the investment income realized from the parent s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the parent company s short term recurring cash requirements  which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses

on september   premier and its subsidiary filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of title of the bankruptcy code

hurricane katrina completely destroyed the hard rock biloxi s casino  which was a facility built on floating barges  and caused significant damage to the hotel and related structures

in july  premier purchased a new insurance policy providing up to  in coverage for damage to real and personal property and up to the lesser of six months or  of business interruption and delayed opening coverage 
the coverage is syndicated through several insurance carriers  each with an am best rating of a excellent or better 
the policy provides coverage for the existing structures  as well as for the repair and rebuild of the hotel  low rise building and parking garage and the construction of the new casino 
although the insurance policy is an all risk policy  weather catastrophe occurrence wco  which is defined to include damage caused by a named storm  is limited to  with a deductible equal to the greater of  or of total insured values at risk 
wco coverage is subject to mandatory reinstatement of coverage for an additional pre determined premium 
premier s current insurance policy expires in july  premier expects it will purchase new insurance coverage that will be in effect for the balance of the hurricane season 
premiums for wco policies have increased dramatically as a result of hurricane katrina  and the amount of coverage that can be purchased has also been reduced as insurance companies seek to reduce their exposure to such events 
premier cannot currently estimate how much insurance will be available to it at an acceptable premium

the company s debt instruments require maintenance of minimum tangible net worth  limit distributions to shareholders and limit indebtedness and funded debt as such terms are defined in the agreements 
in addition  the debt instruments contain limitations on investments  liens  contingent obligations and certain other matters 
the company is in compliance with all of these restrictions  and the company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company require that collateral be provided to the lender  principally as a result of such requirements  the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the company were approximately  at december  for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the estimated interest expense on long term debt includes estimated interest related to variable rate debt which the company determined using rates in effect at december  estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at december  amounts related to the company s consolidated pension liability  are included in the table primarily during the year period  however  the exact timing of the cash payments is uncertain 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees referred to as the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in these plans have been frozen  future changes to the benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates 
during  the company contributed  to these plans  and expects to make substantial additional contributions to the segregated trust accounts in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plans 
the tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration  principally due to the availability of the company s nols to otherwise reduce taxable income 
the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain  however  the company believes it will make substantial additional contributions over the next few years to reduce  but not to entirely eliminate  its defined pension benefit plan liability 
the company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to  and wiltel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of wiltel 
as of december   certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below dollars in thousands caption the company s wiltel s plans plans 
del projected benefit obligation   funded status balance sheet liability at december    deferred losses included in other comprehensive income   discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation del 
calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
for the company s plans  a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis  using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants 
for the wiltel plans  the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market  adjusted for current rates which might be available for annuity settlements 
these discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in these discount rates would affect pension expense by  and the benefit obligation by  the deferred losses in other comprehensive income primarily result from changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates  changes in interest credit rates and differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  for all plans 
a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during  based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating  pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was   of which expires in   in   in and the remainder in subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
substantially all of these letters of credit expire before as discussed above  the company has also guaranteed of the amounts outstanding under clc s  senior secured credit facility and clc s euro  senior secured bridge credit facility 
at december    was outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and euro  was outstanding under the senior secured bridge credit facility  as a result  the company s outstanding guaranty at that date was  and euro   at exchange rates in effect on february   respectively 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period 
similarly  if in the future the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
the determination of the amount of the valuation allowance required is based  in significant part  upon the company s projection of future taxable income at any point in time 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
during  the company s projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense 
the company s conclusion that a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized is strongly influenced by its historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income 
the company s estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its current operations and investments  includes an aggregation of individual projections for each material operation and investment  and includes all future years that the company estimated it would have available net operating losses 
the company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain  and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income greater than the projected amounts  further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible 
conversely  if the company realizes unforeseen material losses in the future  or its ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced  additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded 
at december   the balance of the deferred valuation allowance was approximately  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company did not recognize any impairment losses on long lived assets during  however  during an impairment loss of  was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of wiltel s former headquarters facility to its estimated fair value in connection with the sale of wiltel to level classified with gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
wiltel s former headquarters building  including the adjacent parking garage  was not included in the sale to level and has been retained by the company 
the company concluded that the change in the manner in which the asset was being used  from a headquarters facility of an operating subsidiary to a property held for investment  was a change in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of the facility might not be recoverable 
impairment of securities investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value 
the write downs are included in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and other factors specific to the individual investment 
the company s assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly  actual results may differ materially from the company s estimates and judgments 
the company recorded impairment charges for securities of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of independent appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the company believes relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss  however  under gaap the methods  assumptions and results of an impairment review are not the same for all long lived assets 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
purchase price allocations for all of the company s recent acquisitions have been finalized 
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
as of december   the company s accrual for contingent losses was not material 
results of operations manufacturing idaho timber revenues and other income for idaho timber for the year ended december  and from the date of acquisition may through december  were  and  respectively  gross profits were  and  respectively  salaries and incentive compensation expenses were  and  respectively  depreciation and amortization expenses were  and  respectively  and pre tax income was  and  respectively 
idaho timber s revenues weakened during  reflecting lower average selling prices and reduced shipment volume 
this decline was principally due to weakening demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of lumber in the marketplace 
in october  the trade dispute between the us and canada over canadian lumber imports was resolved and a new softwood lumber agreement became effective that restricts and imposes a tax on canadian lumber imports 
prior to the effective date of that agreement  imports from canada increased  which added to the oversupply in the market 
while raw material costs  the largest component of cost of sales approximately of cost of sales  declined during due to the continued decline in market conditions and the diminished uncertainty concerning the impact of the softwood lumber agreement  this reduction lagged behind the reduction in selling prices 
the difference between idaho timber s selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet spread is closely monitored  and the rate of change in pricing and cost is typically not the same 
during  spreads compressed negatively impacting gross profit and pre tax results 
with the continued oversupply in the market  idaho timber intends to continue to focus on developing new higher margin products  diversifying its supply chain  improving cost control and solidifying customer and supplier relationships  in an effort to maximize gross margins and pre tax results 
manufacturing conwed plastics pre tax income for conwed plastics was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
its manufacturing revenues were   and  and gross profits were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues increased by in  in and in  each as compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenues in reflects  of increased revenues from the acquisitions of nsw in february and polynet in may  which increased the segment s product offerings and customer base 
in addition  revenues reflect increases in the erosion control  carpet cushion and turf reinforcement markets  partially reduced by a decline in the consumer products market due to lower demand for certain products 
these changes result from a variety of factors including the impact of price increases implemented in  increased road construction and using a new distributor for certain products 
while the carpet cushion market continued to benefit from the previously strong housing market through the first half of  it experienced a reduction in sales volume during the second half of the year resulting from a slowdown in housing starts 
the increase in revenues in as compared to reflects nsw s revenues since acquisition of  and increases in most of the segment s markets 
sales increases resulted from a variety of factors including the strong housing market  new products developed late in  and the impact of price increases implemented during the second half of and in the first and fourth quarters of raw material costs increased by approximately in as compared to  and in as compared to  however  the segment was able to increase selling prices in most markets  which  along with increased sales and production volumes  resulted in greater gross margins in each period as compared to the immediately preceding period 
the primary raw material in conwed plastics products is a polypropylene resin  which is a byproduct of the oil refining process  whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil 
there is relatively little direct labor or other raw material costs in the products 
in addition to managing resin purchases  conwed plastics also has initiatives to reduce and or reuse scrap  thereby increasing raw material utilization 
in addition  gross margin and pre tax results for reflect  of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and depreciation expense 
pre tax results for also reflect  of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense than  due principally to greater pre tax profits and increased headcount 
in  gross margins and pre tax results reflect  of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions as compared to in addition  pre tax results for include higher salaries  incentive compensation expense and sales commissions as compared to  primarily related to nsw 
domestic real estate pre tax income for the domestic real estate segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pre tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment s operating properties  the current status of the company s real estate development projects and non recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold 
as a result  pre tax income for this segment for any particular year is not predictable and does not follow any consistent pattern 
pre tax income for principally reflects the sale by square  which resulted in a pre tax gain of  and the sale of other land parcels in utah for a pre tax gain of  in addition  the company recognized pre tax profit related to its lot development project in south walton county  florida of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such amounts principally result from the completion of certain required improvements to land previously sold 
pre tax results for reflect  of incentive compensation accruals related to the company s real estate development project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
in  the company sold lots of its lot development project in south walton county  florida for aggregate sales proceeds of approximately  recognized pre tax profits of  and deferred recognition of pre tax profits of  in addition  revenues during reflect the sale of certain unimproved land for cash proceeds of  which resulted in a pre tax gain of  pre tax results for also reflect due diligence expenses for a real estate development project that the company decided not to develop 
medical product development pre tax losses net of minority interest for sangart for the year ended december  and from the date of acquisition through december  sangart was acquired in november were  and  respectively 
sangart s losses for and for the period from acquisition through december  reflect research and development costs of  and  respectively  and salaries and incentive compensation expenses of  and  respectively 
as more fully discussed above  sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales 
since  it has been developing its current product candidate  hemospan  and is currently conducting clinical trials in the us a phase ii trial and europe two phase iii trials 
it does not expect to complete its clinical trials until  and if they are successful it will then seek approval with the appropriate regulatory authorities to market its product 
until such time  if ever  that sangart obtains regulatory approval for hemospan  the company will report losses from this segment 
us or foreign regulatory agencies could also require sangart to perform more clinical trials  which could be both expensive and time consuming 
the company is unable to predict with certainty when  if ever  it will report operating profits for this segment 
when the company increases its investment in sangart  which it expects to do in march  the additional investment will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the price paid is allocated to sangart s individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values  in sangart s case  substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is initially allocated to research and development 
however  since gaap does not permit the recognition of research and development as an asset under the purchase method  any amounts initially allocated to research and development are immediately expensed 
these amounts are expected to be material 
banking and lending as stated previously  the company s banking and lending operations have been in run off  and during the company s banking and lending subsidiary filed a formal plan with the office of the comptroller of the currency to liquidate its operations  sold its remaining customer deposits and surrendered its national bank charter

during  the company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios representing approximately of its total outstanding loans net of unearned finance charges and certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written off for aggregate pre tax gains of  which is reflected in investment and other income 
corporate and other operations investment and other income increased in as compared to primarily due to greater interest income of  reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates  a  gain from the sales of two associated companies and  from the recovery of bankruptcy claims 
investment and other income in includes a gain of  on the sale of of the company s interest in clc to inmet 
investment and other income increased in as compared to primarily due to the clc gain  greater investment income of  reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates  and increased sales at the wineries of  investment and other income in reflects a pre tax gain of  from the sale of two of the company s older corporate aircraft 
available corporate cash is generally invested on a short term basis until such time as investment opportunities require an expenditure of funds 
net securities gains for corporate and other operations aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s net securities gains largely reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as corporate available for sale securities 
included in net securities gains for is a gain of  from the sale of level common stock 
included in net securities gains for is a gain of  from the sale of  shares of wmig common stock 
net securities gains for  and include provisions of   and  respectively  to write down the company s investments in certain available for sale securities 
the write down of the securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary 
the company s decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security s value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future 
the decision could also be influenced by the status of the company s tax attributes or liquidity needs  however  sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations 
therefore  the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year 
the increase in interest expense during as compared to primarily reflects interest expense relating to premier prior to its deconsolidation and the fixed rate repurchase agreements 
the increase in interest expense during as compared to primarily reflects interest expense relating to  principal amount of senior notes and  principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in april salaries and incentive compensation expense did not significantly change in as compared to as a result of the adoption of sfas r in  the company recorded  for share based compensation expense relating to grants made under the company s senior executive warrant plan and the fixed stock option plan
