item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sources of revenues 
delivery platform we have developed and deployed a customized information technology infrastructure to efficiently and securely deliver our services 
our redundant systems reduce the risk of data loss and transmission failure and allow us to quickly scale to meet increased demand 
key components of our infrastructure include the following 
hub and spoke architecture 
our data centers located in the united states and the philippines use a technical infrastructure designed to facilitate rapid expansion and consistency in delivering services to and from any of our outsourcing centers 
our data centers are connected to each other using multiple  redundant communication lines  which are dedicated international private lines ipls 
our hub and spoke operating model allows us to provide consistent and scalable business processes across multiple outsourcing centers 
applications and data are stored at our data center hubs in the united states and deployed at our spokes offshore 
this allows us to quickly and efficiently handle additional volume and services for our new and existing clients and to expand our outsourcing network by establishing new spokes virtually anywhere in the world that is accessible with a fiber optic network 
robust data security 
we use several layers of information security protection  including applications and devices designed to prevent unauthorized access to data residing in our systems and aggressive monitoring of audit trails at application and network layers 
all outside connections to our network must pass through a sophisticated security system that is supported by multiple firewalls 
data access to client back end systems is also protected by these security measures 
we constantly monitor the network for attacks by potential hackers 
as required by our clients  we apply best practices to prevent our professionals from copying or transmitting customer data 
dedicated telecommunications network 
we have designed and deployed a dedicated telecommunications system which enables us to securely route multi channel communications between the united states and our 
table of contents offshore outsourcing centers 
our system transmits communications traffic with minimal latency and high transmission quality over a private network leased from major telecommunications providers 
our lease agreements with these providers generally provide for annual terms and fixed fees based on the levels of capacity dedicated to our usage 
customer traffic is initially received by one of our us data centers where we seamlessly route calls to the optimal location in the philippines or costa rica based on our professionals skill sets and availability 
in most cases  these communications between the united states and our offshore centers are indistinguishable from domestic communications between points within the united states 
integrated customer communications channels 
we provide customer management services through multiple communications channels  including inbound telephone calls  e mail and webchats 
our customer management professionals are trained to offer services through each of these communications channels 
our customer interaction systems are also integrated with our workforce management system  which is used to manage optimal staffing and service levels 
these systems are all linked to a proprietary reporting system that is updated hourly for all interactions occurring in our outsourcing centers 
this provides our clients with a single view of all interactions between our professionals and their customers 
we also offer real time reporting capabilities to our clients 
proprietary integrated intellicenter feedback system 
intellicenter is our proprietary reporting and analytical system that generates client specific interaction reports 
these reports are accessible to our clients on an hourly  daily  weekly and monthly basis 
intellicenter also provides access to customer contact transcripts and allows our clients to review the customer interaction database of all e mail and webchat transcripts 
the system provides historical trend information to help clients monitor the volume and effectiveness of our interactions with customers 
client helpdesk 
we have a helpdesk staffed  which offers our clients complete coverage in the event of any system issues 
we have established standardized procedures to identify  track  categorize and prioritize inquiries by order of importance to our clients 
we also operate an information technology calling tree which allows us to escalate issues up the personnel chain of command as the situation warrants 
quality assurance 
our quality assurance analysts use our quality management software to monitor service level compliance and randomly sample customer interactions 
the system is configured for voice  data and computer screen capture to record the total customer experience and provide live monitoring and playback via a web browser from any location 
sales and marketing we market our services through our sales and marketing organization  which is divided into sales and marketing support  client development and client services 
sales and marketing support our sales and marketing support group is primarily responsible for increasing the awareness of our services in the marketplace and generating meetings with prospective clients through leads  sales calls  membership in industry associations  web based marketing  public relations activity  attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events 
our sales and marketing support group also maintains contact with industry analysts and tracks competitor and industry information 
these efforts allow us to stay abreast of trends in our target vertical industries 
we plan to increase the number of personnel in our sales and marketing support group in client development our client development group consists of experienced sales directors responsible for initiating relationships and closing engagements with the prospective clients identified by our sales and marketing support group 
this group uses specific industry expertise and knowledge of our service delivery capabilities to develop client relationships  help define the scope  deliverables and execution strategies for proposals  
table of contents prepare pricing estimates and margin analysis for proposed client contracts  finalize sales proposals and assist in the negotiation and closing of new client engagements  and assist in the negotiation and closing of new client arrangements 
sales directors work closely with our consulting services group  and we plan to increase the size and capabilities of our client development team in client services after our sales directors have successfully closed an engagement  a client services manager from our services group is assigned to the client 
sales directors maintain high level client relationships 
client services managers are primarily responsible for managing the day to day aspects of our client relationships  as well as expanding the existing relationships and assuring client satisfaction 
they also develop a strong understanding of our clients business models and needs 
client services managers work with our clients to identify potential new business opportunities  based on their assessment of the clients and trends in their specific industry 
our sales directors and client services managers work as a team to understand and communicate our clients strategic business needs  align our offerings and services to meet our clients long term objectives and help grow our relationships at multiple levels within our clients organizations 
employees at december   we had approximately  employees with approximately  employees in the philippines  in costa rica and in the united states 
as of the date of this filing we had added more than  employees  primarily in the philippines  and now have more than  employees 
all of our employees sign confidentiality agreements 
in addition  our employees in the philippines sign employment agreements containing non compete provisions 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
hiring and recruiting we recognize that our professionals are critical to the success of our business as a majority of our support and service efforts involve direct interaction with customers 
we believe the tenure and productivity of our professionals are directly related 
attracting  hiring  training and retaining our professionals are major areas of focus 
nearly all of our philippine based professionals are college educated 
we pay our professionals competitive wages and offer a benefits program that includes comprehensive medical  dental and life insurance  meal allowance  overtime pay and paid time off  as well as a variety of employee incentives including a retirement benefit plan 
additionally  in a compensation component uncommon for the philippine labor market  we award equity incentives to certain of our tenured professionals  which are subject to vesting based on continued service 
we believe we have developed effective strategies and a strong track record in recruiting 
we created an applicant information management system to receive applications through the internet and track the progress of our applicants 
successful candidates must undergo numerous tests and interviews before we extend offers for employment 
we also have an active employee referral program that provides us with a cost effective way of accessing qualified candidates 
competition we encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activities 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include the ability to provide high quality professionals with strong customer interaction skills  including english language fluency with minimal accents  offer cost effective pricing of services  deliver value added and reliable solutions to clients  provide industry specific knowledge and expertise  
table of contents generate revenues for clients  secure our client s confidential data  and provide a technology platform that offers a seamless customer experience 
we believe that we compete effectively on all of these factors 
in providing outsourcing services to us based clients  we believe the location from which services are performed is also a competitive factor 
us companies may use domestic providers of outsourcing services or keep additional work in house  despite the additional cost savings available through offshore providers of these services 
the global bpo services companies with whom we compete include both offshore and us based companies 
these offshore companies may be based in locations such as india  the philippines  south america  china  latin america  the caribbean  africa or eastern europe 
we position ourselves as a philippine based outsourcing provider  with high quality service offerings and a college educated workforce attuned to us culture  and with an emphasis on lower cost structure and revenue generation for our clients 
in customer management services  our principal competitors include publicly traded us companies ibm global services  sykes enterprises  convergys corporation  west corp  wns global services  exlservice holdings  inc and teletech holdings 
privately held competitors include etelecare international and clientlogic 
in addition to our direct competitors  many companies choose to perform some or all of their customer service  technical support  collections and back office processes internally 
their employees provide these services as part of their regular business operations 
some companies have moved portions of their in house customer management functions offshore  including to offshore affiliates 
we believe our key advantage over in house business processes is that we give companies the opportunity to focus on their core products and services while we focus on the specialized function of managing their customer relationships  transcriptions and captioning and additional back office services 
proprietary rights our principal intellectual property consists of our company logo hand design  the trademarks peoplesupport  the power of experience  recovery with respect and rapidtext which are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
we do not hold any patents and we do not have any other registered trademarks or copyrights 
we do rely on proprietary software  including our intellicenter reporting portal and the know how of our management 
to establish and protect our other intellectual property rights  we rely on common law protection of copyrights  trademarks  and trade secrets  as well as confidentiality agreements used during the course of business 
we consider our business processes and implementation methodologies confidential  proprietary information constituting trade secrets 
customers and business partners sign a nondisclosure agreement requiring confidential treatment of our information 
our employees are also required to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition to their employment 
we have non compete agreements with our employees in the philippines 
regulation our corporate legal department manages general corporate legal matters  including contract and document preparation and review  regulatory and statutory compliance  collections  obtaining and maintaining multi state licensing  bonding and insurance  dispute and complaint resolution and litigation management 
we have attorneys based in los angeles and manila  qualified in us and philippine law  respectively 
federal  state and international laws and regulations impose a number of requirements and restrictions on our business 
for example  our accounts receivable management services are subject to the fair debt collection practices act  which imposes numerous restrictions and obligations on our debt collection practice 
additionally  many states require a debt collector to apply for  be granted and maintain a license to engage in debt collection activities within the state 
there are state and federal consumer protection laws that apply to our customer management services business  such as laws limiting telephonic sales or mandating special disclosures  and laws 
table of contents that apply to information that may be captured  used  shared and or retained when sales are made and or collections are attempted 
state and federal laws also impose limits on credit account interest rates and fees  and their disclosure  as well as the time frame in which judicial actions may be initiated to enforce the collection of consumer accounts 
there are numerous other federal  state  local and even international laws and regulations related to  among other things  privacy  identity theft  telephonic and electronic communications  sharing and use of consumer information that apply to our business and to our employees interactions and communications with others 
for example  the federal trade commission s telemarketing sales rule applies a number of limitations and restrictions on our ability to make outbound calls on behalf of our clients and our ability to encourage customers to purchase higher value products and services on inbound calls 
similarly  the telephone consumer protection act of  which among other things governs the use of certain automated calling technologies  applies to calls to customers 
many states also have telemarketing laws that may apply to our business  even if the call originates from outside the state 
additionally  some of the laws directed toward credit originators  such as the truth in lending act and the fair credit billing act  can affect our operations because our receivables were originated through credit transactions 
these laws  among others  may give consumers a legal cause of action against us or may limit our ability to recover amounts owed with respect to the receivables 
federal and state regulators are empowered to examine and take enforcement actions for violations of these laws and regulations or for practices  policies or procedures they deem non compliant  unfair  unsafe or unsound 
moreover  lawsuits may be brought by appropriate regulatory agencies  attorneys general and private parties for non compliance with these laws and regulations 
accordingly  a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on us 
new consumer protection and privacy protection laws or regulations are likely to impose additional requirements on the enforcement of and recovery on consumer credit card or installment accounts  telephonic sales  internet communications and other portions of our business 
we cannot ensure that some of the receivables were not established as a result of identity theft or unauthorized use of credit and  accordingly  we will not be able to recover the amount of these and other defaulted consumer receivables 
as a purchaser of defaulted consumer receivables  we may acquire receivables subject to legitimate defenses on the part of the consumer 
in general  our account purchase contracts allow us to return to the debt seller certain defaulted consumer receivables that may not be collectible  due to these and other circumstances 
upon return  the debt sellers are required to replace the receivables with similar receivables or repurchase the receivables 
these provisions limit  to some extent  our potential losses on such accounts 
our transcription business in the medical services area is governed in part by the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  a federal law that governs the storage and protection of patient data 
the transcriptionists we use to type patient reports are trained in the appropriate handling of patient data as defined under hipaa

item a 
risk factors set forth below  elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in other documents we file with the sec are important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations  business and financial condition to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
you should consider carefully the following risk factors before deciding whether to invest in our common stock 
our business  including our operating results and financial condition  could be harmed by any of these risks 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may 
table of contents materially and adversely affect our business 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the sec  including our financial statements and related notes 
risks related to our business our revenues are highly dependent upon several major clients  and any loss of business from our major clients would reduce our revenues and seriously harm us 
for the three months period ended december   our three largest clients  earthlink  expedia and washington mutual  accounted for of our revenues  and our customer concentration has been even higher for prior periods 
for the twelve months ended december   our three largest clients  expedia  earthlink and vonage  accounted for of our revenues 
if we fail to renew or extend our contracts with our clients  or if these contracts are terminated for cause or convenience  our clients will have no obligation to purchase services from us 
our clients may from time to time conduct a request for proposal  or rfp  process to solicit bids for outsourcing services  including from our competitors  and we may not be successful in retaining or expanding our relationship with this client 
vonage recently went through such an rfp process  as a result  of which they elected not to renew their current contract with us and allow it to expire in may in  and  our revenues from vonage were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
it is unlikely the lost revenue from a major client would be entirely offset by corresponding reductions in expenses 
any reduction in revenues would harm our business  negatively affect operating results  and may lead to a decline in the price of our common stock 
our revenues are highly dependent on a few industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries would likely reduce our revenues and seriously harm our business 
our major clients are concentrated in the travel and hospitality  financial services  technology  telecommunications and consumer products industries 
increased competition  consolidation  a downturn  or a reversal of the trend toward outsourcing in any of these industries  would likely result in a decrease in the demand for our services or the cancellation or non renewal of existing contracts 
in addition  we are dependent in large part on the projected growth of these industries  which may not materialize 
these industries have been cyclical and vulnerable to significant downturns in the past  and adverse developments in these industries could unfavorably affect our business 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and could cause the market price of our common stock to fall rapidly and without notice 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
in particular  demand for the services or products of our major clients in the travel and hospitality industry typically drops in the fourth quarter as compared to other periods  and therefore the need for our services is reduced as well 
recent results of operations should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
in addition  our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially  either suddenly or over time 
a reversal of industry trends toward offshore outsourcing due to negative public reaction in the united states would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate facilities located in the united states 
our revenues and growth depend in large part on us industry trends towards outsourcing customer management and other business processes offshore 
the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse 
there has been recent publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that use offshore outsourcing  particularly in india 
current or prospective clients may elect to perform services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services to offshore providers to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with using an offshore provider 
our risk is compounded by the fact that the majority of bpo services we provide involve interaction with the general public eg  our clients customers  which may be more sensitive to negative public reaction to offshore outsourcing 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors who operate out of facilities located in the united states 

table of contents we serve markets that are highly competitive  and increased competition  our inability to compete successfully against current or future competitors  pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in increased costs and reduced operating margins 
we currently face significant competition from our clients and our potential clients in house customer service groups and growing competition from other bpo companies  including those in the united states  the philippines  india and elsewhere 
we expect this competition to continue to increase 
new competitors may include entrants from the communications  software and data networking industries or entrants from other geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate 
these companies also may have greater financial  personnel and other resources  longer operating histories  more recognizable brand names and more established client relationships 
many of these companies compete with us primarily on price and are often able to offer lower costs to potential clients 
many of our contracts can be terminated by our clients on short notice and in many cases without penalty 
we also generally do not have exclusive arrangements with our clients or a minimum revenue commitment from our clients  which creates uncertainty about the volume of services we will provide and the amount of revenues we will generate from any of our clients 
many of our clients could terminate their relationship with us or significantly reduce their demand for our services due to a variety of factors  including factors that are unpredictable and outside of our control 
in addition  in many cases  we are not the exclusive provider of outsourcing services to our clients 
the services we provide to a client could be reduced for a variety of reasons  including our client s decision to move more customer management functions in house  or to an affiliated outsourcing provider or one of our competitors  changing economic factors  internal financial challenges or political or public relations reasons 
any significant reduction in client demand for our service would harm our business  negatively affect operating results and would likely lead to a decline in the price of our common stock 
we often encounter a long sales and implementation cycle requiring significant resource commitments by our clients  which they may be unwilling or unable to make 
the sales and implementation of our customer management services involves significant resource commitments by us and our clients 
we generally expend substantial time and money addressing potential clients service and operational questions and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
decisions relating to outsourcing business processes generally involve the evaluation of the service by our clients senior management and a significant number of client personnel in various functional areas  each having specific and often conflicting requirements 
we may expend significant resources  including funds and management time  during the sales cycle 
ultimately  the client may not engage our services or may cancel services before we have recovered the resources expended during the sales and implementation cycle  which may range from six to twelve months or longer 
unsuccessful or delayed sales and implementations may negatively impact our revenues and margins 
we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future 
we did not become profitable until and incurred significant losses in each of the five fiscal years through as a result of our operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  further  we expect our marketing  sales and other operating expenses to increase in the future as we seek to expand our business 
if our revenues do not grow at a faster rate than these expected increases in our expenses  or if our operating expenses are higher than we anticipate  we may not be profitable and we may incur additional losses 
we have a limited operating history and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 
we have a limited operating history 
we consolidated our operations in the philippines in and  and commenced our accounts receivable management services in july we acquired our transcription and captioning business in january we began developing new bpo facilities in costa rica in the first quarter of as a result of our recent entry into these markets  our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 

table of contents we are also exploring opportunities to provide other outsourced services that we have not provided to date 
you should consider the challenges  risks  and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies using new and unproven business models in rapidly evolving markets 
these challenges include our ability to attract and retain clients  attract and retain key personnel and qualified professionals  generate sufficient revenues and manage costs to maintain profitability  integrate acquisitions  adjust to new businesses and develop operating procedures for new countries  manage growth in our operations  and access additional capital when required and on reasonable terms 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  the quality of our services may decline  our revenue and margins may be reduced and we may incur losses 
we have expanded significantly since our formation and intend to maintain our growth focus 
continued growth could place a strain on our management  operations and financial resources 
our infrastructure  facilities and personnel may not be adequate to support our future operations or to adapt effectively to our growth 
as a result  we may be unable to manage our growth effectively  in which case the quality of our services may decrease and clients may become dissatisfied and reduce demand for our services 
as a result  our operating costs may increase at a faster rate than the growth in our revenues  our margins may decline and we may incur losses 
we may experience significant employee turnover rates in the future and we may be unable to hire and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations  which could harm our business 
the business process outsourcing industry is very labor intensive and our success depends on our ability to attract  hire and retain qualified employees 
we focus in particular on recruiting college educated personnel and compete for candidates with companies in our industry and in other industries 
as the bpo industry expands in the philippines  this competition is increasing 
our growth requires that we continually hire and train new personnel 
the bpo industry  including the customer management services industry  has traditionally experienced high employee turnover 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiency and productivity  and could lead to a decline in demand for our services 
if this were to occur  we would be unable to service our clients effectively and this would reduce our ability to continue our growth and operate profitably 
our senior management team is important to our continued success and the loss of members of senior management could negatively affect our operations 
the loss of the services of lance rosenzweig  our chief executive officer  caroline rook  our chief financial officer  or rainerio borja  our president of peoplesupport philippines  inc  as well as other executive personnel  could seriously impair our ability to continue to manage and expand our business 
our success depends on the continued service and performance of our executive officers  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain these individuals 
our executive officers are at will employees who are not subject to employment agreements providing for any specified term of employment 
we do not have key man insurance  nor are our us based executive officers subject to non compete restrictions 
our facilities are at risk of damage by earthquake  typhoons  tsunamis and other natural disasters 
we are dependent on our facilities in southern california  the philippines and costa rica to provide service and support to our clients 
these facilities are located in regions that are susceptible to earthquakes and other natural disasters  including  in the philippines  typhoons and volcanic eruptions 
these dangers increase the risk of disruption of information systems and telephone service for sustained periods 
damage or destruction that interrupts our ability to perform outsourcing services could damage our relationship with our clients and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to provide alternative services to repair or replace damaged equipment or facilities 
table of contents and may subject us to penalties during such disruption 
prolonged disruption of our services as a result of natural disasters may entitle our clients to terminate their contracts with us 
our insurance policies specifically exclude certain natural disasters  such as earthquakes  and may not be sufficient even if we do have coverage 
furthermore  we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage or to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future 
our operations could suffer from telecommunications or technology downtime  disruptions or increased costs 
we are highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems 
in the normal course of our business  we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to access  maintain and expand the databases we use for our services 
we are also dependent on continuous availability of voice and electronic communication with customers 
if we experience interruptions of our telecommunications network with our clients  we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues 
these disruptions could be the result of natural disasters  errors by our vendors  clients  or third parties  electronic or physical attacks by persons seeking to disrupt our operations  or the operations of our vendors  clients  or others 
for example  we currently depend on a limited number of vendors for facility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at our us data centers 
any failure of these vendors to perform these services could result in business disruptions and impede our ability to provide services to our clients 
we also may be required to pay penalties to our clients 
a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential clients not to use our services 
the temporary or permanent loss of equipment or systems through casualty or operating malfunction could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we could cause disruptions to our clients business from inadequate service  and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover this risk 
most of our contracts with our clients contain service level and performance requirements  including requirements relating to the timing and quality of responses to customer inquiries 
the quality of services that we provide is measured by quality assurance ratings  which are based in part on the results of customer satisfaction surveys and direct monitoring of interactions between our professionals and customers 
failure to meet service requirements of a client could disrupt the client s business and result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us 
for example  some of our agreements have standards for service that  if not met by us  result in lower payments to us 
in addition  because many of our projects are business critical projects for our clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 
while we maintain commercial liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions  this coverage may be inadequate to cover one or more large claims  and our insurer may deny coverage 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients 
we are typically required to collect and store sensitive data in connection with our services  including names  addresses  social security numbers  medical records  personal credit card account numbers  checking and savings account numbers and payment history records  such as account closures and returned checks 
some of our clients are subject to us federal and state regulations requiring the protection of sensitive customer information  and new legislation could increase the range of possible penalties for certain entities that fail to protect such information 
if any person  including any of our employees  misappropriates or mismanages sensitive data  we could be subject to liability for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws which could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential clients to choose other service providers 

table of contents our clients may adopt technologies that decrease the demand for our services  which could reduce our revenues and seriously harm our business 
our clients may adopt new technologies that decrease the need for live customer interactions  such as interactive voice response  web based self help  voice recognition software for transcription and other technologies used to automate interactions with customers 
the adoption of such technologies could reduce the demand for our services  put downward pressure on our pricing  cause a reduction in our revenues and harm our business 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in the united states may be limited 
we intend to use our us net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the us corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
based on our analysis  which includes assumptions regarding the respective value of our stock  we believe that our net operating losses are subject to limitation under section while no assurance can be given  based on our current analysis we do not anticipate that a section limitation will significantly delay the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 
no assurance can be given  however  that future events including  but not limited to  substantially increased forecast income  impact of acquisitions and significant increases during the applicable testing period in the percentage of our stock owned directly or constructively by i any stockholder who owns or more of our stock or ii some or all of the group of stockholders who individually own less than of our stock will not trigger additional section limitations and  as a result  adversely affect our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited under the rules of section as a result of our november secondary offering or otherwise  our income could be subject to us corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in lower profits 
we may choose to expand operations to other countries and may not be successful 
in the first half of  we began operations in a new bpo center in costa rica 
we may consider expanding to countries other than the philippines and costa rica 
we cannot predict the extent of government support  availability of qualified workers  or monetary and economic conditions in other countries 
although some of these factors will influence our decision to establish operations in another country  there are inherent risks beyond our control  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political uncertainties  foreign exchange restrictions and foreign regulatory restrictions 
one or more of these factors or other factors relating to international operations could result in increased operating expenses and make it more difficult for us to manage our costs and operations  which could harm our business and negatively impact our operating results 
we may make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or divert our resources 
in the first quarter of  we acquired rapidtext  inc and its subsidiary  the transcription company  which added transcription and captioning to our service offerings 
we are still integrating rapidtext into our offshore operating platform 
we intend to consider acquisitions of other companies that could complement our business  including the acquisition of companies with expertise in other businesses and clients that we do not currently serve 
we have little experience in completing acquisitions of other businesses 
we may incur expenses and be unable to successfully complete future acquisitions 
if we acquire other businesses  we may be unable to successfully integrate these businesses with our own and maintain our standards  controls and policies 
acquisitions may place additional constraints on our resources by diverting the attention of our management from existing operations 
through acquisitions  we may enter markets in which we have little or no experience 
any acquisition may result in a potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  all of which could lower our margins and harm our business 

table of contents we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
the bpo industry has become subject to an increasing amount of federal and state regulation in the past five years 
despite our focus on inbound customer management  we are subject to regulations governing communications with consumers due to the activities we undertake on behalf of our clients to encourage customers to purchase higher value  additional or complementary products and services offered by our clients 
for example  the federal trade commission s telemarketing sales rule  issued pursuant to the federal telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act of  applies a number of limitations and restrictions on our sales activities during inbound calls as well as on our ability to make outbound calls on behalf of our clients 
similarly  the telephone consumer protection act of and regulations issued by the federal communications commission restrict various telemarketing practices  including the use of automated dialing technology 
many states also have telemarketing laws that may apply to our business 
a violation of such federal and state regulations could result in civil penalties or lawsuits by consumers  which in turn could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential clients to choose other service providers 
in addition  limits on the transport of personal information across international borders such as those now in place in the european union and proposed elsewhere may limit our ability to obtain customer data 
our clients business operations are subject to certain rules and regulations in the united states  such as the gramm leach bliley act  the hipaa  and the customer privacy provisions of the communications act 
our clients may contractually require that we perform our services in a manner that would enable them to comply with such rules and regulations 
failure to perform our services in compliance with these laws could result in breaches of contract with our clients and  in some limited circumstances  civil fines and criminal penalties for us 
we are also subject to significant federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our accounts receivable management services  including the fair debt collection practices act  which imposes significant limitations and restrictions on our debt collection practices including licensing requirements 
these laws and regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce defaulted consumer receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 
some laws and regulations applicable to credit cards  debit cards  checks and other negotiable items may preclude us from collecting on defaulted consumer receivables we purchase or obtain through contingency placements from originators if they or others failed to comply with applicable laws in generating or servicing those receivables 
additional federal  state  local or international legislation  or changes in regulatory implementation  could further limit our activities or those of our clients in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
new consumer protection and privacy protection laws or regulations are likely to impose additional requirements on the enforcement of and recovery on consumer credit card or installment accounts  telephonic sales  internet communications and other portions of our business 
as a purchaser of defaulted consumer receivables  we may acquire receivables subject to legitimate defenses on the part of the consumer 
new federal and state legislation may be enacted that could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the united states 
complying with new laws and regulations could significantly increase our cost of doing business and adversely impact our financial condition 
our ability to raise capital in the future  if and when needed  may be limited  and could prevent us from executing our business strategy 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in further dilution to our stockholders 
if our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for acquisitions  expansion or other purposes  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain other debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
bank debt or debt securities would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that restrict our operations 
we may be unable to secure financing in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all  in which case we may not have the funds necessary to finance our ongoing capital requirements to execute our business strategy 

table of contents terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economy  disrupt our operations and cause our business to suffer 
the risks of civil unrest and terrorism exists and us companies in particular may experience greater risks 
we are not insured against terrorism risks 
terrorist attacks have the potential to directly impact our clients and the economy by making travel more difficult  interrupting lines of communication and curtailing our ability to deliver our services to our clients 
these obstacles may increase our expenses and harm our business 
risks related to doing business in the philippines we may face competition in the philippines for our professionals  which could increase the cost of qualified employees and the amount of employee turnover 
we are faced with competition in the philippines for outsourcing center professionals  and we expect this competition to increase as additional outsourcing companies  and other companies with a demand for college educated personnel  enter the market and expand their operations 
in particular  there may be limited availability of qualified middle and upper management candidates 
we have benefited from an excess of supply over demand for college graduates in the philippines 
if this favorable imbalance changes due to increased competition  it could affect the availability or cost of qualified professionals  who are critical to our performance 
this could increase our costs and turnover rates 
the philippines periodically experiences political or economic instability  which could disrupt our operations  increase our costs and harm our business 
the philippines continues to experience low growth in its gross domestic product  significant inflation and shortages of foreign exchange 
we are exposed to the risk of rental and other cost increases due to inflation in the philippines  which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the united states 
these conditions could create political or economic instability that could harm businesses operating in the philippines 
in addition  the philippines has and may continue to experience political instability  including strikes  demonstrations  protests  marches  coups d tat  guerilla activity or other types of civil disorder 
potential demonstrations associated with the mid term elections in may could disrupt commerce 
these instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment in the philippines could increase our operational costs  increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in the philippines 
currency fluctuations in the philippine peso relative to the us dollar has increased and could continue to increase our expenses 
all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and paid in philippine pesos 
we are therefore exposed to the risk of an increase in the value of the philippine peso relative to the us dollar 
in and through december   appreciation in the philippine peso has increased our expenses  and future appreciation in the peso will continue to increase expenses 
in january to offset recent declines in the value of the us dollar against the philippine peso  we entered into various forward foreign currency contracts covering approximately million at an average exchange rate of philippine pesos per us dollar 
while we intend for these contracts to decrease the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  they may result in increased fluctuations 
the current tax holidays in the philippines may not be extended 
we currently benefit from income tax holiday incentives in the philippines 
our current income tax holidays expire at staggered dates beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in while we fully intend to apply for extensions of these holidays  it is possible that such extensions could be denied  or that due to changes in the government of the philippines that these holidays could be removed entirely 
should either of these events occur  our philippine tax liability could increase 

table of contents risks related to doing business in costa rica we have limited experience with operations in costa rica and are subject to particular risks associated with the development of operations in costa rica 
costa rica  while regarded as a relatively stable central american country  has been subject to economic and political challenges present in latin america in general and in central america in particular 
costa rica has often experienced high internal and external debt and significant inflation  as well as pressure from political instability in the neighboring central american countries of nicaragua and panama 
economic instabilities and adverse changes in the political environment in costa rica could increase our operational costs  increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in costa rica 
some of the significant risks we face in our costa rican operations include the following we may be unable to find  hire or retain  at rates attractive to us  a sufficient number of qualified employees  currency fluctuations in the costa rican colon relative to the us dollar could significantly increase our expenses  we are dependent on telecommunications service provided by a limited number of available vendors in order to conduct our business  and if the telecommunications service were to fail  experience problems or be interrupted or unreliable  we may be unable to service our client or fulfill our contractual obligations  our facilities are at risk of damage by earthquakes  typhoons and other natural disasters  and we may have overestimated the demand for spanish language bpo services which may not be sufficient to expand our costa rican operations 
our costa rican operations are dependent on a single client  washington mutual  which has the option to acquire the operations from us and therefore deprive us of our presence in latin america 
our costa rican options are dependent on a single financial services client  washington mutual 
under the terms of our contract  washington mutual may acquire our costa rican operations from us with days notice at anytime prior to the expiration of its contract with us in by paying a termination fee that is intended to cover our costs of transferring our operations to washington mutual 
if washington mutual were to acquire the operations from us  we would not have a presence in latin america unless we establish other latin american operations  which could require significant time and new investment 
if washington mutual purchases our costa rican operations from us  this could be a setback in our ability to provide bilingual english spanish services 
in addition  the contract allows a reconciliation of actual allowable costs to invoiced amounts from inception of our services to washington mutual s acquisition of the operations from us 
to the extent that actual allowable costs are less than corresponding invoiced costs  we must repay this overage to washington mutual at that time 
government regulations and various bureaucratic constraints have increased and may continue to increase operational costs in costa rica beyond budgeted expectations 
primarily due to government regulations and various bureaucratic constraints  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  higher than expected costs of doing business in costa rica 
these additional costs may adversely affect our operations  result in delays that cause us to be unable to fulfill our contractual obligations and could have an adverse impact on our financial statements 
current costa rican tax holidays through  from which we benefit  may be changed 
any change or revocation of the current tax holidays may subject us to greater taxes 
risks related to our stock our stock price may be volatile  and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid  or at all 
before our initial public offering  our common stock was not traded in a public market 
since the completion of our initial public offering  our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
we cannot predict the extent to 
table of contents which the trading market will continue to develop or how liquid that market might become 
prices for our common stock could be influenced by a variety of factors  including the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  investor perception of us  our business and our industry  the consumer credit and outsourcing industries  and general economic and market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this risk factors section and elsewhere herein 
in addition  the stock market in general and the nasdaq global market have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
trading prices and valuations may not be sustainable 
broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in addition  following periods of volatility in the overall market and a decline in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
if securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they change negatively their recommendations regarding our stock  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us publishes negative research on us or our industry  or downgrades our stock  as has occurred  our stock price may decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease or limit coverage of us or our industry  or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq global market  has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or discourage business combinations and takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult  expensive or otherwise discourage a tender offer or a change in control or takeover attempt by a third party that is opposed by our board of directors 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in management that stockholders consider favorable 
in particular  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that classify our board of directors into three groups  each of which will serve for staggered three year terms  permit the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors  permit stockholders to remove our directors only for cause  permit a special stockholders meeting to be called only by our chairman of the board of directors  president  or chief executive officer  a majority of our board of directors or two thirds of the independent directors  require stockholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting  permit our board of directors to issue  without approval of our stockholders  up to  shares of preferred stock with terms that our board of directors may determine and that may be senior to the terms of our common stock  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors that would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect directors  
table of contents permit the board of directors to alter certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  require approval of at least of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt  amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or amend or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors and the ability of stockholders to take action  and eliminate the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent 
additionally  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
as of december    shares of our common stock were outstanding and approximately  shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted shares 
as of december   the number of shares of our outstanding common stock freely tradeable on the nasdaq global market and not owned by our officers  directors or other affiliates was approximately  shares 
in addition  we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement on form s authorizing us to issue up to million of public equity or debt in the future  we issued million of that amount on november   and we may offer an additional million under that registration statement 
additional common stock in public or private offerings to raise capital or any stock issuance in connection with an acquisition may result in future sales of stock in the public market 
future sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we were formed in and incorporated in the state of delaware on july of that year 
in october we completed our initial public offering and raised approximately million  net of expenses 
in january  we acquired rapidtext and its subsidiary  the transcription company  for approximately million 
in november we closed a secondary offering that raised  net of expenses  approximately  million 
our revenues have grown from million in to million in during the same period our net income grew from losses of million in and million in to a profit of million in net income for included a million income tax benefit primarily associated with the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
excluding the income tax benefits  the increase in net income was primarily attributable to growth in our customer management business  which enabled us to build revenues  and our move to the philippines  which allowed us to reduce our operating costs  improve our margins and offer cost savings to our clients

in thousands  except per share data revenues income from operations net income basic income per share diluted income per share the decrease in fourth quarter income from operations as compared to the previous quarters was primarily due to the following items which total approximately million increased information technology infrastructure costs and various credits associated with our contract in costa rica with a single anchor client  increased depreciation expense due to overall capacity and infrastructure build  additional amortization related to our software licenses  increased sarbanes oxley compliance and audit costs  increased non cash compensation charges and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
during the year ended december   we assessed the deferred tax asset valuation allowance each quarter and decreased the allowance by million and million in the second and fourth quarters 
the allowance was increased in the third quarter by million  for a net tax effect for all of of million 

table of contents during the year ended december   we assessed the deferred tax asset valuation allowance each quarter and released million  million  million and million in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
quarterly and year to date computations of earnings per share amounts are made independently  therefore  the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with the per share amounts for the year 
sources of revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december   we derived a majority of our revenue from fees  which include time delineated or production based fees  including hourly or per minute charges and charges per interaction or transaction  and training fees  all of which are separately negotiated on an individual client basis  and implementation fees  including revenue associated with the installation and integration of new clients into our telecommunications  information technology and client reporting structures 
we recently revised our pricing with one of our largest clients from a per session fee to an hourly rate 
we believe this will allow us to staff for this client more efficiently 
we do not currently expect this transition to impact revenues or overall margins for this client although the ultimate impact of this change cannot be predicted with certainty 
substantially all of our revenue consisted of time delineated or production based fees 
for the twelve month periods ended december  and  approximately of our revenue was comprised of implementation and training fees 
for the three and twelve month periods ended december  and  substantially all of our revenue was derived from us based clients 
revenue trends our revenue growth is primarily driven by organic growth from sales to new and existing clients 
we believe our sales will continue to increase as we expand our sales team and leverage our success with existing clients 
we believe the increase in sales to existing clients is primarily due to our clients satisfaction with our service and the increase in their demand for our services 
we also expect to increase revenue by expanding into new markets and are looking for opportunities to expand into new geographic areas and new service offerings 
historically  revenue has been concentrated among three clients 
while this percentage has been declining  for the three and twelve month periods ending december   our three largest clients collectively accounted for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
this is a significant reduction from the three and twelve month periods ending december   when our three largest clients collectively accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   three clients  earthlink  expedia and vonage  each accounted for more than of our revenue 
for the three months ended december   four clients  earthlink  expedia  vonage and washington mutual  accounted for more than of our revenue 
for the three and twelve month periods ending december   three clients  expedia  earthlink and consumerinfo 
com  each accounted for more than of our revenue 
we have continued to increase revenues from our largest customers but their percentage of our overall revenues has declined because we have increased our client base 
we expect these percentages to continue their long term decline in as we continue to diversify our customer base 
status of key revenue contracts our contract with expedia expires in september our contract with earthlink expires in january  and will automatically renew each year for a one year period unless terminated by earthlink or us before the end of the term 
our contract with vonage was extended to may and would have automatically renewed  however  vonage elected to end the contract and it will terminate in may although we are in discussions with vonage to continue providing a small portion of the services we currently are performing after our contract expires in may  these discussions may or may not be successful and there is no assurance that we will continue to perform 
table of contents services for vonage 
in   and  our revenues from vonage were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our contracts with washington mutual expire over the course of the next three years 
many of our clients may terminate their contracts with us before their expiration with no penalties or limited penalties or they may refuse to extend their contracts after the contracts expire 
key expense categories cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries  payroll taxes and employee benefit costs paid to the approximately  professionals we employed in the philippines  costa rica and the united states as of december  our employee related costs are primarily incurred in the philippines where we employ approximately  of our personnel 
employee costs  which account for approximately two thirds of our cost of revenues  are paid in the local currency 
because our revenue is in us dollars and most employee related costs are paid in the local currency  we are exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
recently  the philippine peso has strengthened against the dollar  resulting in increased costs 
we are not certain if this strengthening will continue 
with the acquisition of the us based rapidtext and our expansion into costa rica  we are now operating in regions with a higher wage structure than the philippines and increased our compensation expense 
the non employee related portion of our cost of revenues include telecommunications costs  information technology costs  rent expense  facilities support and customer management support costs related to the operation of outsourcing and data centers  and consulting services related to our customer management consulting group in the united states 
cost of revenues do not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenue 
in we continued to strategically invest in expanding our outsourcing delivery capabilities to meet anticipated increases in demand from new and existing clients 
the costs of expansion primarily include compensation and training of additional outsourcing and support personnel  including middle and upper management  rental of facilities and expenses related to tenant improvements and facilities  information technology  telecommunications and transmission rights 
our strategic investments in expanded client service capacity will generally occur ahead of anticipated increases in client demand 
we believe this is necessary for us to be prepared to quickly provide additional high quality services when demand increases  even though we generally do not have specific commitments from existing or prospective clients for increased volume 
as a result  we have experienced  and expect in the future to experience  periods of overcapacity and higher costs of revenues  which we intend will be followed by lower costs of revenues as increases in demand enable us to utilize our expanded capacity 
although our investment in developing client service capacity may result in near term overcapacity and reduced operating margins  we believe the investment is essential to attract and retain additional clients 
the success of this approach depends on our ability to correctly anticipate and continue building demand for our services 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred at our us based corporate headquarters  including sales and administrative employee related expenses  sales commissions  professional fees  information technology costs  travel  costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  marketing programs which include product marketing expenses  corporate communications  conferences and other brand building and advertising and other corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the three and twelve months ended december   as compared with selling  general and administrative expenses for the three and twelve months ended december  we expect these expenses to continue to increase as we add personnel and incur additional fees and costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
because of our growth we continue to invest in both capital and personnel in order to meet our growing infrastructure needs 
while we have recently been able to leverage selling  general and administrative expenses and achieve economies of scale  during this period of investment and growth our expenses may precede the associated revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
we currently purchase substantially all of our equipment 
we record property and equipment at cost and calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets  which range from one to five years 
we amortize leasehold improvements on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
if the actual useful life of any such asset is less than the estimated depreciable life  we would record additional depreciation expense or a loss on disposal to the extent the net book value of such asset is not recovered upon sale 

table of contents restructuring charges 
from to  we reorganized to reduce future operating costs by streamlining operations and moving to lower cost operating centers in the philippines 
as a result of these reorganizations  we recorded a charge of approximately million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we released million of the restructuring reserve 
the restructuring was completed in and we released the remaining million of the restructuring reserve 
during the years ended december  and  we did not recognize any restructuring related costs or gains 
certain charges and gains compensation obligations 
under our management incentive compensation plan  we made payments of million to senior executives and key employees in connection with the closing of our initial public offering 
we also recorded a deferred compensation liability of million related to the unpaid portion of the obligation as of december  for the years ended december  and  we made additional payments of approximately and million  respectively 
we are obligated to make additional payments of approximately million to key employees based on continued service or other performance criteria 
those payments will be made by october as of december   the remaining deferred obligation under the management incentive plan was million 
due to the amortization of the deferred compensation  million and million was expensed for the years ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following accounting policies are the policies we believe are the most critical to assist investors in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenues and deferred revenue recognition revenues are recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  and staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab sab as amended and sab summarize certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provide guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
we primarily recognize our revenues from services as those services are performed under a signed contract 
we recognize customer management fees  excluding implementation fees  as those services are performed  implementation fees ratably over the life of the contract  and commission revenues for contingent accounts receivable management contracts upon receipt of collected funds 
the company uses primarily time and contractual targets achieved to recognize revenue 
the company does not provide customer discounts or extended credit terms 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or cash received in advance of revenue recognition 
as of december  and our balance sheets reflect million and million in deferred revenues  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on credit matters we are aware of with specific customers 
the allowance is reviewed monthly to ensure that there is a sufficient reserve to cover any potential write offs 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be collected 

table of contents accounting for stock based awards effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under safs r  the pool of windfall tax benefits at adoption consists of the net credits to apic that a company would have recorded under fas r subject to potential adjustment for nol carryforwards 
effective january   we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of an equity based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had previously recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates used in calculating the fair value of options 
these include the expected term of the option  the expected volatility and the risk free interest rate 
these assumptions are included in the chart below 
the basis for our expected volatility and expected term estimates is a combination of our historical information and the historical experiences of a peer group 
the companies in the peer group were selected based upon their industry  operations  market capitalization  revenue and other factors 
the risk free interest rate is based upon yields of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option or award being valued 
peoplesupport does not currently pay a dividend nor does the company expect to pay a dividend 
the fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the following weighted average assumptions used for grants for the years ended december   and years ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years dividend yield expected volatility fair value our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r

these costs were partially offset by savings associated with the closing of other facilities totaling approximately million 
although our strategic investment in developing client service capacity may result in near term overcapacity and increased cost of revenues  we believe the investment is essential to attract and retain additional clients 
the success of this approach depends on our ability to correctly anticipate and continue building demand for our services

these amounts were partially offset by the maturing of approximately million of our marketable securities 
as in  our capital expenditures in were primarily for telecommunications equipment  leasehold improvements  computer hardware and software  and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure

excluding building out our undeveloped property  we expect capital expenditures in will be between million 
the cost to develop our recently purchased land will be spread over multiple years and is currently estimated at approximately million

or at libor plus 
we do not have any borrowings outstanding under the loan agreement as of this time 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements currently our only debt consists of the capital leases we acquired through rapidtext 
as of december   we owe less than million on the leases  which expire by may due to prepayment penalties  we do not expect to pre pay these leases and will incur nominal amounts of interest expense in and we have no other debt and no off balance sheet arrangements 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   all of which represent operating lease payment obligations 
the amounts in the table below do not include any adjustment that may result from increases in certain contractual obligations in the event inflation in the philippines exceeds contractually negotiated levels 
we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments

years ending december  in thousands thereafter total minimum payments we have the option to renew two leases under various terms  ranging from five to six years  at various rates as specified within each lease agreement 
the table above does not assume any such renewals 
our obligations under four leases may change due to inflation in the philippines or fluctuations in the value of the philippine peso relative to the value of the us dollar 
these leases provide for increases in lease payments in the case of extraordinary inflation or a significant decline in the value of the philippine peso compared to the us dollar  generally in excess of 
such occurrences are unusual

in december  peoplesupport philippines created and approved a pension plan to benefit our philippine employees

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently in the process of evaluating the financial impact of this statement 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application encouraged 
any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact of this statement on its financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
the company adopted sfas effective for the fiscal year ended december  the impact on fiscal operating results was a million charge to other comprehensive income 
this minimum pension liability adjustment increased our pension liability to approximately million 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value  nor eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas  fair value measurements  and sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the philippine peso 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our expenses were generated in the philippines 
we derive all of our revenues in us dollars 
at our current rate of expenditure  a increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the philippine peso would reduce the expenses associated with the operations of our overseas operation by approximately million  whereas a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would increase the cost associated with these operations by approximately million 
expenses relating to our operations outside the united states increased for the year ended december  when compared with the year ended december  due to increased costs associated with higher revenue generation and customer management services and the decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the philippine peso 
we fund our philippine subsidiary through us dollar denominated accounts held in the philippines 
payments for employee related costs  facilities management  other operational expenses and capital expenditures are converted into philippine pesos on an as needed basis 
effective january  we entered into forward contracts in an attempt to partially offset the increased operating costs resulting from the continued strengthening of the philippine peso 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and marketable securities totaling million at december  these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds  certificates of deposit  municipal bonds and federal agency securities 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income 
a decrease in short term rates would reduce our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
inflation rate sensitivity for the years ended december    and  approximately   and respectively  of our expenses were generated in the philippines 
the philippines has historically experienced periods of high inflation but the inflation rate has been below since for the years ended december   and average annual inflation rates of  and  respectively  kept prices generally stable 
for  the philippine central bank has set a target inflation rate of 
as of january  the most recent report from the philippine central bank expects inflation will fall within the targeted band
