during any period when contingent interest is payable  it will be payable at a rate equal to per annum 
as this contingent interest feature is based on the underlying trading price of the new notes  the contingent interest qualifies as an embedded derivative 
as of december   management determined that the fair value of this contingent interest embedded derivative was not material 
the net proceeds from this initial issuance  after deducting offering expenses  were approximately million 
financing costs of million were incurred with the original issuance and  with the exchange  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the notes  and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet

a holder that surrenders new notes for conversion in connection with certain fundamental changes that occur prior to march  may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate 
however  in lieu of increasing the conversion rate applicable to those new notes  the company may in certain circumstances elect to change its conversion obligation so that  in lieu of delivering cash  and  if applicable  shares of our common stock in respect of such conversion obligation  the company will deliver shares of the acquiring company s common stock 
in addition to the events which would constitute a change of control as defined in the indenture relating to the new notes  a fundamental change will also include the occurrence of any transaction or event or any series of transactions or events in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive stock  other securities  other property  assets or cash  unless either a the persons that beneficially owned the shares of our voting stock immediately prior to such transaction  beneficially own  shares of the surviving or continuing corporation s voting stock representing at least a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding classes of voting stock of such corporation or b both of the following conditions are satisfied i at least of the consideration other than cash payments for fractional shares or pursuant to statutory appraisal rights in such transaction consists of common stock  ordinary shares or american depository shares  and any associated rights  traded on a us national securities exchange or quoted on the nasdaq global market or that will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction and ii as a result of such transaction  the consideration due upon conversion of new notes shall be payable solely in shares of such securities  and any associated rights and cash for fractional shares

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from working capital requirements  product development activities  funding of acquisitions and debt service 
we expect to need additional funds to acquire or obtain licenses for new products  develop and test new products and potentially to acquire other businesses  which may increase our cost of capital 
we may seek funding through public and private financing and may seek to incur debt  issue shares of our stock  or both  either to finance a transaction or as consideration for a transaction 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether through the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available when we need them or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds could cause us to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product acquisitions  licensing opportunities  marketing programs  product development programs  potential business acquisitions and manufacturing opportunities 
we have historically met these cash requirements through cash from operations  borrowings and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million

these providers of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million which resulted from our increased sales  other current assets and other assets of million related primarily to increased samples for our new products  inventories of million related to increased levels for our products and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
we maintain supply agreements with third party suppliers for all of our products 
some of these supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements 
for most of these supply agreements  we believe that our inventory requirements and related purchases of inventory will exceed the minimum purchase requirement in in those cases in which we do not believe our purchases will exceed the minimum purchase requirements  we are seeking to negotiate waivers or modifications of the minimum purchase requirements 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  which was million 
the principal uses of this cash were for the purchase of marketable securities of million  of which million were reinvestment from maturing securities or additional purchases utilizing cash generated from sales  million for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily for new office furniture and computer systems for the new corporate office  million for the purchase of product licenses  specifically  million for milestone payments to bayer healthcare ag in  a million payment for the launch of ostiva in september  and million in payments related to the addition of zovirax in december net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  which was million

net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash used by financing activities of million for the year ended december  this is primarily resulting from the repurchase of our common stock for million and million for debt financing costs  consisting of the exchange of the contingent convertible debt

net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash from financing activities in was the repurchase of common stock of million 
this was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash we expect to generate from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  at least for the next twelve months 
however  in the event that we make significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  or both 
some of our supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements 
we do not expect that meeting those requirements will result in the acquisition of excessive inventory 
we expect we will also experience growth in our accounts receivable as our sales increase

critical accounting policies we view our critical accounting policies to be those policies which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments

we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to estimate the level of accounts receivable recorded on our balance sheet which will ultimately not be paid 
among other things  this assessment requires analysis of the financial strength of our customers  which can be highly subjective  particularly in the recent difficult general economic environment

we provide volume rebates  contractual price reductions with drug wholesalers and insurance companies  and certain other sales related deductions on a regular basis 
the exact level of these deductions is not always immediately known and thus we must record an estimate at the time of sale 
our estimates are based on historical experience with similar programs  and since we have a relatively small customer base  customer specific historical experience is often useful in determining the estimated level of deductions expected to be refunded to our customers when sales incentives are offered 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales deductions  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
our return policy conforms to industry standard practices 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns over the revised time period at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
liabilities assumed with the acquisition of product rights 
in connection with the acquisition of product rights  we assume certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  we estimate the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and include that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we review the estimated liability on an annual basis 
if we over or under estimate liabilities assumed  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
when we acquire the rights to manufacture and sell a product  we record the aggregate purchase price  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
we use the assistance of valuation experts to help us allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets that we have acquired 
then  we must estimate the economic useful life of each of these intangible assets in order to amortize their cost as an expense in our statement of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related asset 
the factors that drive the actual economic useful life of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include patent protection  physician loyalty and prescribing patterns  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  future introductions of competing products not yet fda approved  the impact of promotional efforts and many other issues 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our products  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we review intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances may include but are not limited to  lack of promotional sensitivity  the introduction of competitive products and changes in government regulations 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a non cash impairment charge would be recognized 
if we should incur an impairment loss  there may be a material impact to the financial statements 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in international  federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
inventory obsolescence 
our products have shelf lives ranging from to months 
we must estimate the amount of inventory recorded on our balance sheet that will not be sold prior to expiration 
this estimate requires analysis of forecasted demand for our products  our promotional focus  amounts of our products currently held by our customers and the impact on our products of competing products 
if we over or under estimate the amount of inventory that will not be sold prior to expiration  there may be a material impact to our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure is presented below 
foreign currency exchange risk our purchases of nitrolingual from pohl boskamp  our purchases of triglide from skyepharma and our purchases of sular from bayer are made in euros or are otherwise impacted by fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
although we did not enter into any forward contracts in  we may eliminate risks from foreign currency fluctuations after the time of shipment of product by entering into forward contracts for these purchases of inventory at the time of product shipments 
the company s earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
market risk on investments the fair value of our investment portfolio would be negatively affected by an increase in interest rates 
since the majority of the company s investments are fixed rate interest bearing securities and therefore subject to the market risk of loss in market value from an increase in rates or a change in the underlying risk of the issuers of the notes  the company s future earnings and cash flows could be affected adversely if the company were to sell the securities prior to their maturity date 
there was less than million in realized losses from sale of investments in the year ended december  at december   the company had total net unrealized losses from marketable securities of million 
market risk on variable rate debt in connection with borrowings incurred under the senior secured revolving credit facility arranged by ubs securities llc  we could experience market risk with respect to changes in the general level of the interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at variable rates 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
accordingly  our present exposure to interest rate fluctuations is primarily dependent on rate changes that may occur while borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are outstanding 
on december  there was no debt outstanding under this facility 
market risk on fixed rate debt the company s long term fixed interest rate senior subordinated contingent convertible notes are also subject to market risk 
fixed rate debt outstanding at december  was million with an interest rate of 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt will increase as rates decline and will decrease as rates rise 
the fixed rate notes outstanding totaling million at december  had a fair value of million based on quoted market rates
