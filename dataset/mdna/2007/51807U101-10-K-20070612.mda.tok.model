item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k report for the year ended march  forward looking statements 
for a discussion of the risk factors related to our business operations  please refer to the forward looking statements section starting at page of this report and the section entitled risk factors starting at page of this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  inventories  stock based compensation  warranties  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
product sales primarily consist of optical cards  optical card drives and specialty cards and card printers 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  orders are placed pursuant to a pre existing sales arrangement and there are no post shipment obligations other than warehousing under a us government subcontract or customer acceptance criteria 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
orders for permanent resident and border crossing cards for the us government require delivery into a secure company controlled vault 
shipments are made from the vault to a us government site 
the bill and hold procedure also provides that at the end of any one year contract term when a renewal option is not exercised  the us government is to take final delivery of any and all of its remaining inventory within six months 
at the time the cards are delivered into the vault  title to the cards is transferred to the us government and all risks of ownership are transferred as well 
the prime contractor is invoiced  with payment due within thirty days and the purchase orders do not contain any return other than for warranty or cancellation provisions 
pursuant to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  revenue is recognized on delivery into the vault as we have fulfilled our contractual obligations and the earnings process is complete 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides criteria governing how to identify whether goods or services that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer  b the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller 
in situations where the deliverables fall within higher level literature as defined by eitf  we apply the guidance in that higher level literature 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop no 
in applicable contracts 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized as services are rendered at contract labor rates plus material and other direct costs incurred 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
estimates of costs to complete include material  direct labor  overhead and allowable general and administrative expenses 
in circumstances where estimates of costs to complete a project cannot be reasonably estimated  but it is assured that a loss will not be incurred  the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin  rather than the completed contract method  is used until more precise estimates can be made 
the full amount of an estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that a loss will be realized from the performance of a contract 
for the fiscal years ended march    and  we recognized approximately   and  respectively  of revenues based on a zero profit margin related to a long term contract 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a subcontract with a prime contractor for a middle eastern country to provide them with card personalization workstation integration for use in that country s personalized national id program which includes optical memory cards  hardware  and software 
the contract covering an anticipated million worth of products and services calls for multiple deliverables  installation  and certain client acceptance criteria  as defined in the agreement 
in applying the guidance within eitf  we determined the deliverables are not to be accounted for as separate units  but rather as a bundled arrangement as the fair value of the undelivered items cannot be readily determined 
therefore  revenue recognition on this new contract and the associated contract costs were deferred until the predominant undelivered element  the card personalization  is delivered and accepted  commencing with the installation and acceptance of the card personalization system 
we determined that once the card personalization system is accepted  contract revenue would be recognized ratably based on actual cards personalized and accepted 
we began recognizing revenue under this contract during the quarter ended march  as the card personalization system was accepted during that period 
we recognized revenue totaling million in fiscal year based upon the total number of cards accepted through march  as of march  there remained million of deferred revenue and million of deferred contract costs relating to this contract 
license revenue  which may consist of up front license fees and royalty payments  is recognized as revenue when earned 
there were no costs or license revenue recorded in fiscal years   and we entered into license and optical memory card equipment purchase and support agreements  effective april   with global investments group gig  based in auckland  new zealand  for optical memory card manufacturing in slovenia 
gig transferred the license and other agreements  with our approval  to prevent global of slovenia prevent in march the agreements provide for payments to us of about million which were fully paid as of march   for a year license  the required manufacturing equipment for a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of million optical cards annually and installation support  and a four year training and support package 
for the million we received  million was recorded as advance payments from customer and million for the licensing fee was recorded as deferred revenue 
both were classified as long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   we had million of acquired equipment  plus direct and incremental expenses  classified as equipment held for resale on our consolidated balance sheets 
beginning in the fifth year of the contract  prevent is to pay million for a three year support package  then has the option for thirteen additional years of support for payments of million annually 
in addition to the million discussed above  prevent is to pay us royalties of per card for each card produced under the license 
the territories covered by the license include most of the european union and eastern european regions 
prevent has exclusive marketing rights in certain territories  with performance goals to maintain these rights 
we retain rights to utilize up to of the new facility capacity as backup and a capacity buffer to augment our own card manufacturing facilities in mountain view  california and possibly at our german subsidiary 
the granting of this license to prevent establishes a potential second source supplier of optical memory cards for existing and prospective customers who may request multiple sources for cards 
the agreement contains various elements including a card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training  and ongoing support  and contingent payments for support  materials  and royalty payments for cards manufactured 
in accordance with eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training  and support package  have been accounted for as one unit of accounting  since we were unable to determine evidence of the fair value for the undelivered items other than ongoing support 
we are able to determine evidence of fair value for the predominant undelivered item  which is the ongoing annual support of the manufacturing equipment 
accordingly  revenues for the arrangement have been deferred and will be recognized when the equipment is installed and accepted  with the exception of the value of the ongoing annual support of the manufacturing equipment which will be recognized quarterly as earned  beginning when the equipment is accepted and training has been completed  which date is dependent on prevent establishing a suitable facility in slovenia 
pursuant to ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts the support revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the agreement 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue from the license of our software products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable  and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
software revenue was immaterial for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
product warranty 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our limited warranty requires us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the customer within a specified time period after sale 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our estimate of warranty liability include the number of units sold  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amount as necessary 
we utilize historical trends and information received from our customers to assist in determining the appropriate estimated warranty accrual levels 
the following table shows our warranty liability as of march in thousands beginning balance accruals for products sold costs incurred adjustments ending balance significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for product returns 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these product sales reserves are the most reasonably likely assumptions considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our product return activity could differ significantly from our estimates 
if actual product returns are significantly different from our estimates  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
accounting for income taxes 
the deferred income tax liability of  at march  and  at march  is a result of the operations of our german subsidiary 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in fiscal year the valuation allowance decreased by million 
this decrease included a million decrease related to us income tax benefits of stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to additional paid in capital  when and if realized  that were derecognized as a result of the adoption of fas r 
the remaining change in valuation allowance relates to other increases in our gross deferred income tax assets 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards nols as of march  of million will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized 
of this amount  million represent nol s relating to windfall stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to stockholders equity when realized 
federal tax credits in the amount of  for alternative minimum taxes have no expiration 
federal tax credits in the amount of  will expire on various dates from through  if not utilized 
california tax credits in the amount of  have no expiration date 
our methodology for determining the realizability of our deferred income tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income based upon booked orders  the estimated impact of future stock option deductions  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have had difficulty in the past  and expect to have continued difficulty in the future  in reliably forecasting our foreign business and the revenue to be received from it 
this resulted in our basing our estimates of future income for these purposes on booked orders only 
as circumstances change  we may in the future be able to estimate future revenue based upon our forecast revenues rather than only using booked orders  although we cannot say when or if this will occur 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required at the end of fiscal year and and continues to be required at the end of fiscal year  we considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets 
positive evidence included the level of sales and business experienced under the contracts for the us department of homeland security s permanent resident card and border crossing card programs and for the canadian government s permanent resident card program  prospects in italy and a middle eastern country for national identification card programs  and expected future orders 
negative evidence included our reliance on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our business  the uncertainty in timing of anticipated orders from our customers  the impact of future stock option deductions on taxable income  our experience of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused through fiscal year  the recent financial statement losses  and the prior three years cumulative tax net operating losses exclusive of payments derived from the prevent contract 
in weighing the positive and negative evidence  we considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas no 
as well as the following risks related to our business dependence on vars and on a limited number of customers  lengthy sales cycles  technological change  and competition 
as described  we concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and as a result we recorded a valuation allowance equal to the full amount of the deferred income tax asset as of march  and again at march  and at march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance based on future determinations of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred income tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in the valuation allowance would be recorded as an income tax benefit or a reduction of income tax expense 
the net operating losses available to reduce future taxable income expire on various dates from fiscal year through fiscal year to the extent that we generate taxable income in jurisdictions where the deferred income tax asset relates to net operating losses that have been offset by a full valuation allowance  the utilization of these net operating losses would result in the reversal of the related valuation allowance 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or market value with market value based on replacement cost or estimated realizable value less cost to sell 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasts of product demand 
demand for optical card drives can fluctuate significantly 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of certain read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the booked orders 
we purchase drive parts for our anticipated demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
in addition  we keep a supply of card raw materials that we deem necessary for anticipated demand 
we perform an analysis of the carrying value of card and read write drive inventory on a quarterly basis 
with respect to inventory carrying values  we follow the principles articulated in sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas no 
 arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing  paragraphs through and and other authoritative guidance eg sab as it relates to determining the appropriate cost basis of inventory and determining whether firm  noncancelable purchase commitments should be accrued as a loss if forecasted demand is not sufficient to utilize all such committed inventory purchases and the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
following sfas no 
 we allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we applied sfas no 
to inventory costs incurred effective april  the provisions of this statement were applied prospectively 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 full overhead absorption would only occur if we produced at full capacity at each operation 
this resulted in the recording of the idle capacity  the difference between actual production and full capacity  as a period cost on the income statement for the period in which it arose 
in applying sfas no 
 our analysis has shown that normal capacity is greater than actual production 
therefore  the amount of period cost for excess capacity is reduced  and the per unit amount of overhead applied to production and inventory has increased 
the sfas no 
valuation applied on a fifo basis resulted in an increase to the inventory value totaling  at the period of adoption in the first quarter of fiscal year we establish lower of cost or market reserves and inventory excess and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when management determines that an item is not readily saleable 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
the excess and obsolete inventory reserves net change was a net increase of  a net relief of  and a net relief of  for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the net change for fiscal year was due largely to work in process inventory of optical memory cards based on an old design 
in those instances where we have recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory  we ensure that such new cost basis is reflected in the statement of operations if that inventory is subsequently sold 
the net relief for fiscal years and was due to disposition of reserved inventory of the optical memory cards and read write drives 
as part of our quarterly excess obsolete inventory analysis  we also determine whether lower of cost or market adjustments ie  where selling prices less certain costs are not sufficient to recover inventory carrying values are warranted 
we did not record any lower of cost or market adjustments in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended march  and during fiscal year  we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment for read write drives in the amount of  our inventory reserves are based upon the lower of cost or market for slow moving or obsolete items 
as a result  we believe a increase or decrease of sales would not have a material impact on such reserves 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform an annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets to comply with sfas no 
at march   we determined that estimated future cash flows were insufficient to justify the carrying value of these goodwill and intangible assets based on management s decision to suspend optical memory card production in germany 
as such in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of approximately million to write off goodwill and other intangible assets acquired upon the purchase of challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh of rastede  germany  and cards more gmbh of ratingen  germany on march  during fiscal years and  the future cash flows had been determined to be sufficient based in part on planned production of a portion of our optical memory cards in our facility in germany 
we intend to continue to use the facility and equipment to produce specialty cards although plans to use the facility to produce lasercard optical memory cards in germany have been suspended 
share based compensation 
as described in detail in note  share based compensation  of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and pre vesting stock option forfeitures 
we estimated the expected life of stock options granted during fiscal year ended march  based upon vesting provision and historical exercise  cancellation  and expiration patterns 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  our net income applicable to common shareholders for the fiscal year ended march  includes million of share based compensation expense including million of employee stock purchase plan expense included in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of march   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period through december  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we provided pro forma disclosures of net income loss as if the fair value based method had been applied 
our prior year s consolidated financial statements have not been restated 
results of operations overview we are headquartered in mountain view  california where we manufacture lasercard optical memory cards and card related products  including chip ready optical smart cards 
in addition  we operate a wholly owned german subsidiary acquired on march   challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh ccd  with offices in rastede and ratingen  germany  which manufactures advanced technology cards  can provide manufacturing capacity for certain steps of optical memory card production  and markets cards  system solutions  and thermal card printers 
we completed the merger of cards more gmbh also acquired on march  into challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh in january we sell our products and services through partners such as value added resellers vars and card distribution licensees  who generally have knowledge in specific markets  for the development of markets and applications for lasercard products 
we have sales staff located in california  new york  the washington dc area  and germany  whose principal role is developing and supporting the reseller channel 
revenue consists primarily of optical memory cards  optical card read write drives including systems and enabling services  specialty cards  and card printers 
our vars licensees provide country specific or market specific services necessary for contract negotiation and also may add application software  personal computers  and other peripherals  and then resell these products as integrated solutions 
we are continuing our efforts to recruit new vars and eliminate nonproductive vars 
major near term growth potential for lasercard optical memory cards is in government sponsored identification programs in several countries 
since governmental card programs typically rely on policy making  which in turn is subject to technical requirements  budget approvals  and political considerations  there is no assurance that these programs will be implemented as expected or that they will include optical cards 
our objectives for long term revenue growth include broadening the optical memory om product range to address lower end applications characterized by higher price sensitivity  diversifying om products into  and effectively penetrating  industrial and commercial markets  expanding our hardware product offering to address new markets and add value to current offerings  and increasing om product revenues with customized application software and enabling services 
the table below presents consolidated revenues  excluding inter company transactions  recorded by our us and german operations for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands us operations german operations revenues recorded by our us operations are generally derived from a small number of government customers located throughout the world 
revenues recorded by our german operations are mainly for a relatively large number of commercial customers  including universities in germany for student identification cards and organizers of sporting events for secure access cards 
historically  the largest purchaser of lasercard products has been a us government contractor  general dynamics information technology gdit  previously anteon international corporation 
gdit is the government contractor for lasercard product sales to the us department of homeland security dhs  us department of state dos  us department of defense dod  and the government of canada 
under government contracts with gdit  the dhs purchases green cards and dos laser visa border crossing cards  the dod purchases automated manifest system cards  and the canadian government purchases permanent resident cards 
encompassing all of these programs  our product sales to gdit represented  and of the total revenues for fiscal years  and respectively 
another unaffiliated company  laser memory card spa  of italy  accounted for   and of our total revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively  mainly for secure government id card programs in italy 
a third company  omar k 
alesayi communications space services co  ltd 
acss  accounted for of revenue in fiscal for a national id card program in the middle east 
our major government programs are shown below as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march  are united states green cards and laser visa bccs middle east national id program canadian permanent resident cards vehicle registration in india italian carta d identit elettronica cie cards italian permesso di soggiorno elettronico pse cards and carta di soggiorno elettronico cse cards regarding our italian programs  the most recent purchase order for cies and pses was received in august the cie program has been largely stalled since january following a change of government and the instigation of a review designed to reduce cost and improve efficiency of the program 
in march  we believe the last major hurdle to the reactivation of the cie program was removed when a government decree was published establishing the fee each citizen will pay when issued a card 
this clears the way to resume cie issuance from their substantial card inventory and to implement the national id card issuance infrastructure 
if and as this occurs  and the national id card system functions as designed  cie and pse card orders could ramp toward their full implementation level which could potentially result in annual revenues of to million 
the issuance system for pse cards is in place and operating and the government is in possession of a substantial card inventory 
there was no backlog for these programs at march  we believe that for fiscal year ending march   follow on orders for both programs will be received and significant card revenue will be realized although it remains unclear if and when the prime contractor will issue follow on orders 
us laser visa border crossing cards bccs and green cards for the us department of homeland security dhs are an important part of our revenue base 
for these programs  we recorded card revenues of million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year we received a five year follow on us government subcontract in march with an initial one year term and four one year extension options 
backlog at march  for these programs  which is deliverable through september  totaled million 
we expect to receive follow on purchase orders throughout the life of the subcontract although no assurance can be given 
under a subcontract for canada s permanent resident cards  we recorded revenue of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the backlog at march  was million and will most likely be delivered in the first half of fiscal year the delivery rate is subject to increase or decrease at customer request depending on varying permanent resident approval rates 
in january  we entered into a subcontract providing the framework for the supply of secure national id cards to a middle eastern government and the supply  installation and support of associated card personalization equipment  consumables and software 
this followed earlier deliveries of cards and card encoders under previous contracts and purchase orders 
the cards are being issued to adult citizens for national identity purposes and feature the latest advancements in identity fraud protection provided by optical idlock  a combination of the highly secure lasercard optical memory technology and embedded hologramhd  the new high definition photographic quality etched image security feature 
the subcontract covered an anticipated million worth of product and services and was the first time that we provided enabling services by assuming responsibility for both supplying and installing personalization hardware  the oversight of the card personalization process  and the quality of the fully personalized cards  including the printing of cardholder information and encoding of data and the embedded hologramhd 
in accordance with eitf  revenue on the contract and associated costs were deferred until the card system was installed and accepted 
this was completed in the quarter ended march  accordingly  we commenced recognizing the contract revenue on a pro rated basis for the cards that were accepted  and such revenue totaling million was recorded in fiscal year although orders have been slower than originally expected under the subcontract  we now anticipate additional orders for delivery in our fiscal year ending march  beginning in the june quarter 
effective april   we sold a second source card manufacturing license  including equipment  training  and support  to global investments group gig  based in auckland  new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia and began receiving associated cash payments 
recently  and with our approval  gig transferred the license to prevent global of slovenia 
we will begin to recognize revenue on this arrangement over the remaining term of the agreement starting when the equipment has been accepted and the training has been completed  which date is in turn dependent on prevent establishing a suitable facility in slovenia as discussed below under license fees and other revenues 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we implemented and activated a new erp system designed to provide additional operational and financial reporting functionality in the us operations 
thorough selection  planning  testing  and implementation processes were instituted to ensure that internal controls over financial reporting was in place 
we followed statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology transformation  to address the accounting for this internal use computer software 
these pronouncements provide guidance for determining which costs should be accounted for as internal use software and require that certain costs incurred during design and installation of internal use software be capitalized  costs incurred in the preliminary project stage and system maintenance costs be expensed as incurred  and costs incurred in conjunction with business process reengineering activities which are distinguished from software development costs be expensed as incurred 
we capitalized about  of software costs as of march  related to the erp initiative and charged approximately  inclusive of labor in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year lastly  we plan to invest up to million in additional capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures at our facilities when orders and forecasts justify the investment 
these expenditures could occur throughout the next twelve to eighteen months  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
revenues product revenues 
our total revenues consisted of sales in our three segments of optical memory cards  optical card drives  drive accessories  maintenance  systems and enabling services  and specialty cards and card printers  as well as in other miscellaneous items 
product revenues were million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year there were no license revenues earned in fiscal years   and the following table presents our product revenue by segment for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands  except for percentages change change vs vs optical memory cards of total revenues optical card drives of total revenues specialty cards and card printers of total revenues other of total revenues total revenues the following table presents our optical memory card revenue by major program for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands change change vs vs us green cards laser visas italian national id card programs canadian permanent resident cards national id cards in a middle eastern country vehicle registration in india all other programs total optical memory card revenues optical memory card revenue decreased for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year due mainly to the decrease in card unit volume for the italian cie program and increased for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year due mainly to an increase in card unit volume in the italian program as well as increases in other programs 
revenue in the optical card drive segment  including systems and enabling services  grew about million in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year due mainly to activity in the national id card program for a middle eastern government 
there was no significant change in optical card drive revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year we do not anticipate that we will derive significant profits on future drive sales as prices are set near the manufacturing cost in order to promote optical memory card sales 
specialty cards and printers revenue was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year we anticipate growth of less than in this segment in fiscal year license fees and other revenues 
there were no license revenues during fiscal year  or we entered into license and optical memory card equipment purchase and support agreements  effective april   with global investments group gig  based in auckland  new zealand  for optical memory card manufacturing in slovenia 
gig transferred the license and other agreements  with our approval  to prevent global of slovenia prevent in march the agreements provide for payments to us of about million which were fully paid as of march   for a year license  the required manufacturing equipment for a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of million optical cards annually and installation support  and a four year training and support package 
for the million we received  million was recorded as advance payments from customer and million for the licensing fee was recorded as deferred revenue 
both were classified as long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   we had million of acquired equipment  plus direct and incremental expenses  classified as equipment held for resale on our consolidated balance sheets 
beginning in the fifth year of the contract  prevent is to pay million for a three year support package  and has options for thirteen additional years of support for payments of million annually 
in addition to the million discussed above  prevent is to pay us royalties of per card for each card produced under the license 
the territories covered by the license include most of the european union and eastern european regions 
prevent has exclusive marketing rights in certain territories  with performance goals to maintain these rights 
we retain rights to utilize up to of the new facility capacity as backup and a capacity buffer to augment our own card manufacturing facilities in mountain view  california and possibly at our german subsidiary 
the granting of this license to prevent establishes a potential second source supplier of optical memory cards for existing and prospective customers who may request multiple sources for cards 
the agreement contains various elements including a card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training  and ongoing support  and contingent payments for support  materials  and royalty payments for cards manufactured 
in accordance with eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training and support package  have been accounted for as one unit of accounting  since we were unable to determine evidence of the fair value for the undelivered items other than ongoing support 
we are able to determine evidence of fair value for the predominant undelivered item  which is the ongoing annual support of the manufacturing equipment 
accordingly  revenues for the arrangement have been deferred and will be recognized when the equipment is installed and accepted  with the exception of the value of the ongoing annual support of the manufacturing equipment which will be recognized quarterly as earned  beginning when the equipment is accepted and training has been completed  which date is dependent on prevent establishing a suitable facility in slovenia 
pursuant to ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts the support revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the agreement 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled million scheduled for delivery in fiscal year  compared with million at march   and million at march  we have only a few customers who generally place orders for a several month period so that variations in order placement from a single customer can materially affect backlog 
as a result  the relative size of our backlog has not been a reliable indicator of future sales revenue trends 
in addition  the backlog for specialty cards and printers totaled million euros approximately million compared with million euros approximately million at march  and million euros approximately million at march   and for a contract to develop a conventional non optical card production facility totaled million euros approximately million at march  compared with million euros approximately million at march  and million euros approximately million at march  revenue on the contract for a conventional non optical card production facility contract is being booked on a zero profit margin basis 
therefore  the total profit under this contract will be booked at completion probably during fiscal year we have no significant backlog for read write drives 
gross margin the following table represents our gross margin in absolute amount and as a percentage of revenue by segment for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands  except for percentages change change vs vs optical memory cards of optical memory card revenues optical card drives of optical card drive revenues nm nm nm specialty cards and card printers of specialty cards and card printers revenues other of other revenues nm nm nm total gross margin of product revenue optical memory cards 
optical memory card gross margin can vary significantly based upon changes in average selling price  production and sales volumes  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
unit volume greatly affects gross margin due to the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the decrease in optical memory card gross margin to of revenue for fiscal year as compared with of revenue for fiscal year is mainly due to the decrease in production and sales unit volume and the resultant loss of efficiencies and economies of scale 
the increase in optical memory card gross margin to of revenue for fiscal year as compared with of revenue for fiscal year is mainly due to the increase in production unit volume and increase in sales unit volume with minimal increase in fixed costs augmented by increases in production efficiency and yields 
optical card drives 
read write drive gross profits have been negative over the past three years  inclusive of fixed overhead costs  due to low sales volume and our policy to price drives close to manufacturing cost to promote card sales 
this segment also includes enabling services  also with lower margins than optical memory cards 
we anticipate that read write drive negative gross margins will continue in the future unless sales volume is sufficient to cover fixed costs 
during fiscal year  we incurred approximately million in costs to convert model to model q drives 
the negative gross profit decreased from year to year because there was no similar cost in fiscal year specialty cards and card printers 
the gross margin on specialty cards and card printers was in fiscal year and in both fiscal years and over the past three years  the quarterly gross margins have generally been in the low to mid range 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for the fiscal years ended march are in thousands  except for percentage selling  general and administrative expenses percent of change from prior year research and development expenses percent of change from prior year impairment of goodwill and intangible assets selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were up million during fiscal year as compared with fiscal year about million of the increase was the result of the adoption of sfas no 
r stock option expensing 
the remaining increase was due to million of consulting services for planning  and an increase in salaries related to additional personnel which was offset mainly by the decrease in management bonus of million 
fiscal year sg a expenses increased due to million for management bonus  and decreased in almost every other spending category 
in addition  the million loss on exchange rate fluctuations on debt incurred in fiscal year was not repeated in fiscal year or we believe that sg a expenses for fiscal year will be higher than fiscal year levels  mainly due to expected increases in marketing and selling expenses as well as due to a budgeted bonus in fiscal to executives and employees versus none to executives in fiscal research and development expenses r d 
r d expenses increased million during fiscal year as compared with fiscal year we are continuing our efforts to develop new optical memory card features and structures  including various composite card structures to allow the insertion of contactless chips with radio frequency rf capability  dual interface contact contactless with optical memory  ovd optically variable device products  and other market driven requirements 
we are also performing optical media development to allow new form factors for more flexibility in card layouts and integrated security features  enhanced optical memory card read write drives for both increased reliability and ease of use and integration  and new versions of read only drives readers to meet various operational requirements such as office desktop units or handheld field units with integrated displays  biometrics  and rfid capability  along with new software products in an effort to provide new products that can stimulate optical memory card sales growth 
for example  we recently have developed a new green card authenticator application based on the lasercard reader that is currently being evaluated in the market  which allows employers to immediate validate potential employees green cards during the hiring process 
additionally  after a year of in house evaluation of our opticalproximity system for building access control  we have starting installation at our first customer location  as a test and evaluation site 
in our german subsidiary  we recently completed the development of a new integrated card personalization system and have shipped several systems to customers in the past year 
we anticipate that these ongoing research and development efforts should result in enhanced card features and capabilities  new versions of read only drives  and drives with advanced security features and or lower manufacturing costs  however  there is no assurance that such product development efforts will be successful 
these features are important for our existing and future optical memory card markets 
the decrease in r d spending for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was primarily due to the completion of major spending for the first prototype lasercard portable reader  coupled with being between phases of the new card media development project and the completion of card material and other projects 
increases in r d expenses were anticipated for fiscal year for development of production model read only drives  optical memory card media development  and other card and hardware related programs and systems 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform an annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets to comply with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
at march   we determined that estimated future cash flows were insufficient to justify the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets based on management s decision to suspend optical memory card production in germany 
as such  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of approximately million to write off goodwill and other intangible assets acquired upon the purchase of challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh of rastede  germany  and cards more gmbh of ratingen  germany on march  during fiscal years and  the future cash flows had been determined to be sufficient based in part on planned production of a portion of our optical memory cards in our facility in germany

total net other income for fiscal year was  including  of interest income  partially offset by interest expense of  and  for other miscellaneous expenses net of other miscellaneous income 
total net other income for fiscal year was  of interest income 
the increase in interest income for fiscal year compared with fiscal year was primarily due to an increase on investment rates on invested funds 
the increase in interest income for fiscal year compared with fiscal year was primarily due to higher income from invested funds 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for fiscal year  and an income tax expense of  for fiscal year and  for fiscal year the tax benefit for fiscal year was due mainly to the reduction of deferred income tax liabilities in germany and a true up of the difference in the fiscal year current provision and that which resulted on the tax return for california taxes 
the income tax expense for fiscal year was primarily due to federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
the income tax expense for fiscal year was mainly due to federal alternative minimum tax 
the payments from gig prevent received during fiscal years  and are recorded as income on the federal tax return even though they are not recorded as income under us generally accepted accounting principles 
this income has been offset by net operating loss carryforwards generated in previous years 
however  alternative minimum taxes are due when tax return income is offset by net operating loss carryforwards generated in previous years 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes cash  cash equivalents and investments as of march  in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash  cash equivalents and short term investments cash  cash equivalents  and investments decreased during fiscal year primarily due to million in purchases of property and equipment partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was million  which consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was million  which consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the stock plans 
we believe that the estimated level of revenues and customer advance payments over the next twelve months will be sufficient to generate cash from operating activities over the same period 
however  quarterly fluctuations are expected 
operating cash flows could be negatively impacted to a significant degree if either of our largest us government programs were to be delayed  reduced  canceled  or not extended  if the italian cie card program does not grow as planned internally  and if these programs are not replaced by other card orders or other sources of income  or if increases in product revenues or licenses do not keep pace with increased marketing and r d and capital expenditures 
we have not established a line of credit 
we may negotiate a line of credit  although no assurance can be made that such financing would be available on favorable terms or at all  if needed 
as a result of our net loss recorded for fiscal year  our accumulated deficit increased from million to million 
stockholders equity decreased to million from million as a result of the net loss partially offset by the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
we consider all highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of commercial paper  discount notes  and us government bonds  with original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
all investments with original or remaining maturities of more than three months but not more than one year at the date of purchase are classified as short term 
investments with original or remaining maturities of more than one year at the date of purchase are classified as long term 
we determine the length of our investments after considering our cash requirements and yields available for the type of investment considered by our company 
we determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate the classification of investments as of each balance sheet date 
as of march  we had million classified as short term investments and had no long term investments  compared with million classified as short term investments at march  all auction rate securities are accounted for as available for sale and all other interest bearing securities are accounted for as held to maturity 
we made capital equipment and leasehold improvement purchases of approximately million during fiscal year compared with approximately million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year we have an annual production capacity of million roll process cards in conjunction with approximately million sheet process cards depending upon the optimum mix of features 
we plan to purchase additional production equipment in a series of steps when we deem appropriate based in part upon orders and forecasts 
we plan to use cash on hand and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures of approximately million for equipment and leasehold improvements for card production  read write drive tooling and assembly  and general support items as customer orders justify the investment 
these expenditures could occur throughout the next twelve to eighteen months 
on march   we completed our acquisition of two related german card companies  challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh of rastede  germany  and cards more gmbh of ratingen  germany  that were later merged  collectively  the acquired german entity  including their sales operations in the united states and korea 
the acquired german entity owns a plant in rastede  germany together with associated equipment that manufactures plastic cards featuring contactless ic chip technology and high resolution printing 
we intend to continue to use the facility and equipment to produce such cards although plans to use the facility to produce lasercard optical memory cards in germany have been suspended 
during fiscal year  we commenced a share repurchase program under which up to  shares of common stock could be purchased by us from time to time in nasdaq global market transactions in an aggregate amount not exceeding million 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we used cash of  for this purpose and have since terminated this program without further activity 
there were no debt financing activities for fiscal year or contractual obligations

we invest our cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
in doing so  we seek primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of our capital and  secondarily  to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  we invest only in debt securities issued by a the us treasury and us government agencies  state agencies and corporations and b debt instruments that meet the following criteria o commercial paper rated a p or debt instruments rated aaa  as rated by the major rating services o can readily be sold for cash investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
there were no material changes during fiscal year in our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates

accordingly  any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the forward contract are reported in other income  net expenses 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated inter company receivables and payables  and loans receivable 
at march   we had a foreign exchange forward contract with a maturity of less than days to purchase million euros 
the fair value of the forward contract was not material at march
