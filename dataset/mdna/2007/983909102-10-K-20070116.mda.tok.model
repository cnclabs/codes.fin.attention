item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  we began to see positive results from our efforts to focus on the growth of our managed services business 
specifically  we enjoyed growth in recurring services revenues earned from commercial managed services customers 
this area of our business grew by and now represents almost one fourth of our total managed services revenues 
most of these new services revenues are being generated from customers with nortel equipment 
additionally  we enjoyed a increase in sales of systems in fiscal primarily reflecting increased penetration of the nortel networks corporation nortel market 
finally  in fiscal we were able to restore the gross margins on services revenues generated from maintenance contracts and time and materials t m revenues to their historical levels  although overall services margins declined slightly due to lower installation revenues 
we plan to build on our successes in fiscal by creating more intensity around the sales of nortel systems  increasing our services revenues  improving our avaya systems sales  and holding onto our already strong position in the hospitality vertical market 
to maximize our efforts in regard to these top line objectives  we have hired an experienced former nortel sales executive to help drive additional nortel equipment sales and nortel related service revenues thereby freeing up our other executive director of sales to focus on our avaya business and our two primary vertical markets 
our services business continues to be our most important growth initiative as we strive to create a larger base of recurring revenues 
the recurring portion of these revenues consist of revenues from both maintenance contracts and time and materials charges derived from both wholesale and retail market initiatives 
these revenues are generated by the activities of the national service center nsc 
under the wholesale initiative  we partner with large service integrators  manufacturers  and other larger service providers to provide services to end user customers 
under the wholesale model  we do not control the end user customer relationship  but typically act as a subcontractor to our partner 
in most instances  we provide an important component of service that our partner lacks such as complex application technical capabilities  geographic reach  around the clock access to a contact center  or installation resources 
the retail initiative mirrors the historical model we have successfully employed in the hospitality market for the past years 
in this model  we contract directly with end user customers and typically provide all the contracted services except for some specific complex software applications 
the overall market for our products and services continues to evolve rapidly as internet based telephony has become the technology standard and increasingly complex applications come online 
while these new technologies allow for easier customer self administration of systems  the additional features and broad distribution of the applications introduces new service opportunities for us 
these new service opportunities require higher technical skill levels and present opportunities for higher margin transactions with customers 
we believe these new complexities are the heart of our near term and long term opportunities for growth 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends which affected our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
results of operations year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was  compared to  million in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal we experienced very weak demand for systems in our first quarter of fiscal which severely impacted our annual results 
however  our average quarterly sales of systems to commercial customers in the second through fourth quarters were higher than our first quarter sales to commercial customers 
the first quarter weakness in systems sales was due primarily to customer driven shipping and installation schedules on some of our larger orders received in the first quarter 
these orders were recorded as revenues upon shipment primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters 
sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to the prior year and are consistent with our expectations for this portion of our business 
services 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this increase consisted of an increase in revenues earned by the nsc partially offset by a decrease in installation revenues 
nsc revenues consist of revenues earned from maintenance contracts and time and materials revenues from billings to commercial and hospitality customers 
revenues earned from maintenance contracts and time and materials t m relationships with commercial customers represent the fastest growing part of our business as these revenues grew by in fiscal this increase is primarily related to the nortel product line and represents our success in developing our retail and wholesale go to market strategies to sell nortel services 
our recurring revenues earned from hospitality customers grew modestly in fiscal  also reflecting penetration into the nortel market 
we experienced a slight decline in revenues earned from contracts to maintain our proprietary call accounting systems as some customers declined to renew service contracts for this product  reflecting the impact of cell phones and internet communications on the usage of hotel provided phone transmission 
our installation revenues declined substantially in fiscal as these revenues returned to their historical dependence on systems sales 
in fiscal  we received a large installation only contract from the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta which positively skewed our installation revenues 
we did not receive a similar contract in fiscal which resulted in a decline in these revenues and a negative impact to the overall gross margins earned on our services revenues 
similar to our retail and wholesale product offering for maintenance services  we are also planning to market our skill sets and geographic reach to provide installation services to larger nortel equipment dealers and systems integrators in an attempt to bolster these revenues and absorb the large fixed cost component of this portion of our services cost structure 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other revenue consists of commissions earned on the sale of avaya maintenance contracts and sales of equipment and or services made outside of our normal provisioning processes 
the decline in other revenues is attributable to declines in sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts and in sales of equipment made outside our normal provisioning processes 
under our dealer agreement with avaya  we are incentivized to market their maintenance contracts to the avaya customer base 
we are paid a commission on these contracts based on the size and length of the contract and the underlying equipment covered under the agreement 
sales of products provisioned outside of our normal processes generally reflects sales of phone sets to hospitality customers in which we earn a small  flat  per phone profit on the transaction 
typically  the price of the phones is negotiated by the customer with the phone distributor directly and the customer pays us a fee to handle the logistics of face plate printing  programming  and delivery 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins are consistent with our expectations for systems sales 
we maintain a high focus on systems sales margins through controls around contract acceptance and margin reviews 
we also work closely with the manufacturers that we represent and our product distributors to maximize vendor support through their rebate  promotion  and competitive discount programs 
these programs were relatively unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that despite a highly competitive market  we can hold our gross margins on systems sales relatively stable  subject to various mix factors 
however  we can give no assurance regarding possible changes in the cost of goods sold rebate programs that could either improve or further erode our margins 
the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins consist of an improvement in the gross margins earned on nsc revenues thatwas more than offset by declines in the margins earned on installation revenues 
the gross margins earned on nsc revenues returned to their historical levels as the revenues earned from our nortel managed service initiatives have grown sufficiently to absorb the investments we have made in hiring and training of technical personnel in the nortel product line and to create a presence in certain geographic locations in the us gross margins earned on installation revenues declined dramatically due to the decline in revenues as discussed above 
our cost structure to provide installation services is largely fixed  representing the cost of the highly skilled  professional workforce needed to implement the sophisticated software applications now present in nearly all systems sold 
as discussed above  we are beginning to market our installation capabilities to manufacturers  systems integrators and other large equipment dealers to be able to generate installation revenues apart from our own sales of systems  thereby absorbing a portion of our fixed costs in this area of our business 
there can be no assurance given that these marketing efforts will be successful and that we can improve our margins on installation revenues in fiscal a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues  the cost investment we make in the marketing of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts  and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
while we earn a commission on the sale of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts that has no direct cost of goods sold associated with it  we do incur costs in marketing and administration of these contracts prior to submitting them to avaya for processing 
the department which markets these contracts was formed late in fiscal and therefore fiscal s results reflect only a partial year for those expenses compared to fiscal corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this decrease reflects decreases in sales expenses and decreases in general and administrative expenses 
the reduction in sales expenses consisted of reductions in personnel related costs due to reductions in sales management expenses and lower consulting expenses 
the reductions in general and administrative expenses consists of lower legal expenses  lower depreciation expense  and improved reimbursements of market development and marketing costs by manufacturers and distributors 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense increased in fiscal by approximately  reflecting higher interest rates in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our term debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  last year 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we collected  on a customer receivable that had previously been written off 
there was not a transaction of similar magnitude in fiscal tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this increase reflects reduced operating expenses as discussed above 
our current business model targets an operating margin of 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  both commercial systems revenues and service revenues  and improve the gross margins in our services business to reach this target 
year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these results included sales of systems to commercial customers of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and sales of systems to hospitality customers of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in sales of systems to commercial customers reflected the fewer number of large projects we received in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the improvement in year over year sales of systems to hospitality customers reflects improved financial conditions in that vertical market and significantly increased new construction activity in fiscal by our largest customer in that segment 
services 
revenues earned from services activities were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase consisted of increases in revenues from both nsc related revenues and from installation services 
the revenues earned by the nsc reflect higher sales of t m services and higher revenues earned from cabling services sold during the year 
the other major component of our commercial and hospitality managed services revenues was our maintenance contract base 
revenues earned from maintenance contracts represented approximately of total managed services revenues in fiscal and was relatively unchanged from fiscal despite experiencing lower sales of systems during fiscal  our installation services revenues were flat during the year due to the marta installation contract we received at the beginning of the fiscal year and to improved sales of systems to hospitality customers 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this point increase in gross margins on systems sales was achieved through careful focus and controls around contract acceptance and margin reviews and a mix of fewer large  low margin projects 
the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase reflects the reclassification in fiscal of the costs our sales engineering department from services cost of goods sold to selling expenses 
the reclassification of these costs improved the reported services gross margins by points 
this change was made to better reflect the cost of the sales process as our sales engineers are dedicated to pre sales efforts in discovery of customer needs and design of solutions 
after considering this adjustment  our services margins would have been on a comparable basis to fiscal this decrease reflected i our continued investment in hiring and training technical personnel for our nortel initiative  ii higher materials costs to support our installed base of customers under maintenance contracts  and iii a higher usage of third party service providers to support some of our services initiatives 
a final component to our gross margins was the margins earned on other revenues and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
corporate cost of goods sold declined in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this increase in operating expenses includes the increase in sales expenses of  from the reclassification of sales engineering expenses discussed above  our investment in sales resources to support the nortel product line initiative of approximately  increased corporate expenses of approximately  related to increases in insurance costs  auditing and legal expenses  and the addition and relocation of a senior executive  reduced marketing incentive payments from our major vendors of  and increased expenses related to our oracle implementation project of  interest and other income 
interest expense consisted of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by approximately  reflecting lower average debt levels in fiscal also  during fiscal  we capitalized interest costs of approximately  related to our oracle implementation project compared to approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our term debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  last year 
the primary reason for the change in other income and expense relates to a  reversal of a legal contingency in tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal and fiscal this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this decrease reflects slightly lower revenues and the increases in operating expenses discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our financial condition improved during fiscal as our working capital grew by to million and we generated million in cash flows from operations 
these cash flows included cash from earnings and non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of million 
other positive changes in our working capital accounts generated the remaining million increase in cash 
we used these cash flows to reduce debt by million and fund capital expenditures of  of these capital expenditures   was spent on our oracle implementation and approximately  was spent on capital equipment in our business  primarily on a significant upgrade to our communications network 
at october  we had capitalized million on the oracle project 
we have segregated the cost of this asset into four groups with estimated useful lives of three  five  seven and ten years 
in fiscal we began amortizing the cost of those portions of the system that were ready for use 
our operating results for fiscal years and include  and  respectively in amortization expense related to the project 
at october  the balance on our working capital revolver was million  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
we believe that this available capacity is sufficient for our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver is scheduled to mature on september   however we expect to renew it for another month period prior to its expiration 
at october   we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements except for a requirement to not exceed  in capital expenditures 
as discussed above  our capital expenditures were  in fiscal our bank has granted a waiver of this technical violation of the credit agreement and we consider our relationship with our bank to be good 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  we believe we have access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity 
however  there are currently no plans to issue such securities 
the table below presents our contractual obligations at october  as well as payment obligations over the next five fiscal years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs sfas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted the provisions of sfas as of november  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r is effective for all interim periods beginning after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas r at the beginning of our fiscal year and recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  for fiscal year in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify the term conditional asset retirement obligation  which refers to legal obligations for which companies must perform asset retirement activity for which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional upon future events that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
however  the obligation to perform the asset retirement is unconditional  despite the uncertainty that exists surrounding the timing and method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and method of settlement for a conditional asset retirement obligation aro should be considered in estimating the aro when sufficient information exists 
fin clarifies when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of an aro 
this interpretation is effective for our fiscal year 
our adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax position  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and therefore will apply beginning with our fiscal year 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this interpretation 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise significant judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our previous judgments had predicted 
therefore  the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once those actual events are known 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of equipment based on shipment of the equipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity and customer acceptance  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables that we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal   and we conduct an annual goodwill impairment review on november of each year for the previous year just ended october to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in fiscal years and  we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in this review 
in order to make this assessment each year  we prepared a long term forecast of the operating results and cash flows associated with the major reporting units of our business 
we prepared this forecast to determine the net discounted cash flows associated with each of these units 
the value of the discounted cash flows  less bank debt  was then compared to the book value of each of those units 
there is a great deal of judgment involved in making this assessment  including the growth rates of our various business lines  gross margins  operating margins  discount rates  and the capital expenditures needed to support the projected growth in revenues 
the valuation consultant engaged to assist in this evaluation  also examines additional data regarding competitors and market valuations 
this examination also requires a great amount of subjectivity and assumptions 
based on the work performed  we determined that the fair value was greater than our carrying value and therefore no impairment had occurred 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products assembled or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors  including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in addition  in the past we have been a party to threatened litigation or actual litigation in the normal course of business 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to our utilization of variable debt 
our credit facility bears interest at a floating rate at either the london interbank offered rate libor at october  plus to depending on the company s funded debt to cash flow ratio or the bank s prime rate at october  less to also depending on the company s funded debt to cash flow ratio 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  in fiscal and would not have had a material impact on our financial position or cash flows
