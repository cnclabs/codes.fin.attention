general description of our operations as of december   we operated dealerships in metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
we developed our dealership portfolio through the acquisition of large  locally branded dealership groups operating throughout the united states 
we complemented these large dealership groups with the purchase of numerous single point dealerships and small dealership groups in our existing market areas referred to as tuck in acquisitions 
our retail network is currently organized into principally four regions and includes ten locally branded dealership groups 
the following is a detailed breakdown of our markets and dealerships as of december  brand names by region date of initial acquisition markets franchises south nalley automotive group september atlanta  ga acura  audi  bmw  chrysler  hino  honda  infiniti  isuzu truck  jaguar  jeep  lexus a  navistar  peterbilt  volvo north point auto group february little rock  ar bmw  ford  hyundai a b  lincoln  mazda  mercury  nissan a  toyota  volkswagen  volvo florida courtesy autogroup september tampa  fl chrysler  hyundai  infiniti  jeep  kia  mercedes benz  nissan  toyota coggin automotive group october jacksonville  fl buick  chevrolet  gmc a  honda a  kia a  nissan a  pontiac a  toyota  orlando  fl buick  chevrolet  ford  gmc  honda a  lincoln  mercury  pontiac fort pierce  fl bmw  honda  mercedes benz west spirit automotive group april los angeles  ca honda david mcdavid auto group april dallas fort worth  tx acura  honda a  lincoln  mercury houston  tx honda  nissan austin  tx acura mid atlantic crown automotive company december greensboro  nc acura  bmw  cadillac  chevrolet  chrysler  dodge  honda  nissan  volvo chapel hill  nc honda  volvo fayetteville  nc dodge  ford charlotte  nc honda richmond  va acura  bmw a  mini charlottesville  va bmw greenville  sc chrysler  jeep  nissan gray daniels auto family april jackson  ms buick  cadillac  chevrolet a  ford  gmc  lincoln  mercury  nissan a  pontiac  toyota plaza motor company december st

b both locations were pending divestitures as of december  and were sold in the first quarter of new vehicle sales our franchises include a diverse portfolio of american  european and asian brands 
our new vehicle sales include the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new retail and the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet the terms new retail and fleet being collectively referred to as new 
in  we retailed approximately  new vehicles through our dealerships 
new vehicle retail sales were approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  fleet sales  which provide significantly less margin than retail sales  were approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle retailed pvr 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on changes in consumer preferences as a result of our strong brand mix  which is heavily weighted towards mid line import and luxury brands please see business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification below for a discussion on our diverse offering of brands and products 
our new vehicle retail sales include new vehicle sales  new vehicle retail lease transactions and other similar agreements  which are arranged by our individual dealerships 
due to their terms  new vehicle leases  which are provided by third parties  generally cause customers to return to the market more frequently than in the case of purchased vehicles 
in addition  because third party lessors frequently give our dealerships the first option to purchase vehicles returned by customers at lease end  leases provide us with an additional source of late model vehicles for our used vehicle inventory 
generally  leased vehicles remain under factory warranty for the term of the lease  allowing dealerships to provide repair service to the lessee throughout the lease term 
used vehicle sales we sell used vehicles at virtually all of our franchised dealerships 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used 
in  we retailed approximately  used vehicles through our dealerships 
retail sales of used vehicles  which generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles  made up approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  used vehicle revenue from wholesale sales was of total revenue for the year ended december  profits from the sales of used vehicles are dependent primarily on the ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and the use of the best available technology to manage our inventory 
our new vehicle operations provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high quality trade ins and off lease vehicles  which we believe are a good source of attractive used vehicle inventory 
a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is purchased at auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers offering off lease  rental and fleet vehicles and open auctions which offer vehicles sold by other dealers and repossessed vehicles 
used vehicle inventory is typically wholesaled after approximately days  except for low value trade ins  which are wholesaled almost immediately 
the reconditioning of used vehicles also creates profitable service work for our fixed operations departments 
in addition to our high quality supply of used vehicles  we manage our used car sales on a local basis and employ the best available technology to manage our inventory and used car sales 
we transfer used vehicles among our dealerships to provide a balanced mix of used vehicle inventory at each of our dealerships 
we believe that acquisitions of additional dealerships will expand the internal market for the transfer of used vehicles among our dealerships and  therefore  increase the ability of each dealership to offer a balanced mix of used vehicles 
we have taken several steps towards building customer confidence in our used vehicle inventory  including participation in manufacturer certification programs as well as the development of our own used vehicle certification program 
the manufacturer programs make certain used vehicles eligible for vehicle benefits such as special finance rates and extended manufacturer warranties 
in addition  each dealership offers customers the opportunity to purchase extended warranties  which are provided by third parties  on its used car sales 
we intend to grow our used vehicle sales by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges  providing competitive prices  executing our marketing initiatives and increasing our focus on training 
in addition  we also intend to increase our used vehicle sales though our focus on sub prime financing 
most of our customers seek to purchase rather than lease used vehicles and most of these purchases require some level of financing 
there are a number of consumers who do not have access to traditional financing and must avail themselves of the sub prime lending market 
we have seen an increase in used vehicle gross profit at certain of our stores attributable to our focus at those stores on sales to customers in need of sub prime financing 
we plan to implement a dedicated sub prime program at more of our stores in order to better service those customers who need sub prime financing 
parts  service and collision repair we refer to the parts  service and collision repair area of our business as fixed operations 
we sell parts and provide maintenance and repair service at all of our franchised dealerships  primarily for the vehicle brands sold at those dealerships 
in addition  as of december   we maintained free standing collision repair centers in close proximity to our dealerships 
our dealerships and collision repair centers collectively operate approximately  service bays 
parts  service and collision repair centers accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit as of december  historically  fixed operations revenues have been more stable than vehicle sales 
industry wide  parts and service revenues have consistently increased over the last years primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles  the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increased number of vehicles on the road 
we believe the variety and quality of extended service plans available for both new and used vehicles in recent years has seen progressive expansion and improvement 
our fixed operations benefit from the service work generated through the sale of extended service contracts to customers who purchase new and used vehicles from us as customers tend to service their vehicles at the same location where they purchase extended warranty contracts 
as of december   warranty work accounted for approximately of our parts and service revenue 
historically  the automotive repair industry has been highly fragmented 
however  we believe that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles has made it difficult for independent repair shops to have the expertise required to perform major or technical repairs  especially as such repairs relate to luxury and mid line imports which comprise a majority of our new vehicle retail sales 
additionally  most manufacturers require warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships 
as a result  unlike independent service stations or independent and superstore used car dealerships with service operations  our franchised dealerships are qualified to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly technologically complex motor vehicles 
we use variable rate compensation structures designed to reflect the difficulty and sophistication of different types of repairs to compensate employees working in parts and service 
in addition  the profit percentages for parts vary according to market conditions and type 
one of our major goals is to retain each vehicle purchaser as a long term customer of our parts and service departments 
currently  we estimate that approximately of customers return to our dealerships for other services after the vehicle warranty expires 
therefore  we believe that significant opportunity for growth exists in the maintenance service business 
each dealership has systems in place to track customer maintenance records and to notify owners of vehicles purchased at the dealership when their vehicles are due for periodic services 
in  we implemented additional customer retention iniatives and expanded our service offerings to essentially make the fixed operations business at our stores a one stop shop 
service and repair activities are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service 
from selling tires to utilizing state of the art diagnostic equipment  our fixed operations businesses offer a variety of repairs and services  many of which other independent repair shops would not handle 
in  we added approximately fixed operations employees  including approximately technicians  to our operations to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
we experienced continued growth in this line of our business in due to the additions made in we expect our fixed operations sales to continue to grow as we i continue to invest in additional service capacity  ii upgrade equipment  iii expand our product offerings  iv capitalize on our regional training programs and v add service advisors and skilled technicians to meet anticipated future demand  especially from the increased market share of the mid line import and luxury import brands 
finance and insurance we refer to the finance and insurance area of our business as f i 
we generally arrange for the financing of the sale or lease of new and used vehicles to customers through third party vendors 
we arranged customer financing with no recourse to us on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the year ended december  these transactions result in commissions being paid to us by the third party lenders  including manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries 
our finance and insurance business generated approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  to date  we have entered into preferred lender agreements with lenders 
under the terms of the preferred lender agreements  each lender has agreed to provide a marketing fee to us above the standard commission for each loan that our dealerships place with that lender 
furthermore  many of the insurance products we sell result in additional underwriting profits and investment income yields based on portfolio performance 
we receive highly favorable pricing on these products from our vendors as a result of our size and sales volume 
we earn sales based commissions on substantially all of these products while taking virtually no risk related to loan payments  insurance payments or investment performance  which are generally borne by third parties 
these commissions are subject to cancellation  in certain circumstances  if the customer were to cancel the contract 
in may  we implemented a new f i program which increased our upfront warranty commission  which we believe will increase f i pvr by to in addition  we expect to complete the rollout of a training program in that certifies all of our f i managers  sales managers and sales associates in legal and ethical compliance matters 
recent developments on february   we commenced a tender offer and consent solicitation for our million aggregate principal amount senior subordinated notes due the notes  which is contingent on obtaining financing and is scheduled to expire on march  we are currently evaluating our financing alternatives in the capital markets 
on february   kenneth b 
gilman announced his retirement from his position as our president and chief executive officer  and his retirement from our board of directors  both effective immediately following our annual meeting of shareholders on may  charles r 
oglesby will succeed mr 
gilman as our president and chief executive officer commencing may  on february   we announced that our board of directors approved a million share repurchase program with the objective of offsetting earnings per share dilution resulting from employee stock based compensation programs 
in february  we sold two dealerships in little rock  arkansas 
we sold these dealerships for million and recognized a loss on these sales of approximately million 
these franchises were classified as discontinued operations as of december  on january   our board of directors declared a per share cash dividend 
this was the third consecutive quarter that a per share dividend was paid 
on december   asbury automotive holdings llc aah  our largest shareholder  dissolved and distributed its shares of our common stock among certain funds affiliated with freeman spogli co 
the fs funds  which held a interest in aah 
this distribution occurred following the sale of all of our common stock owned by ripplewood partners  lp ripplewood  which held a interest in aah prior to the sale  through two secondary offerings in the fourth quarter of the fs funds also sold some of their holdings of our common stock in one of these secondary offerings 
following aah s dissolution  the voting provisions of the shareholders agreement  dated as of march  as amended  the shareholders agreement  among asbury  aah and certain of our other stockholders  terminated 
consequently  we are no longer controlled by ripplewood and the fs funds will directly own and have sole voting power over the shares of our common stock held by each of them 
the fs funds collectively held approximately of our outstanding shares as of december  prior to its dissolution  aah had voting control of approximately of asbury common stock pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement 
business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification we classify our franchise sales into luxury  mid line import  mid line domestic  value  and heavy trucks 
luxury and mid line imports together accounted for approximately of our new retail vehicle revenues as of december   and comprised over of our total franchises 
over the last years  luxury and mid line imports have gained market share at the expense of mid line domestic brands 
luxury and mid line import vehicles have delivered more desirable vehicle models and have demonstrated greater resilience to downturns in the economy  garnered higher customer loyalty and presented more attractive service and used car opportunities 
the mid line import brands are generally viewed as more fuel efficient  and thus perform well during times when gas prices are high 
the following table reflects the franchises and the share of new retail vehicle revenue represented by each class of franchise as of december  class franchise number of franchises as of december  of new retail vehicle revenue for the year ended december  luxury bmw acura mercedes benz lincoln volvo cadillac infiniti lexus audi porsche jaguar land rover total luxury mid line import honda nissan toyota mazda mini volkswagen total mid line import mid line domestic chevrolet gmc pontiac chrysler ford mercury buick jeep dodge total mid line domestic value hyundai a kia total value heavy trucks hino isuzu navistar peterbilt total heavy trucks total franchise accounted for less than of new retail vehicle revenue for the year ended december  a includes two pending divestitures as of december   which were sold in the first quarter of asbury s geographic coverage encompassed different metropolitan markets at locations in states as of december  arkansas  california  florida  georgia  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  texas and virginia 
new vehicle sales revenue is diversified among manufacturers and for the year ended december  of which honda  nissan  mercedes benz  toyota  bmw  lexus  acura and ford represented of the portfolio 
we believe that our broad geographic coverage as well as diversification among manufacturers decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as warranty issues or production disruption 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability for a list of such manufacturer specific risks 
each of our dealerships maintains a strong local brand that has been enhanced through local advertising over many years 
we believe our cultivation of strong local brands is beneficial because consumers prefer to interact with a locally recognized brand 
by placing franchises in one geographic location under a single  local brand  we expect to generate advertising synergies and retain customers even as they purchase and service different automobile brands 
maintain variable cost structure and emphasize expense control we continually focus on controlling expenses and expanding margins at our existing dealerships and those that are integrated into our operations upon acquisition 
our variable cost structure generally helps us manage expenses in a variety of economic environments  as the majority of our operating expenses consist of incentive based compensation  vehicle carrying costs  advertising and other variable and controllable costs 
the majority of our general manager compensation and virtually all salesperson compensation is tied to profits of the dealership 
salespersons  sales managers  service managers  parts managers  service advisors  service technicians and the majority of other non clerical dealership personnel are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission 
we believe we can further manage these types of costs through best practices  standardization of compensation plans  controlled oversight and accountability  and centralized processing systems 
focus on higher margin products and services while new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships  fixed operations  used vehicle retail sales  and finance and insurance generally provide significantly higher profit margins and account for the majority of our profitability 
in addition  we have discipline specific executives at both the corporate and regional levels who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers 
while each of our dealership general managers has the independence and flexibility to respond effectively to local market conditions  each pursues an integrated strategy  as directed from our centralized management team  to grow these higher margin businesses to enhance profitability and stimulate organic growth 
fixed operations 
we offer parts  perform vehicle service work and operate collision repair centers  all of which provide important sources of recurring revenue with high gross profit margins 
for the year ended december   gross profits from these businesses absorbed approximately of our total operating expenses  including corporate office expenses  but excluding salespersons compensation 
we intend to continue to grow this higher margin business and increase this cost absorption rate by adding new service bays and increasing capacity utilization of existing service bays 
to help ensure high levels of customer satisfaction within our parts  service and collision repair operations  we continue to add skilled technicians and service advisors to our operations 
in addition  given the increased sophistication of vehicles  our repair operations provide detailed expertise and state of the art diagnostic equipment that we believe independent repair shops cannot adequately provide 
our repair operations also provide manufacturer warranty work that must be done at certified franchise dealerships  rather than through independent dealers 
used vehicles 
we sell used vehicles at virtually all of our franchised dealerships 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction 
we intend to grow our used vehicle business by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges  providing competitive prices  continuing to enhance our marketing initiatives and focusing our efforts on servicing our customers who need sub prime financing 
finance and insurance 
in the past two years we have increased our finance and insurance revenues by offering a broad range of conventional finance and lease alternatives to fund the purchase of new and used vehicles 
moreover  continued in depth sales training and certification efforts and innovative computer technologies has and will serve as important tools in growing our finance and insurance profitability 
we have increased dealership generated finance and insurance revenue per vehicle retailed to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  we have successfully increased our dealership generated finance and insurance revenue per vehicle retailed each year since our inception 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reconciliation of non gaap financial information 
local management of dealership operations and centralized administrative and strategic functions we believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales  customer service and inventory requirements 
our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers in which the general managers are responsible for the operations  personnel and financial performance of their dealerships as well as other day to day operations 
our local management teams familiarity with their markets enables them to effectively run day to day operations  market to customers  recruit new employees and gauge acquisition opportunities in these markets 
the general manager of each dealership is supported by a management team consisting  in most cases  of a new vehicle sales manager  a used vehicle sales manager  a finance and insurance manager  and a fixed operations manager 
we have a management structure that is intended to promote and reward entrepreneurial spirit and the achievement of team goals 
this management structure is complemented by regionally centralized technology and financial controls  as well as sharing market intelligence throughout the organization 
see experienced and incentivized corporate and dealership management below for a discussion of the incentive based pay system for management at our corporate office and at our dealerships 
we employ professional management practices in all aspects of our operations  including information technology and employee training 
our dealership operations are complemented by regionally centralized technology and strategic and financial controls  as well as shared market intelligence throughout the organization 
corporate and dealership management utilize computer based management information systems to monitor each dealership s sales  profitability and inventory on a regular basis 
we believe the application of professional management practices provides us with a competitive advantage over many independent dealerships 
we regularly examine our operations in order to identify areas for improvement and disseminate best practices company wide 
our corporate headquarters are located in new york  new york 
the corporate office is responsible for the capital structure of the business and its expansion and operating strategy 
the implementation of our operational strategy rests with each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures established by the corporate office 
investment in human capital we recognize that our ability to control the growth of our new vehicle sales is limited by external factors  including the manufacturers ability to develop new vehicle models  manufacturer rebates and incentives  consumer confidence  oil and gas prices  interest rates and the availability of credit for consumers 
growth in our fixed operations business is dependent on our ability to generate long term customer relationships and having our customers return to our stores for service and repairs 
our finance and insurance business is dependent on our ability to arrange financing for our customers through third party vendors 
in each line of our business  our ability to capture the customer and close the deal will enable us to generate revenue 
in our effort to seek continued growth in all of our business lines and set us apart from our competitors  we invest in the education and growth of our employees 
over the past two years  we have implemented programs to certify our finance and insurance managers  our new and used sales managers and our sales force in the areas of compliance and ethics 
these employees either attend classes or seminars on compliance and ethics as such topics relate to the automotive retailing industry  and more specifically  finance and insurance for the finance and insurance managers  and are then required to pass a written examination on these subjects in order to receive certification 
the employees are required to maintain their certification annually which keeps their knowledge of compliance and ethics current 
furthermore  we believe that by certifying these employees  we build the knowledge base of our employees  which  in turn  improves morale and performance 
we expect that by may  our entire sales force will be certified 
in addition  in three of our four regions  we have a regional training program for our fixed operations employees that addresses various aspects of our fixed operations business  including tire sales and oil sales 
our fixed operation employees are trained so that they can in turn hold new car clinics and service clinics for our customers 
we believe that by increasing the knowledge base of our fixed operations employees  we not only build their confidence and increase their performance  such training provides better experience for our customers as they interact with those employees 
we believe that a customer who has a positive experience with one of our employees will be a repeat customer  which  in return  will lead to the continued growth of our business 
experienced and incentivized corporate and dealership management we have a corporate management team that has served in prominent leadership positions  including positions at other fortune companies

gordon smith has served as our senior vice president and chief financial officer since september he joined us following over years with general electric company ge 
during his last twelve years at ge he served as chief financial officer for three of ge s commercial finance businesses corporate financial services  commercial equipment finance and capital markets 
we believe that our leadership at the store level represents some of the best talent in the industry 
our regional executives and store general managers are proven leaders in their local markets and have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry 
in addition  our continued focus on college recruiting  training  development  and retention is designed to maintain our talented management pool 
see business strategy investment in human capital for further description of certain of our training programs 
we tie compensation of our senior dealership management to performance by relying upon an incentive based pay system 
we compensate our general managers based on dealership profitability  and our department managers and salespeople are similarly compensated based upon departmental profitability and individual performance 
continued growth through targeted acquisitions acquisitions continue to be part of our growth strategy 
in the past  we have focused our acquisition strategy on establishing a presence in new markets through the purchase of multiple individual franchises or through the acquisition of large  profitable and well managed dealership groups with leading market positions 
our present strategy is to become the leader in every market in which we currently operate  although we will examine opportunities to acquire large dealership groups or enter new markets as they become available 
as such  we intend to evaluate tuck in acquisitions  or acquisitions in existing regions  that complement our current dealerships 
tuck in acquisitions are typically re branded immediately after acquisition and operate thereafter under our respective local brand name 
by focusing on geographic and brand diversity  we seek to manage economic risk and drive growth and profitability 
because we own dealerships of all major brands and avoid concentration with one manufacturer  we are well positioned to respond to changing customer preferences and should not be adversely affected by specific product supply shortages 
we believe that these tuck in acquisitions have facilitated  and will continue to facilitate  our regional operating efficiencies and cost savings 
in addition  we have generally been able to improve the gross profit of tuck in acquisitions within twelve months following the acquisition 
we believe this is due to a number of factors depending on the acquisition  including improvements in the number of finance and insurance products sold per vehicle retailed  greater utilization of service bays acquired in the acquisition  improved management practices  and enhanced unit sales volumes related to the strength of our local brand names 
commitment to customer service we are focused on providing a high level of customer service to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer 
we attempt to design our dealership service business to meet the needs of our customers and establish relationships that will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals 
furthermore  we provide our dealership managers with incentives to employ more efficient selling approaches  engage in extensive follow up to develop long term relationships with customers and extensively train our sales staff to be able to meet customer needs 
we continually evaluate innovative ways to improve the buying experience for our customers and believe that our ability to share best practices across our dealerships gives us an advantage over independent dealerships 
in addition  our dealerships regard service and repair operations as an integral part of the overall approach to customer service  providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships and improve customer loyalty 
we continue to add skilled technicians and service advisors to our operations to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
we intend to invest in the human capital necessary to ensure that this aspect of our business continues to expand 
marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our business with a broad base of repeat  referral and new customers 
our primary advertising medium is local newspapers  followed by radio  television  direct mail  the internet and the yellow pages 
in addition  in we implemented new strategies that use electronic mail to assist our marketing efforts and that allow us to stay in contact with our customers 
the automotive retail industry has traditionally used locally produced  largely non professional materials for advertising  often developed under the direction of each dealership s general manager 
we have created common marketing materials for our brand names using professional advertising agencies 
our corporate sales and marketing department helps oversee and share creative materials and general marketing best practices across our dealerships 
our total company marketing expense was million for the year ended december   which translates into an average of per retail vehicle sold 
in addition  manufacturers direct advertising spending in support of their brands has been historically a significant component of the total amount spent on new car advertising in the united states 
management information systems we consolidate financial  accounting and operational data received from our dealers nationwide through a private communication network 
the data from the dealers is gathered and processed through their individual dealer management system 
our dealerships use software from adp  inc or reynolds reynolds  co 
as their dealer management system 
we aggregate the information from the dealer systems at our corporate headquarters to create one single view of the business using hyperion financial products 
our information technology approach enables us to quickly integrate and aggregate the information from a new acquisition 
by creating a connection over our private network between the dealer management system and corporate hyperion financial products  corporate management can quickly view the financial  accounting and operational data of the newly acquired dealer 
therefore  we are able to efficiently integrate the acquired dealer into our operations 
hyperion s products allow us to easily and quickly review operating and financial data at a variety of levels 
for example  from our headquarters  management can review the performance of any specific department eg  parts and services at any particular dealership 
this system also allows us to quickly compile and monitor our consolidated financial results 
competition in new vehicle sales  our dealerships compete primarily with other franchised dealerships in their regions 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from the manufacturers 
instead  we rely on advertising and merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local brand names and location of our dealerships to sell new vehicles 
our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealers  independent used car dealers  automobile rental agencies and private parties for supply and resale of used vehicles 
see risk factors risks related to competition substantial competition in automobile sales may adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automobile dealers and franchised and independent service centers for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automobile dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are the use of factory approved replacement parts  price  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models  and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains as well as some competing franchised dealers may offer certain parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices 
in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  financial institutions are now offering finance and insurance products through the internet  which may reduce our profits on these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and flexibility in contract length 
we compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and competition may increase acquisition pricing of target dealerships 
dealer and framework agreements each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer or in some cases the distributor of each brand of new vehicles sold at the dealership 
in addition  in connection with our heavy trucks business in atlanta  georgia  we have entered into dealer agreements pursuant to which we provide factory authorized service and warranty repairs on heavy trucks that we are not authorized to sell 
our typical dealer agreement specifies the locations at which the dealer has the right and obligation to sell the manufacturer s vehicles and related parts and products and or to perform certain approved services 
each dealer agreement also governs the use of the manufacturer s trademarks and service marks 
the allocation of new vehicles among dealerships is subject to the discretion of the manufacturer  and generally does not guarantee the dealership exclusivity within a given territory 
most dealer agreements impose requirements on virtually every aspect of the dealer s operations 
for example  most of our dealer agreements contain provisions and standards related to inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts  the maintenance of minimum net working capital and in some cases minimum net worth  the achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets  advertising and marketing practices  facilities  signs  products offered to customers  dealership management  personnel training  information systems and dealership monthly and annual financial reporting 
in addition to requirements under dealer agreements  we are subject to additional provisions contained in supplemental agreements  framework agreements  dealer addenda and manufacturers policies  collectively referred to as framework agreements 
framework agreements impose additional requirements similar to those discussed above 
such agreements also define other standards and limitations including company wide performance criteria  capitalization requirements  limitations on changes in our ownership or management  limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us  restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries or have these subsidiaries guarantee payment of certain obligations  and conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions  including limitations on the total local  regional and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition 
some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to purchase its dealerships from us under certain additional circumstances  including our failure to meet the manufacturer s capitalization or working capital requirements or operating guidelines  our failure to meet certain financial requirements  the occurrence of an extraordinary corporate transaction at our parent entity level or dealership operating entity level without the manufacturer s prior consent  a material breach of the framework agreement or acceleration of obligations under our credit facility the committed credit facility  our senior subordinated notes due the notes or our notes 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer s brands to a third party 
these agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under state dealer laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration 
provisions for termination or non renewal of dealer and framework agreements 
certain of our dealer agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one year to six years  while other of our agreements have a perpetual term 
we expect to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business 
however  typical dealer agreements give the manufacturer the right to terminate or the option of non renewal of the dealer agreements under certain circumstances  including insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership  failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels  impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  change of control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer  or material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected  for a further discussion of the risks related to the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements 
while our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed for the reasons listed above  it is possible to negotiate a waiver of termination or non renewal with the manufacturer 
manufacturers limitations on acquisitions 
our dealer agreements and framework agreements typically require us to maintain certain performance standards and obtain the consent of the applicable manufacturer before we can acquire any additional dealership franchises 
a majority of these agreements impose limits on the number of dealerships we are permitted to own at the metropolitan  regional and national levels 
these limits vary according to the agreements we have with each of the manufacturers but are generally based on fixed numerical limits or on a fixed percentage of the aggregate sales of the manufacturer 
under our current framework and dealer agreements  we are close to our franchise ceiling with toyota and lexus and at such ceiling with jaguar 
we are currently not able to acquire additional ford  lincoln or mercury dealerships  however  we may negotiate with ford for a waiver 
from time to time certain other manufacturers also assert sales and customer satisfaction and other deficiencies at certain of our dealerships causing us to be ineligible to acquire certain additional dealerships until such deficiencies have been remedied or relief from such requirements can be negotiated 
it is our practice to cooperate with these manufacturers to correct the alleged performance and other issues  including at times entering into supplemental action plan agreements detailing the steps we will take and in some cases specifying the timeframes in which we plan to achieve improved performance at these dealerships 
unless we negotiate favorable terms with  or receive the consent of  the manufacturers  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions upon reaching the limits or if we fail to maintain performance standards provided for in the framework agreements 
see also risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth 
state dealer laws 
we operate in states that have state dealer laws limiting manufacturers ability to terminate dealer agreements 
however  some framework agreements attempt to limit the protection of state dealer laws 
we are basing the following discussion of state dealer laws on our understanding of these laws 
furthermore  we cannot predict to what degree we will be entitled to state dealer law protections as a result of provisions in our framework agreements that purport to limit our state law rights 
state dealer laws generally provide that it is a violation for manufacturers to terminate or refuse to renew dealer agreements unless they provide written notice to the dealers setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or nonrenewal 
state dealer laws typically require reasonable advance notice to dealers prior to termination or nonrenewal of a dealer agreement 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions within the notice period and allow dealers an opportunity to cure non compliance with the manufacturers criteria 
these statutes also provide that manufacturers are prohibited from unreasonably withholding approval for a proposed change in ownership of the dealership 
in several states  acceptable grounds for disapproval are limited to material reasons relating to the character  financial ability or business experience of the proposed transferee and may also include current performance of the proposed transferee in operating other dealerships of the same manufacturer 
see risk factors risks related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if state dealer laws are repealed or weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
governmental regulations we are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations governing our marketing  advertising  selling  leasing  financing and servicing of motor vehicles and related products 
our dealerships also are subject to state laws and regulations generally relating to corporate entities 
under various state laws  each of our dealerships must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or provide certain automotive repair services 
these laws also regulate conduct of our businesses  including advertising and sales practices 
other states into which we may expand our operations in the future are likely to have similar requirements 
the sales of financing products to our customers are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding truth in lending  deceptive and unfair trade practices  leasing  equal credit opportunity  motor vehicle finance  installment sales  insurance and usury 
some states regulate finance fees  administrative fees and other charges that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales 
penalties for violation of any of these laws or regulations may include revocation of necessary licenses  injunctive relief  assessment of criminal and civil fines and penalties 
in certain instances  these laws create a private cause of action for individuals 
we believe that we comply substantially with all laws and regulations affecting our business and do not have any material liabilities under such laws and regulations 
we believe that compliance with all such laws and regulations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  earnings or competitive position 
see risk factors other risks related to our business governmental regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and the remediation of contamination 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes 
operations involving the management of wastes are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
pursuant to these laws  federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply 
our business also involves the use of above ground and underground storage tanks 
under applicable laws and regulations  we are responsible for the proper use  maintenance and abandonment of our regulated storage tanks and for remediation of subsurface soils and groundwater impacted by releases from existing or abandoned storage tanks 
in addition to these regulated tanks  we own  operate  or have otherwise closed in place other underground and above ground devices or containers such as automotive lifts and service pits that may not be classified as regulated tanks  but which could or may have released stored materials into the environment  thereby potentially obligating us to clean up any soils or groundwater resulting from such releases 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at or from our facilities or at facilities where we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state statutes  imposes liability for the entire cost of a cleanup  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at such sites 
these responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances 
currently  we are not aware of any material superfund or other remedial liabilities to which we are subject 
further  the federal clean water act and comparable state statutes prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without the necessary permits  require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans 
we believe that we are in material compliance with those wastewater discharge requirements as well as requirements for the containment of potential discharges and spill contingency planning and other environmental laws applicable to our operations 
environmental laws and regulations are very complex and it has become difficult for businesses that routinely handle hazardous and non hazardous wastes to achieve and maintain full compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
from time to time we experience incidents and encounter conditions that will not be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
however  none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past  nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future 
nevertheless  environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement are changed frequently and we believe that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue 
hence  there can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations or the future discovery of unknown environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures would not be material 
see risk factors other risks related to our business governmental regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons 
we believe our relationship with our employees is favorable 
we do not have employees that are represented by a labor union 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses that have unionized employees 
certain of our facilities are located in areas of high union concentration  and such facilities are susceptible to union organizing activity 
in addition  because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers  we may be affected adversely by labor strikes  work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturers production facilities and transportation modes 
insurance because of their vehicle inventory and the nature of the automotive retail business  automobile retail dealerships generally require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
our insurance program includes multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of million 
we also have directors and officers insurance  real property insurance  comprehensive coverage for our vehicle inventory  garage liability and employee dishonesty insurance 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating our business 
risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected 
each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer or manufacturer authorized distributor of each new vehicle brand it carries 
our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers  sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers trademarks only to the extent permitted under dealer agreements 
as a result of the terms of our dealer agreements and our dependence on these franchise rights  manufacturers exercise a great deal of control over our day to day operations and the terms of our dealer agreements govern key aspects of our operations  acquisition strategy and capital spending 
most of our dealer agreements provide the manufacturer with the right to terminate the agreement or refuse to renew it after the expiration of the term of the agreement under specified circumstances 
we cannot assure you we will be able to renew any of our existing dealer agreements or that we will be able to obtain renewals on favorable terms 
specifically  many of our dealer agreements provide that the manufacturer may terminate the agreement or direct us to divest the subject dealership if there is a change of control of the dealership 
some of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with the right of first refusal to purchase from us any franchise we seek to sell 
provisions such as these may provide manufacturers with superior bargaining positions in the event that they seek to terminate our dealer agreements or renegotiate the agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our franchise rights become compromised or our operations restricted due to the terms of our dealer agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant source of our revenues 
in addition  we have agreements with toyota which provide that in the event that our payment obligations under our committed credit facility or our notes are accelerated or demand for payment is made under our subsidiaries guarantees of the committed credit facility or our notes as a result of an event of default  toyota will have the right to purchase our toyota and lexus dealerships for cash at their fair market value  unless the acceleration or demand is waived within a cure period of no less than days after toyota s notification of its intent to exercise its right to purchase 
if fair market value cannot be agreed by the parties  it will be determined by an independent nationally recognized and experienced appraiser 
we also have an agreement with ford that provides if any of the lenders of our committed credit facility or floor plan facilities accelerate those payment obligations  or if we are notified of any default under our committed credit facility  then ford may exercise its right to acquire our ford  lincoln and mercury dealerships for their fair market value 
our failure to meet manufacturer consumer satisfaction  financial or sales performance requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known in the automotive retailing industry as consumer satisfaction indexes csi 
csi ratings augment the ability of manufacturers to monitor the financial and sales performance of dealerships 
at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealership or framework agreement  several manufacturers establish certain sales or performance criteria for that dealership  in some cases in the form of a business plan 
the criteria of these performance indicators have been modified by various manufacturers from time to time in the past  and we cannot assure you that these criteria will not be further modified or replaced by different systems in the future 
some of our dealerships have had difficulty from time to time meeting these standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these standards in the future 
in addition  manufacturers may use these performance indicators  as well as sales performance numbers  as factors in evaluating applications for acquisitions 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance standards 
this may impede our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and hinder our ability to grow 
see also  risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
in addition  we receive payments from certain manufacturers based  in part  on csi scores  and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi scores decline 
the reorganization by  or the bankruptcy of  one or more of the manufacturers could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
certain manufacturers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent periods 
sustained periods of poor financial performance by a manufacturer may force it to seek to reorganize or to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy 
a reorganization by a manufacturer may  among other things  result in a delay in the introduction of new or competitive makes or models  an elimination of certain makes or models or dealership locations  or a disruption in vehicle deliveries to our dealerships 
if an attempted reorganization proves unsuccessful for the manufacturer  the continued financial distress could result in the cessation of its operations 
in the event of a bankruptcy by a vehicle manufacturer  among other things i the manufacturer could seek to terminate all or certain of our franchises  and we may not receive adequate compensation for them  ii we may not be able to collect some or all of our receivables that are due from such manufacturer and we may be subject to preference claims relating to payments to us made by such manufacturer prior to bankruptcy  iii it may increase our cost to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory with such manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary  which may cause us to finance our new vehicle inventory with alternate finance sources on less favorable terms  and iv consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be materially adversely affected  especially if certain of costs related to improving such manufacturer s poor financial condition are imputed to the price of its products 
the occurrence of any one or more of the above mentioned events could have a material adverse affect on our day to day operations 
furthermore  such events could result in a partial write down of our manufacturer franchise rights to the extent that we have recorded them or our receivables  and a partial write down of our goodwill 
see also risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire any additional dealerships 
in addition  many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain customer service and sales performance standards as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will meet these performance standards and that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions  which may deter us from being able to take advantage of market opportunities and restrict our ability to expand our business 
the process of applying for and obtaining manufacturer consents can take a significant amount of time  generally to days or more 
delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe will produce acquisition synergies and integrate well to our overall growth strategy 
in addition  manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their dealerships on a case by case basis 
as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition  a manufacturer may require us to remodel and upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose  causing us to divert our financial resources from uses that management believes may be of higher long term value to us 
furthermore  the exercise by manufacturers of their right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we have identified as important to our growth  thereby having an adverse affect on our ability to grow through acquisitions 
likewise  from time to time  we may determine that it is in our best interest to divest of an unprofitable dealership 
parties that are interested in acquiring our dealership must also seek the consent of the manufacturers 
the refusal by the manufacturer to approve a potential buyer would delay the divestiture of the dealership as we would either have to find another potential buyer  which could take some time  or wait until the buyer is able to meet the expectations of the manufacturer 
a delay in the sale of an unprofitable dealership may have a negative impact on our profitability and an adverse affect on our business 
many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may obtain 
certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national  regional or local basis 
manufacturers may also tailor these types of restrictions to particular dealership groups 
we are close to our franchise ceilings with toyota and lexus and at such ceiling with jaguar 
we are currently not able to acquire additional ford  lincoln or mercury dealerships  however  we may negotiate with ford for a waiver 
if we reach these franchise ceilings discussed above  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions  which could affect our growth 
if state dealer laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
state dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
we have framework agreements with certain of our manufacturers 
among other provisions  these agreements attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their dealer agreements upon expiration 
in addition  in some states these laws restrict the ability of automobile manufacturers to compete directly in the retail market 
if manufacturers obtain the ability to directly retail vehicles and do so in our markets  such competition could have a material adverse effect on us 
see business dealer and framework agreements state dealer laws 
manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or  in some cases  its parent  without manufacturer consent 
our agreements with some manufacturers provide that  under certain circumstances  we may lose either through termination or forced sale the franchise if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote a specified level of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
this trigger level can fall to as low as if another vehicle manufacturer or a person with a criminal record is affiliated with the entity acquiring the ownership interest or voting rights 
violations by our stockholders of these ownership restrictions are generally outside of our control and may result in the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
our dealerships depend upon vehicle sales and  therefore  their success depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry 
the success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue through new vehicle sales 
new vehicle sales also tend to lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and service operations 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand  we have focused our new vehicle sales operations on mid line import and luxury brands 
for the year ended december   brands representing or more of our revenues from new vehicle retail sales were as follows brand of total new vehicle retail sales honda nissan mercedes benz toyota bmw lexus acura ford no other brand accounted for more than of our total new vehicle retail sales revenue for the year ended december   except for navistar  which was a result of significant demand for new heavy trucks during due to changes in emission laws effective in january if we fail to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles 
typically  popular vehicles produce the highest profit margins but tend to be the most difficult to obtain from manufacturers 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership 
if our dealerships experience prolonged sales slumps  those manufacturers will cut back their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and new vehicle sales and profits may decline 
if automobile manufacturers discontinue incentive programs  our sales volumes may be adversely affected 
our dealerships depend on manufacturers for certain sales incentives  warranties and other programs that are intended to promote and support new vehicle sales 
manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
some key incentive programs include customer rebates on new vehicles  dealer incentives on new vehicles  extensions of employee discounts  special financing or leasing terms  and warranties on new and used vehicles 
a reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers incentive programs may reduce our new vehicle unit sales and related revenue 
adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability 
the success of each of our dealerships depends to a great extent on vehicle manufacturers financial condition  marketing efforts  vehicle design  production capabilities  reputation  management  and labor relations 
adverse conditions affecting these and other important aspects of manufacturers operations and public relations may adversely affect our ability to market their automobiles to the public and  as a result  significantly and detrimentally affect our profitability 
risks related to our acquisition strategy if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships  we will be unable to realize desired results from our growth through acquisition strategy and acquired operations will drain resources from comparatively profitable operations 
we believe that the automobile retailing industry is a mature industry in which we expect relatively slow growth in industry unit sales 
accordingly  we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to manage expansion  control costs in our operations and acquire and integrate acquired dealerships into our organization 
in pursuing our strategy of acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to failing to obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises  incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships  incurring undisclosed liabilities at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources  and impairing relationships with employees  manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management 
we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel  procedures and structures  including our financial and reporting control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
moreover  our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risk associated with integrating the acquired dealership 
if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands  we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable 
see also risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth 
the competition with other dealer groups to acquire automotive dealerships is intense  and we may not be able to fully implement our growth through acquisition strategy if attractive targets are acquired by competing groups or if competition drives prices to the point where an acceptable rate of return is not achievable 
we believe that the united states automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates that meet our targeting criteria 
however  we compete with several other national  regional and local dealer groups  some of which may have greater financial and other resources 
competition for attractive acquisition targets with existing dealer groups and dealer groups formed in the future may result in fewer acquisition opportunities and increased acquisition costs 
we will have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
risks related to competition substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retailing and servicing industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles that we offer  other national or regional affiliated groups of franchised dealerships  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  internet based vehicle brokers that sell vehicles obtained from franchised dealers directly to consumers  sales of used vehicles by rental car companies  service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we typically rely on advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles 
our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues or profitability may be materially and adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or are awarded additional franchises by manufacturers that supply our dealerships 
risks related to the automotive retail industry our business will be harmed if overall consumer demand suffers from a severe or sustained downturn 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
our revenues will be materially and adversely affected if there is a severe or sustained downturn in overall levels of consumer spending 
retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as the level of discretionary personal income  credit availability and interest rates 
future recessions may have a material adverse effect on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles 
in addition  severe or sustained increases in gasoline prices may lead to a reduction in automobile purchases or a shift in buying patterns from luxury suv models which typically provide higher profit margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower margins 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in our various geographic areas 
our dealerships currently are located in the atlanta  austin  chapel hill  charlotte  charlottesville  dallas fort worth  fayetteville  fort pierce  fresno  greensboro  greenville  houston  jackson  jacksonville  little rock  los angeles  orlando  richmond  sacramento  st 
louis and tampa markets and the results of our operations therefore depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending levels in those areas 
the seasonality of the automobile retail business magnifies the importance of our second and third quarter results 
the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for automobiles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters than in our second and third quarters 
if conditions surface during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year will be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably 
a portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  import duties  exchange controls  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
a decline of available financing in the sub prime lending market may adversely affect our sales of used vehicles 
the majority of vehicle buyers  particularly those seeking to purchase used vehicles  finance the purchase of such vehicles 
sub prime lenders have historically provided financing to those buyers who  for a number of reasons  do not have access to traditional financing  including those buyers who have a poor credit history or lack the down payment necessary to purchase a vehicle 
it appears that sub prime lenders are becoming more stringent with their credit standards and may continue to apply higher standards in the future 
if there is a decline in the availability of credit in the sub prime lending market  the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited  resulting in a decline in our used vehicle sales 
retail sales of used vehicles generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles 
a decline in our used vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
other risks related to our business failure to comply with certain covenants in our debt and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and adversely impact our compliance with our committed credit facility 
we have certain debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total debt of million  excluding floor plan notes payable and the effects of our fair value hedge on our notes 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our committed credit facility and the indentures governing our notes and our notes 
we will have substantial debt service obligations  consisting of required cash payments of principal and interest  for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we have operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt instruments  including our committed credit facility and the indentures under our notes and our notes 
in particular  our committed credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of the covenants in our debt instruments or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  as a result of entering into a number of sale leaseback agreements  a number of our dealerships are located on properties that we lease rather than own 
each of the leases governing such properties has certain covenants with which we must comply 
in the event of any default under our committed credit facility  the payment of all outstanding borrowings could be accelerated  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees  and we would be required to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings or could be prevented from making debt service payments on our notes and our notes  any of which would be an event of default under the respective indentures for such notes 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment 
we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory and have the ability to finance the purchase of used vehicle inventory using floor plan credit facilities under which we are charged interest at floating rates 
in addition  we obtain capital for general corporate purposes  dealership acquisitions and real estate purchases and improvements under predominantly floating interest rate credit facilities 
therefore  our interest expense from variable rate debt will rise with increases in interest rates 
however  a significant rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicle sales  because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues 
given our debt composition as of december   each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense  including floor plan interest  by million 
we receive interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers  which is reflected as a reduction in the cost of inventory on the balance sheet 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical experience  that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
governmental regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  such as local licensing requirements  consumer protection and privacy laws  wage and hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws  and environmental requirements governing  among other things  discharges into the air and water  above ground and underground storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases 
if we or our employees at the individual dealerships violate these laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties  or a cease and desist order may be issued against our operations that are not in compliance 
our future acquisitions may also be subject to governmental regulation  including antitrust reviews 
future laws and regulations relating to our business may be more stringent than current laws and regulations and require us to incur significant additional costs 
our business and financial results may be adversely affected by claims alleging violations of laws and regulations related to our advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities 
our business is highly regulated

the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team  particularly our senior management and service and sales personnel 
manufacturer dealer agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the efficiency and productivity of our operations

potential acquisitions are viable to us only if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner or manger of the acquired dealership retire 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment

we offer domestic and foreign brands of new vehicles  including four heavy truck brands 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve our markets 
we developed our dealership portfolio through the acquisition of large  locally branded dealership groups operating throughout the united states 
we complemented these large dealership groups with the purchase of numerous single point dealerships and small dealership groups in our existing market areas referred to as tuck in acquisitions 
we continue to use tuck in acquisitions to increase the number of vehicle brands we offer in a particular market area and to create a larger gross profit base over which to spread overhead costs 
our retail network is currently organized into four regions and includes ten dealership groups i florida comprising our coggin dealerships  operating primarily in jacksonville and orlando  and our courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  ii west comprising our mcdavid dealerships operating throughout texas and our spirit honda dealership operating in los angeles  california  iii mid atlantic comprising our crown dealerships operating in north carolina  south carolina and southern virginia and iv south comprising our nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia and our north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas 
our plaza dealerships operating in st 
louis  missouri  our gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi and our northern california dealerships operating in sacramento and fresno  remain standalone operations 
our revenues are derived primarily from four offerings i the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new retail and the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet the terms new retail and fleet being collectively referred to as new  ii the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used  iii maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts collectively referred to as fixed operations  and iv the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of various insurance and warranty products collectively referred to as f i 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle retailed pvr  our fixed operations based on aggregate gross profit  and f i based on dealership generated f i pvr 
we assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit by comparing the year to year results of stores that we have operated for at least twelve months 
the organic growth of our business is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy as well as our strong brand mix  which is heavily weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands 
sales of vehicles particularly new vehicles have historically fluctuated with general macroeconomic conditions  including consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit and fuel prices 
we believe that any future negative trends in new vehicle sales will be mitigated by i the stability of our fixed operations  ii increased used vehicle sales  iii our variable cost structure and iv our advantageous brand mix 
historically  our brand mix has been less affected by market volatility than the us automobile industry as a whole 
we expect the recent industry wide gain in market share of the luxury and mid line import brands to continue in the near future 
our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of new vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales and fixed operations 
as a result  when used vehicles and fixed operations revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase 
we continue to implement new initiatives specifically designed to accelerate the growth of our high margin businesses and to leverage our selling  general and administrative sg a expense structure 
sg a expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other customary operating expenses 
a significant portion of our selling expenses is variable such as sales commissions  or controllable expenses such as advertising  generally allowing our cost structure to adapt in response to trends in our business 
we evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit and all other sg a expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit 
our operations are generally subject to seasonal variations as we tend to generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
generally  the seasonal variations in our operations are caused by factors relating to weather conditions  changes in manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns  among other things 
over the past several years  certain automobile manufacturers have used a combination of vehicle pricing and financing incentive programs to generate increased customer demand for new vehicles 
we anticipate that the manufacturers will continue to use these incentive programs in the near future to drive demand for their product offerings

the increase in adjusted income from continuing operations resulted from several factors  including i a million increase in fixed operations gross profit and a million increase in used vehicle gross profit as a result of our continued focus on our high margin businesses  ii the performance of our new retail business  which delivered a million increase in gross profit  and iii expense control initiatives that reduced personnel and advertising costs  which together contributed to a basis point of the overall basis point improvement in adjusted sg a expenses as a percentage of adjusted gross profit 
these factors were partially offset by a increase in floor plan interest expense as a result of a basis point increase in short term interest rates 
total revenues increased billion to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  the increase in total revenues was a result of a million increase in new vehicle revenue and a million  increase in used vehicle revenue 
total gross profit increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total gross profit  excluding the corporate generated f i gain of million  increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in total gross profit was driven by strong performances across all of our businesses  lead by a million increase in fixed operations gross profit

new vehicle revenues increased billion to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  the increase in new vehicle revenues was a result of a million increase in new vehicle revenue from our heavy trucks business and a million increase in our same store new retail revenue from mid line import brands offset most notably by a decrease in mid line domestic  which decreased million as a result of their continued loss of market share 
we saw a significant demand for new heavy trucks during due to changes in emission laws effective in january which we anticipate will increase the average cost of a new heavy truck by approximately  per unit 
new vehicle revenues excluding heavy trucks passenger vehicle were flat at billion for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  our passenger vehicle unit sales  which decreased  were not as adversely impacted by the challenging new retail market as was the overall us passenger vehicle industry  which decreased approximately 
we continue to benefit from our strong brand mix  heavily weighted toward luxury and mid line import brands that continue to increase their market share 
new vehicle gross profit increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  new retail gross profit increased million driven by i a increase in mid line import same store retail gross profit as these brands continued to increase their market share  ii a increase from our heavy trucks business and iii our ability to capitalize on manufacturer incentive programs 
these increases in same store retail gross profit were partially offset by the performance of our mid line domestic and value brands  which were down and  respectively  with the majority of the decrease resulting from the continued loss of market share for the domestic brands 
we expect our passenger vehicle unit sales  revenue and gross profit to increase in the future despite a flat overall us passenger retail unit sales environment as the luxury and mid line import brands will continue to increase market share 
however  we expect heavy trucks unit sales  revenue and gross profit to decrease significantly in as the new emission laws will significantly increase the price of heavy trucks resulting in a temporary reduction in demand for heavy trucks produced in the near future 
however  we believe we will mitigate some of this decrease as we strategically increased our inventory of model year heavy trucks because model year heavy trucks will not be required to adhere to the new emission laws

used vehicle gross profit increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  used retail gross profit increased million to million as a result of a increase in used retail unit sales and an increase in used retail gross profit pvr 
the increases in our used retail units sales and used gross profit pvr is a result of i our investment in software to better value trade ins and improve inventory management  ii the execution by our regional management teams dedicated to the used vehicle business and iii the implementation of a used vehicle certification program

other income expense floor plan interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  approximately of this increase was the result of a basis point increase in short term interest rates over last year  approximately of the increase was the result of higher average inventory levels during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and the remaining was the result of terminating two cash flow swaps on our floor plan notes payable during the first quarter of we expect floor plan expense to fluctuate with changes in our inventory levels in the near future as we anticipate that short term interest rates will remain at their current level 
other interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase in other interest expense is a result of a higher effective interest rate on our notes due to the termination of a fair value swap on our notes

application of critical accounting estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting estimates described below are those that require management judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method to value our vehicle inventories and the first in  first out method fifo to account for our parts inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
in assessing lower of cost or market for new and used vehicles  we consider i the aging of new and used vehicles  ii loss histories of new and used vehicles  iii the timing of annual and model changeovers of new vehicles and iv current market conditions 
we very rarely sell new vehicles that have been in inventory for less than days at a loss 
our new vehicle loss histories have indicated that our losses range between of our new vehicle inventory that exceeded days old 
as of december   our new vehicle loss reserve was million or of new vehicle inventory over days old 
each change in our estimate would change our new vehicle reserve approximately million 
our used vehicle loss histories have indicated that our losses range between of our used vehicle inventory 
as of december   our used vehicle loss reserve was million or of used vehicle inventory 
each change in our estimate would change our used vehicle reserve approximately million 
notes receivable finance contracts as of december  and  we had outstanding notes receivable from finance contracts of million and million  respectively 
these notes have initial terms ranging from to months  and are collateralized by the related vehicles 
the assessment of our allowance for credit losses considers historical loss ratios and the performance of the current portfolio with respect to past due accounts 
we continually analyze our current portfolio against our historical performance 
in addition  we attribute minimal value to the underlying collateral in our assessment of the reserve 
our loss histories indicate our future credit losses will be approximately of notes receivable 
our allowance for credit losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
each change in our estimate would change our credit loss reserve approximately million 
f i chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts  credit life insurance and disability insurance to customers 
in addition  we receive commissions from financing institutions for arranging customer financing 
we may be charged back chargebacks for finance  insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event a contract is terminated 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time the vehicles are sold and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
our loss histories vary depending on the product but generally range between and 
our chargeback reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a change in our estimate for all our products would have changed our finance and insurance  net by approximately million 
insurance reserves we are self insured for certain employee medical  workers compensation and general liability claims

as of december   we had million of insurance reserves for both known and unknown employee medical  workers compensation and general liability claims 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of the businesses acquired over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets 
we have determined that based on how we operate our business  allocate resources  and regularly review our financial data and operating results that we qualify as a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
we evaluate our operations and financial results in the aggregate by dealership 
the dealership general managers are responsible for customer facing activities  including inventory management and advertising and personnel decisions  and have the flexibility to respond to local market conditions 
the corporate management team  with input from the regional management teams  is responsible for infrastructure and general strategy decisions 
the fair market value of our manufacturer franchise rights is determined at the acquisition date through discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise 
we have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no legal  contractual  economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names 
due to the fact that manufacturer franchise rights are specific to the location in which we acquire a dealership  we have determined that the dealership is the reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually on october st of each year  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the related fair market value of our underlying businesses 
all other intangible assets are deemed to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the asset ranging from to years and are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired 
related party transactions certain of our directors  shareholders and their affiliates  and regional management  have engaged in transactions with us

sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
when the effect of initial adoption is material  companies will record the effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
the provisions of sab are effective for the year ending december  the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

reconciliation of non gaap financial information floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and our agreements with our floor plan providers require us to repay amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle immediately after that vehicle is sold 
as a result  changes in floor plan notes payable are directly linked to changes in new vehicle inventory  and therefore are an integral part of understanding changes in our working capital and operating cash flow 
consequently  we have provided a reconciliation of cash provided by used in operating activities and financing activities  as if all changes in floor plan notes payable were classified as an operating activity

during  we renegotiated a contract with one of our third party f i product providers  which resulted in the recognition of income that was not attributable to retail vehicles sold during the year 
we believe that dealership generated f i  which excludes the additional revenue derived from contracts negotiated by our corporate office  provides a more accurate measure of our f i operating performance 
the following table reconciles f i  net to dealership generated f i  and provides the necessary components to calculate dealership generated f i pvr in thousands  except for unit and per vehicle data for the years ended december  f i  net as reported less corporate generated f i gross profit less corporate generated f i gain dealership generated f i retail units sold new retail units used retail units total adjusted sg a expenses as a percentage of adjusted gross profit our sg a expense was impacted by i the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
based on million of total variable rate debt including floor plan notes payable outstanding as of december   a change in interest rates would result in a change of approximately million to our annual other interest expense 
we received million of interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  interest credit assistance reduced cost of sales for the year ended december  by million and reduced new vehicle inventory by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical data  that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
hedging risk in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million as a hedge against the changes in interest rates of our variable rate floor plan notes payable for a period of two years beginning in november the swap agreement was designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge of future changes in interest rates of our variable rate floor plan notes payable 
we do not expect this cash flow hedge to contain any ineffectiveness 
as of december   the swap agreement had a fair value of million  which was included in other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
three of our interest rate swap agreements terminated in march  which resulted in a cash payment of million  which equaled the fair market value of the swap agreements 
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million million  net of tax of unrecognized amortization related to our two terminated cash flow swaps  which are being amortized through march as a component of floor plan interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
amortization of these terminated cash flow swaps will total million for the year ended december  in addition  included as a reduction to our notes as of december  was million of unrecognized amortization related to our terminated fair value swap  which is being amortized through march as a component of other interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
amortization of this terminated fair value swap will total million for the year ended december  we have an interest rate swap with a current notional principal amount of million 
the swap was designed to provide a hedge against changes in interest rates of our variable rate mortgage notes payable through maturity in june this interest rate swap qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and may contain minor ineffectiveness 
under the terms of the swap agreement  we make payments based on a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate cash flows based on one month libor 
as of december  and  the swap agreement had a fair value of million  which was included in other long term assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we incurred minor ineffectiveness during
