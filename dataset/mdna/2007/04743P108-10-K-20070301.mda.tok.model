we have a broad base of leading personal computer original equipment manufacturer  or pc oem  customers  including acer  apple  fujitsu  lenovo  nec  and toshiba and networking equipment manufacturers  including wire  com  belkin  cisco systems  d link  linksys  nec at  netgear  siemens and tp link  as well as other consumer electronics customers 
in  we introduced our solution for the pas cellular market 
our highly integrated pas solution is used in both handset and base station products sold primarily in the china market 
our solution consists of a single chip that implements a complete cellular transceiver  baseband  application processor  audio paths  power management  keyboard  speaker and display interfaces 
pas  which is widely deployed in china  japan and taiwan  is an advanced time division multiple access time division duplex  or tdma tdd  technology operating at gigahertz  or ghz  providing high quality voice  advanced data services and long battery life 
our unique  highly integrated single chip solution for pas products provides full support for the pas networking standard and a robust set of product features at a competitive price 
our primary customer for our pas products is utstarcom 
in august  we began shipping our low cost  universal serial bus  or usb  solution for wlan which we obtained through our acquisition of zydas technology corporation  or zydas 
zydas was a privately held  taiwan based integrated circuit design company specializing in high performance wlan semiconductor and software solutions and in conjunction with the acquisition  they became the atheros taiwan development center 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock at closing and agreed to pay additional consideration upon attaining certain defined milestones 
the results of operations of zydas have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 

table of contents in december  we acquired of the outstanding shares of attansic technology corporation  or attansic  a privately held taiwan based fabless integrated circuit design company  specializing in gigabit and fast ethernet integrated circuit solutions  as well as power management products 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock 
we intend to acquire the remainder of attansics capital stock as soon as practicable for approximately million 
in december  we began shipping the ethernet solutions acquired from attansic for personal computers applications 
our ethernet solutions are integrated into personal computer lan on motherboards lom  by supplying gigabit ethernet network interface card  or nic  and physical layer  or phy  products for loms 
in january  we sold certain assets related to the legacy power management business of attansic to a third party 
the results of operations for attansic have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since december  we have provided certain supplemental pro forma information for the acquisition in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wlan chipset products and pas chip products  and  to a lesser extent  from ethernet chip solutions and licensed software and services 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
original equipment manufacturers  or oems  utilize our chipsets in developing their wireless system solutions such as access points  routers  embedded laptop clients  handsets  cardbus  minicard and other integrated circuit card products 
oems utilize our ethernet chip solutions in developing local area network  or lan  solutions such as loms 
some oems purchase chipsets directly from us and manufacture their products 
other oems utilize original design manufacturers  or odms  to design and build subsystem products that the oem then purchases from the odm and incorporates into the oem s wireless system solution 
accordingly  we ship our products either directly to the oem or to the odm based on the requirements of each oem 
purchase orders are received from an oem or an odm and we generally recognize revenue based on the shipment of chipsets to this customer 
a single odm usually provides our chipsets to numerous oems 
however  we attempt to maintain a close relationship with the target oem to monitor end market demand 
due to the use of odms  our direct customer base is relatively concentrated  although we believe that the number of total oems who purchase our chipsets through odms is broader 
we anticipate that we may continue to experience changes in our odm customer base as our end customers change odms for a variety of reasons while still using our chipsets 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual sales data submitted by the customers differs significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue in particular periods 
we expect to continue to have major concentrations of sales to a relatively small number of odm and oem customers 
the following table shows the customers that represented greater than of revenue for the years ended december   and december  hon hai precision industry co 
ltd 
utstarcom  inc alpha networks  inc cameo communications  inc askey computer corporation less than in the applicable period 
substantially all of our sales are to customers outside the united states and canada 
sales to customers in asia accounted for  and of net revenue in the year ended december   and 
table of contents respectively 
because many of our odm customers are located in asia  we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to customers in that region 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers are then sold through to oems outside of asia 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold relates primarily to the purchase of silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  test and inbound and outbound shipping of our chipsets  costs of personnel  materials and occupancy associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  royalty costs and writedowns to state inventory at the lower of cost or market caused by product obsolescence and transitions from older to newer products 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes accruals for warranty obligations  which we record when revenue is recognized 
because we do not have long term  fixed supply agreements  our wafer  assembly and test costs are subject to changes based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from foundries  we also bear the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into finished goods 
research and development 
research and development expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs related to development employees and contractors  mask and reticle costs  prototype wafers  software and computer aided design software licenses  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  regulatory testing costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we invest to develop new products to be competitive and address new markets in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and selling personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  public relations  promotional and other marketing expenses  expenses for travel  trade shows and depreciation and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  professional fees and banking fees  charges related to allowance for doubtful accounts and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our business 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the zydas and attansic acquisitions 
acquisition related identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years for purchased technology  two to three years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development relates to the in process research and development expensed upon the acquisition of zydas and attansic as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
interest income and expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
interest expense consists of interest on our revolving line of credit  equipment loans and equipment lease 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a net income tax expense of million in which was partially offset by an income tax benefit of million related to the release of valuation allowance against our 
table of contents deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  which included million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the tax expense of  in consists primarily of us alternative minimum tax and foreign income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of our wireless and ethernet chipsets 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
estimated incentive amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and are based on agreements between us and our customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual claims submitted by the customers differ significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period 
inventory valuation 
we continually assess the recoverability of our inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales 
we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost using the first in  first out method or its current estimated market value 
we reduce our inventory to the estimated lower of cost or market value to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability 
reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options rather than adopting the alternative fair value accounting provided under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 

therefore  we did not record any compensation expense for stock options we granted to our employees where the exercise price equaled the fair market value of 
table of contents the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period were fixed 
we complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  which require that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
effective january  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation expense for stock based awards granted by us as a public company prior to  but not yet vested as of january   is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
for stock based awards granted before november  the date on which we filed our registration statement for our initial public offering  we continue to record compensation expense following the provisions of apb stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans  net of estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black sholes option valuation model and the assumptions used shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options based on the expected terms of similar entities since we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of our stock option awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on considerations of the implied volatility of long term options traded on the open market and our average historical volatilities and those of similar entities since we do not have sufficient historical volatility to be able to make that determination based solely on our equity instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make collection of our accounts receivable more difficult  require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and negatively affect our working capital 
product warranty provision 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our chipset suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacement chipsets and inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we continuously monitor chipset returns for warranty and maintain an accrual for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual failure rates  cost of chipset replacement and inbound and outbound freight costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual would be required 
any such revisions may have the effect of increasing or decreasing gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period in which these estimates are adjusted 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered historical levels of income  expectations 
table of contents and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
on a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we amortize acquisition related identified intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to three years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 we measure and test goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exit 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have one reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit by taking the market capitalization of the reporting unit as determined through quoted market prices 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
we only perform the second step of the process if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill an impairment exists and is recorded 
we have not been required to perform this second step of the process since our implementation of sfas no 
because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the net book value at every measurement date 
long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets  including other purchased intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
our estimates regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows  the remaining economic life of the products and technologies  or both  may differ from those used to assess the recoverability of assets 
in that event  impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets may be required  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are made

as a result  the total number of chipsets shipped approximately doubled in compared to the increase in chipsets shipped was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price as we aggressively priced our products to pursue market share 
in addition  the acquisitions of zydas and attansic added products to our portfolio with lower average selling prices than our other products and provided incremental revenue in gross profit years ended december  change in gross profit of net revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased in the year ended december   compared to the year ended primarily as a result of a greater concentration in higher margin products as a percentage of our

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the first quarter of 
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets during  we recorded a total of million in charges related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the zydas and attansic acquisitions 
acquisition related identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to three years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
acquired in process research and development during  we recorded in process research and development charges totaling million resulting from the zydas and attansic acquisitions

at december   we reassessed the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would not be required 
accordingly  we released a portion of the valuation allowance in the amount of million that was previously recorded against our deferred tax assets  partially offset by income tax expense for us alternative minimum tax and foreign taxes  resulting in a net income tax benefit of million for 
table of contents years ended december  and tables presented in thousands  except percentage amounts net revenue years ended december  change in net revenue the increase in net revenue was due to the increased volume of chipsets shipped as a result of increased acceptance of our wireless chipset products  the continued migration from our multi chip solution products to our single chip solution products  increased market demand for wireless networking products and the introduction of our cellular solution for pas products 
as a result  the total number of chipsets shipped increased from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase in chipsets shipped was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price as we competitively priced our chipsets to aggressively pursue market share 
additionally  our single chipset solutions are generally priced lower than the combined average selling prices of our multi chip solutions

in addition  in the decrease in higher margin a g products as a percentage of our total product mix adversely affected the gross profit percentage 
research and development years ended december  change in research and development of net revenue the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in compensation related costs of million  primarily attributable to a increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in in addition  there were increases in equipment related expenses and costs of additional software development licenses of  related to development of new products 
sales and marketing years ended december  change in sales and marketing of net revenue

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of december   consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and our revolving credit facility  under which million was available to borrow 
we issued a standby letter of credit for million to secure an operating lease for equipment during which reduced the amount available to borrow under this credit facility from million to million 
in february  we raised million in our initial public offering of common stock 
prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock  capital equipment loans and lease lines and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
operating activities 
our operating activities provided cash in the amount of million and million in and  respectively and used cash in the amount of million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in  compared to  and in  compared to was primarily due to the following operating activities 
our net income was million  million and million in  and respectively 
included in our net income was million representing our non cash stock based compensation expense  net of excess tax benefits from employee stock awards 
stock based compensation was million and million in and  respectively 
in  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  resulting in higher charges for stock based compensation and higher excess tax benefits from employee stock awards than in years prior to  when we recorded stock based compensation pursuant to the provisions of apb no 
and sfas no 
in  we expensed million in non cash amortization and write offs of acquired intangible assets  acquired in process research and development and other charges related to the acquisitions of zydas and attansic 
there were no acquisition related expenses in and  as we made no acquisitions prior to accounts receivable increased by million in as a result of increased revenue and the timing of customer payments  decreased by million in  related to improved collection efforts and increased million in  related to increased revenue and the timing of customer payments 
our inventory increased by million  million and million in  and  respectively  to meet the increased customer demand for our products 
accounts payable decreased by  in  increased by million in and decreased by million in the changes in accounts payable in  and were primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases to meet the demand for our products and the timing of payments to our vendors 
our accrued and other liabilities increased by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in primarily related to a million increase in accrued customer incentives associated with the increase in revenue during the year  a million increase in income taxes payable resulting from the excess tax benefit from employee stock awards arising from the adoption of sfas no 
r and a million increase in accrued compensation and benefits  associated with an increase in our headcount 
the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in accrued compensation and benefits  associated with an increase in our headcount 
the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in accrued customer incentives associated with a revenue increase during the year 
investing activities 
our investing activities used million in  primarily due to the million  net of cash acquired  we paid to acquire zydas and attansic in  partially offset by maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases 
our investing activities provided million in  primarily resulting from maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and purchase of property and equipment 
our investing activities used million in  primarily due to the purchases of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by maturities of marketable securities 
capital expenditures were million  million  million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in and primarily consisted of computer and test equipment purchases and 
table of contents software purchases 
capital expenditures in primarily consisted of leasehold improvements for our corporate headquarters and computer and test equipment purchases 
we anticipate capital expenditures will increase in in order to support future growth 
financing activities 
our financing activities provided cash of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities in related primarily to the exercise of employee options to purchase our common stock  purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and the estimated tax benefits arising from stock compensation recorded in pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
financing activities in related primarily to the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayment of an equipment loan 
financing activities in primarily represented proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our initial public offering of million  the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings  equipment loans and capital lease obligations 
we have a revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides financing up to million for working capital requirements 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire on march  but we anticipate that we will renew the facility for an additional year 
in  we issued a standby letter of credit for million to secure an operating lease for equipment which reduced the amount available to borrow under this credit facility to million 
at december   no balances were outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated at the bank s prime rate 
the loan is collateralized by all of our tangible assets 
the loan agreement contains financial and nonfinancial covenants with which we must comply 
through december   we were in compliance with all required covenants 
we expect to experience a significant increase in our operating expenses in absolute dollars  particularly in research  and development but also in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that research and development is essential to expanding our core technologies and product offerings 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenditures resulted in enhancement of our product offerings  technological know how and inventions that have yielded numerous issued and pending us patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and intend to fund these expenses with operating cash flow  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in august  we acquired zydas for an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock at closing and agreed to pay additional consideration upon attaining certain defined milestones 
in december we acquired of the outstanding shares of attansic 
under the terms of the agreement  the acquisition price was million consisting of million in cash and million in our common stock 
we may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to potential investments in  acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize the income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on our interest income 
as of december   our investments were in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  corporate bonds  market auction preferred stock and us government securities 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands  except percentages that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less maturing between three months and one year maturing greater than one year total fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides financing up to million for working capital requirements 
in  we issued a standby letter of credit for million to secure an operating lease for equipment which reduced the amount available to borrow under this credit facility from million to million 
at december   no balances were outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
the loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate 
we do not believe that a change in the prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  nor do we believe that we have a material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk
