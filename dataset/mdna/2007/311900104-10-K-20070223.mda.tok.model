part i item business fastenal company fastenal and  together with our wholly owned subsidiaries  hereinafter referred to as fastenal or by terms such as we  our  or us began as a partnership in  and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in as of december   we had  store sites located in states  puerto rico  canada  mexico  singapore  china  and the netherlands  and employed  people at these sites 
we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion 
as of december  these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below 
our internet address for corporate and investor information is www 
fastenal 
com 
the information contained on this website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k and should not be considered part of this report 
we operated twelve distribution centers in north america as of december  from which we distribute products to our store sites 
development of the business fastenal began in with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small  medium sized  and  in subsequent years  large cities 
we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 
we opened our first store site in winona  minnesota  a city with a population of approximately  the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store sites at the end of each of the last ten years net sales in millions number of store sites at year end as of december  and  respectively  we operated store sites in geographic location united states puerto rico canada mexico singapore netherlands china we have closed only ten stores in our history 
three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of our product line or the expansion of our distribution network improved the profitability of the locations 
we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network  population statistics  and employment data for manufacturing and construction 
we intend to continue opening new store sites and currently expect the rate of new store openings to be approximately to per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year 
we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines 
subsequent to opening  store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 
we currently have several versions of store locations 
the majority of our stores operate under our expected inventory format 
this format was also referred to as the csp or customer service project format 
since we have also had a csp format 
this format is an expansion of the stocking pattern of the first type 
we had of this type of store at december  during we created two new formats called the strategic account store and csp the strategic account store format focuses on the needs of strategic customers in the local markets and stocks product to serve this need 
we had five of this type of store at december  the csp store format is a prototype store to test the potential expansion of our current standard product offerings 
we had one of this type of store at december  and plan to open seven to nine more in we believe  based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america  that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least  total stores 
many of the new store sites may be in cities in which we currently operate 
fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 
in addition to the store types discussed above  we also operate in plant sites 
an in plant site is a selling unit located in or near a customer s facility that sells product solely to that customer 
these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 
we opened the following store sites in the last five years united states puerto rico canada mexico singapore netherlands china total openings we plan to open additional store sites outside of the united states in the future 
the store sites located outside the united states contributed approximately of our consolidated net sales in with approximately of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 
no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved  or that new stores  once opened  will be profitable 
it has been our experience that near term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites 
this adverse effect is due to the start up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base 
a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls  a slow process involving repeated contacts 
as a result of this process  sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month 
of the stores opened in the first quarter of  were profitable in the fourth quarter of for  annual sales volumes of stores operating at least five years ranged between approximately and  with of these stores having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately to  the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of our stores from to based on the age of each store 
the stores opened in contributed approximately  or approximately of our consolidated net sales in  with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to age of store site as of december  year opened number of store sites in group as of december  average sales average sales percent change year old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old during  we began to directly allocate all sales adjustments primarily customer rebates to the individual selling locations identified in this table 
the presentation has been adjusted to reflect this change 
the average sales include sales of store sites open for less than the full fiscal year 
as of december   we operated distribution centers in or near winona  minnesota  indianapolis  indiana  dallas  texas  atlanta  georgia  scranton  pennsylvania  modesto  california  seattle  washington  akron  ohio  salt lake city  utah  greensboro  north carolina  kansas city  kansas  and toronto  ontario 
these twelve distribution centers give us over million square feet of distribution capacity 
these distribution centers are located so as to permit twice a week to five times a week deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier 
approximately of our stores receive deliveries five times a week 
as the number of stores increases  we intend to add new distribution centers 
we operate a central unix terminal based computer system allowing automatic data exchange between our stores and our distribution centers 
this system consists of both customized and purchased software 
the use of client server technology allows our network of unix based machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations and is provided to authorized users via a dedicated wide area network wan 
at the store level  we operate a proprietary point of sale pos system that operates on a microsoft windows operating system 
the data exchange between the centrally located systems and pos is monitored and controlled centrally 
trademarks and service marks we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks  including fastenal with various designs or tag lines  fas n it  fnl  blackstone  and fnl g 
although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks  we consider the fastenal name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 
products our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies  many of which are sold under the fastenal product name 
this product line  which we refer to as the fastener product line  consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners  such as bolts  nuts  screws  studs  and related washers  and miscellaneous supplies  such as paints  various pins and machinery keys  concrete anchors  batteries  sealants  metal framing systems  wire rope  strut  private label stud anchors  rivets  and related accessories 
threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects  and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures 
many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities 
variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market 
therefore  we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 
threaded fasteners accounted for approximately of the fastener product line sales in   and and approximately   and of our consolidated net sales in   and  respectively 
concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastener product line 
most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 
since  we have added additional product lines 
these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line 
our product lines include the following product line year introduced approximate number of stock items private label product name fasteners  fastenal  fnl g tools and equipment  fasttool  blackstone cutting tools and abrasives  sharpcut  blackstone hydraulics  pneumatics  plumbing and hvac  fastenal material handling  storage  and packaging  equiprite janitorial supplies  chemicals  and paints  cleanchoice  blackstone electrical supplies  powerphase  blackstone welding supplies  fastarc  blackstone safety supplies  fastenal metals  alloys  and materials  fastenal we do not sell welding gases 
we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 
inventory control our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems  our sales personnel at the store  district  and region levels  and our product managers 
the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores  from individual stores  and from geographic areas 
it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information 
the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment  or prompts a buyer to purchase  as necessary  based on an established minimum maximum level 
all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers 
inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers 
manufacturing and support services operations in  approximately of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards 
the remaining of our consolidated net sales for related to products manufactured  modified or repaired by our manufacturing division or our support services 
the manufactured products consist primarily of non standard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers specifications 
the services provided by the support services group include  but are not limited to  items such as tool repair  band saw blade welding  third party logistics  and light manufacturing 
we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of to of our consolidated net sales 
sources of supply we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately  standard stock items we distribute 
most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources  although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control 
no single supplier accounted for more than of our purchases in geographic information information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report for the fiscal year ended december   which is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign currency fluctuations  changes in trade relations  or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 
customers and marketing we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations  and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees 
most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets 
the construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations 
other users of our products include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
as of december   our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last days was approximately  during each of the three years ended december   no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales 
we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent  provide some protection to us from economic downturns in a particular market 
store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers 
because of the nature of our business  we make limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television  radio  and newspapers 
the forms of advertising we use include signs  catalogs  and direct mailings 
competition our business is highly competitive 
competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service and convenience 
some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses  while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales 
we  however  believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small  medium  and large markets  each offering a wide variety of products  is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area  taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers  makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products 
having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 
employees as of december   we employed a total of  full and part time employees   being store managers and store employees  and the balance being employed in our distribution centers  manufacturing operations  service operations  and home office 
we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets 
we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs see the description of the fastenal school of business below and by decentralizing decision making 
wherever possible  promotions are from within our organization 
for example  most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position or from an assistant manager s position  and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 
the fastenal school of business develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all fastenal employees 
our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance 
in addition  we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning 
these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business 
these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership  effective store best practices  sales and marketing  product education  and distribution 
our sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis  while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections 
as a result  a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume 
we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth  profit growth before and after taxes  profitability  and return on assets  and to our other personnel for achieving pre determined cost containment goals 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages 
we believe our employee relations are good

risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business 
our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending  which could harm our operating results 
in general  our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers 
this spending is affected by many factors  including  among others general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  fuel prices and electrical power rates  unemployment trends  terrorist attacks and acts of war  and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our established stores more than two years old and their level of profitability 
our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 
one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets 
based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the us  canada  and mexico  we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately  stores 
we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity 
in addition  a particular local market s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor s store 
we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 
our growth is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers  and the most effective way to attract new customers is by opening new stores 
our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately to each year  which is consistent with our historical average 
failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our long term growth 
neither our current business strategy that focuses on stores with an industrial leaning retail look and feel nor our new business strategy of opening certain stores with additional product selection has been proven successful on a long term basis 
in  we began implementing our current business strategy that focuses on store locations with an industrial leaning retail look and feel  which we refer to as the customer service project or csp 
the viability of this business strategy has not been proven on a long term basis 
we recently transitioned from opening csp stores to expanding certain stores with additional product selection  which requires an additional thousand in inventory  two additional sales specialists and two additional vehicles in each store 
we refer to this new  larger store format as csp the results we achieved at our csp format stores may not be indicative of the results we will achieve at our csp format stores 
the new format increases our operating costs per store  but may not lead to proportionately increased revenues per store 
our mix of higher and lower margin merchandise in the csp stores differs from the merchandise mix in our smaller stores and  therefore  may negatively impact our gross margins in our larger format stores 
in addition  we may not carry the appropriate merchandise mix during the appropriate time of year in our larger format stores 
we cannot assure our success in operating the csp format stores on a profitable basis 
if a csp format store is unprofitable  the impact on our financial results could be greater than the impact of an unprofitable smaller format store 
lower volume orders and changes in our customers and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 
from time to time  we have experienced changes in product mix and inbound inventory costs 
for example  marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past 
when we change our product mix  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to incrementally increase our gross margin percentage by varying product mix as we have over the last several years 
changes in our customers  product mix  or the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline 
opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 
we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy 
new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation  and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability 
a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls  a slow process involving repeated contacts 
in new markets  we have less familiarity with local customer preferences  and customers in these markets are less familiar with fastenal s name and capabilities 
in addition  entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new  unfamiliar competitors 
we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 
new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 
while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth  the first year sales in new stores are low  and the added expenses relating to payroll  occupancy  and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings 
it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 
the ability to identify new products and products lines  and integrate them into our store and distribution network  may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customer s needs 
we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products 
in addition  our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 
increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses  which may result in lower operating margins 
costs of raw materials used in our products eg  steel and energy costs have been rising during the last several years  which has resulted in increased production costs for our vendors 
those vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases 
the fuel costs of our distribution operation have risen as well 
while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact  we may not be successful 
failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 
our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs  sales at existing stores  and the rate of new store openings 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including store managers and store associates  who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers 
qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas  and the turnover rate in the industry is high 
if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service  as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge  our sales could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees 
an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores 
any such delays  any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores  or any increases in labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 
our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy 
disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports  due to events such as the hurricanes of and the longshoreman s strike on the west coast in  may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 
because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 
we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors  which could harm our business and operating results 
the industrial  construction  and maintenance supply industry  although consolidating  still remains a large  fragmented industry that is highly competitive 
we believe that sales of industrial  construction  and maintenance industry supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years  which may make the industry even more competitive 
our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence  name recognition  and financial  marketing  and other resources  and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection  financial resources  and services 
increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sale methods could cause us to lose market share or to reduce our prices or increase our spending  thus eroding our margins 
our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions  political situations  and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries  over which we have no control 
we obtain certain of our products  and our suppliers obtain certain of their products  from china  taiwan  south korea  mexico and other foreign countries 
our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor s control  including foreign government regulations  political unrest  war  disruption or delays in shipments  changes in local economic conditions and trade issues 
our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 
the industrial  construction  and maintenance supply industry is consolidating  which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 
the industrial  construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating 
this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities  which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers 
customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations 
we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 
there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation 
the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins 
furthermore  as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition  and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses  we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects
