the company engages or participates in remedial and other environmental compliance activities at certain of these sites 
at other sites  the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste 
the company s management reviews each individual site  considering the number of parties involved  the level of potential liability or contribution of the company relative to the other parties  the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved  the method and extent of remediation  the potential insurance coverage  the estimated legal and consulting expense with respect to each site  and the time period over which any costs would likely be incurred 
based on the above analysis  management estimates the remediation or other clean up costs and related claims for each site 
the estimates are based in part on discussions with other prps  governmental agencies and engineering firms 
the company accrues appropriate reserves for potential environmental liabilities  which are continually reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
while uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the company s ultimate environmental liabilities  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that such liabilities  individually and in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the company is involved in a variety of legal claims and proceedings relating to personal injury  product liability  warranties  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these claims and proceedings include cases where the company is one of a number of defendants in proceedings alleging that the plaintiffs suffered injuries or contracted diseases from exposure to chemicals or other ingredients used in the production of some of the company s products or waste disposal 
the company believes these claims and proceedings are not out of the ordinary course for a business of the type and size in which it is engaged 
while the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that the costs and liabilities of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable revenue recognition other than extended furniture protection plans  revenue from sales is recognized at the time of product delivery  passage of title  a sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in revenue as the products are sold 
the company sells extended furniture protection plans for which revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract 
an actuarial study utilizing historical claims data is used to forecast claims payments over the contract period  and revenue is recognized based on the forecasted claims payments 
actual claims costs are reflected in earnings in the period incurred 
anticipated losses on programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
the most important factors considered by the company in reviewing its furniture protection plan business and estimating future claims expense are the number of claims submitted frequency and the dollar amount per claim severity 
based on analyses of claim frequency and claim severity under the plan and estimates of future claims  the company recorded a pre tax charge of  in during  following a comprehensive review of this business  the company implemented a number of strategic initiatives and operational changes  including changes in the terms of the plans and changes in the company s claims administration policies 
based on claim frequency and claim severity decreases  the company reduced the accrual by  in in  the company also began to analyze when an open claim is inactive and unlikely to require any payment 
as a result of a decrease in claim frequency from to and the analysis of open claims  the company reduced the accrual by an additional  in in and  the company did not experience a significant change in the frequency or severity of claims for plans sold in or prior years 
the majority of the plans related to and prior years will expire in  and we do not expect any significant change to the frequency or severity of claims 
supplier and customer rebates the company records supplier and customer rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold or a reduction to revenue  respectively  as they are earned  in accordance with the underlying agreement 
the customer rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the customer s purchases 
customer rebates that increase based on different levels of sales volume are recognized immediately when the current activity plus expected volume triggers a higher earned rebate 
the supplier rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the company s purchases 
supplier rebates that increase based on different levels of purchases are recognized when there is certainty that the current level of purchases will trigger a higher rebate earned 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists and relationships  purchased technology and patents and trademarks 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill for each reporting unit be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the company has five reporting units at october  see note 
the company tests goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed by sfas in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the company would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  the company would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
if the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value 
in assessing fair value  management generally utilizes present value cash flow calculations using a cash flow approach 
during the fourth quarters of and  management completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
the discount rate and sales growth assumptions are the two material assumptions utilized in the company s calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the company utilizes a cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets have historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets by a substantial amount 
the company performs a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and revenue growth assumptions 
either the discount rate could increase by of the discount rate utilized or the sales growth assumption could decline to a zero growth environment and the company s reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair value in excess of carrying value 
pension and post retirement medical obligations the company sponsors several defined benefit plans for certain hourly  salaried and foreign employees 
the company also sponsors post retirement medical benefits for certain us employees 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans in accordance with gaap  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical trend rates and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased the company s pension expense  in a increase in the medical trend rates would not have a material effect on post retirement medical expense or the post retirement benefit obligation 
see note for further details regarding accounting for pensions and post retirement medical benefits 
income taxes at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the foreign jurisdictions and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to exam 
table of contents ination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions 
we accrue a liability when we believe an assessment may be probable and the amount is estimable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of revisions to these estimates is recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes have and will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and our tax environment changes 
forward looking statements this discussion contains certain forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events 
forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside the control of the company that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
these uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  dependence of internal earnings growth on economic conditions and growth in the domestic and international coatings industry  risks related to any future acquisitions  including risks of adverse changes in the results of acquired businesses and the assumption of unforeseen liabilities  risks of disruptions in business resulting from the integration process and higher interest costs resulting from further borrowing for any such acquisitions  our reliance on the efforts of vendors  government agencies  utilities and other third parties to achieve adequate compliance and avoid disruption of our business  risks of disruptions in business resulting from the company s relationships with customers and suppliers  unusual weather conditions adversely affecting sales  changes in raw materials pricing and availability  delays in passing along cost increases to customers  changes in governmental regulation  including more stringent environmental  health and safety regulations  the nature  cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings  the outbreak of war and other significant national and international events  and other risks and uncertainties 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive  and the company disclaims any obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has not hedged its exposure to translation gains and losses  however  it has reduced its exposure by borrowing funds in local currencies 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company is also subject to interest rate risk 
at october   approximately of the company s total debt consisted of floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase from the rates in effect on october   assuming no change in debt balances  the additional interest expense would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
