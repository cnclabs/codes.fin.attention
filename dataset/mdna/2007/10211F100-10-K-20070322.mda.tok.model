executive level overview we are a medical device company engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of electrosurgical devices 
our medical products include a wide range of devices including electrosurgical generators and accessories  cauteries  medical lighting  nerve locators and other products 
we divide our operations into three reportable business segments 
electrosurgical products  battery operated cauteries and other products 
the electrosurgical segment sells electrosurgical products which include dessicators  generators  electrodes  electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products 
these products are used in surgery for the cutting and coagulation of tissue 
battery operated cauteries are used for precise hemostasis to stop bleeding in ophthalmology and in other fields 
our other revenues are derived from nerve locators  disposable and reusable penlights  medical lighting  license fees  development fees and other miscellaneous income 
domestic sales accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in and in most of the company s products are marketed through medical distributors  which distribute to more than  hospitals and to doctors and other health care facilities 
during fiscal  and  revenues from arthrex  inc  represented  and of our revenues  respectively 
for fiscal medtronic  inc revenues represented of our total revenues 
no other single end customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the fiscal   or as a result of strong domestic sales international sales represented of total revenues in as compared to in and in the company s products are sold in more than countries through local dealers 
local dealer support is coordinated by sales and marketing personnel at the st 
petersburg  florida facility 
we have no manufacturing facilities branch offices other than the florida facility 
we sell our products to distributors that distribute them in the following countries argentina  australia  austria  belgium  brazil  canada  chile  denmark  finland  france  germany  greece  india  italy  japan  korea  mexico  the netherlands  new zealand  norway  poland  portugal  singapore  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  taiwan  the united kingdom  china  the cis former soviet union  cyprus  indonesia  ireland  korea  latin america  malaysia  the philippines  thailand  turkey  and vietnam 
our business is generally not seasonal in nature 
outlook for our acquisition of intellectual properties and certain assets of lican development  ltd 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal is a clear signal that a shift away from being highly reliant on oem business and targeting substantially larger markets in electrosurgery is underway 
this direction is expected to generate greater sales and higher operating margins  which long term should result in improved earnings 
planning ahead  bovie canada represents our enthusiasm in the future 
moving forward  management estimates that the meg and polaris hand held product lines will significantly increase future revenues 
additional new products in electrosurgery will continue to be featured during and as we move into new niche markets 
for example  our icon gi  together with accessory products  will mark our entry into the gastroenterology market while other new electrosurgery products are slated for other large niche markets 
as a result of costs relating to our canada facility  over the short term  we may experience an impact to our bottom line  however  we are confident that the acquisition will be beneficial to future revenues and our products are expected to achieve greater recognition in the growing and dynamic medical equipment industry 
in addition  as these products enter various markets they can create opportunities for possible collaborative agreements with larger companies 
forecasting is admittedly a difficult task and it has always been our policy to adopt a conservative approach 
although our goals are ambitious  we believe they will be achieved 
our commitment is not just to sustain our level of growth but also to accelerate it in future years 
the outlook is based on a number of assumptions  which are subject to change  some of which are outside our control 
a variation in our assumptions may result in a change in this outlook

product development most of the company s products and product improvements have been developed internally 
funds for this development have come from internal cash flow and the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
the company maintains close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development 
new and improved products play a critical role in the company s sales growth 
the company continues to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its existing product lines 
the company has a centralized research and development focus  with its one manufacturing location responsible for new product development and product improvements 
our research  development and engineering units at the manufacturing location maintain relationships with distribution locations and customers in order to provide an understanding of changes in the market and product needs 
during and into we invested in the j plasma technology  the suture removal technology  the gastrointestinal gi device and undertook development of cardio and urological electrosurgical devices for a contractual partner 
the suture removal device  the gi device  modular laparoscopic instruments and the bovie button are being marketed  although no significant sales are anticipated until the ongoing cost for this development will be paid from operating cash flows 
in the next year we do not contemplate any material purchase or acquisition of assets that our ordinary cash flow and or credit line would be unable to sustain 
we believe that bovie has the financial resources needed to meet business requirements in the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures needed for the expansion of our manufacturing site  working capital requirements  and product development programs  subject to bovie maintaining compliance with our credit facility 
non medical products we discontinued our non medical product line in by selling our inventory at cost  and licensing our customer list and manufacturing technology to our largest customer in that field for  payable in equal installments over years 
the transaction is being accounted for as a licensing agreement over five years and in and we received income of  and  respectively  from the licensing 
reliance on collaborative  manufacturing and selling arrangements we are dependent on certain contractual oem customers for product development  wherein we are to provide the manufacturing of the product developed 
however  the customer has no legal obligation to purchase the developed products 
should the collaborative customer fail to give us purchase orders for the product after development  our future business and value of related assets could be negatively affected 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that a collaborative customer may give sufficient high priority to our products 
in addition  disagreements or disputes may arise between bovie and its contractual customers  which could adversely affect production of our products 
we also have informal collaborative arrangements with two foreign suppliers where in we request the development of certain items and components and we purchase them pursuant to purchase orders 
our purchase orders are never more than one year and are supported by orders from our customers 
in january we entered into an agreement to acquire patents and technology for endoscopic disposable and reusable modular instruments  requiring us to purchase equipment  tools and molds valued at  as part of the agreement  we retained the services of the seller and its principal at rate of  per month for one year  which ended on december   to develop commercial prototypes for marketing 
the seller  steve livneh  as of october  accepted an employment position with bovie medical 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days and days at december  and respectively 
days sales in inventory increased days to days at december  from days at december  the higher days sales in inventory is due to increased inventories resulting from additional orders to be shipped and products to be manufactured under oem contracts 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million compared to a net cash applied of 
million to operations in the increase in cash from operations in compared to the prior year is primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal for the purchase of fixed assets  an increase of million compared to cash used in fiscal net cash provided from financing activities was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal total borrowing declined by  and employees and others exercised options and purchased shares amounting to million 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december  we also had outstanding short term borrowings totaling  at that date 
we believe our cash on hand  as well as anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements  future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures and future acquisitions to supplement our current product offerings 
should additional funds be required  we have million of additional borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facility 
the company s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year  including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business  are summarized as follows in thousands payment period long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations the company s additional borrowing capacity  along with the expected expiration period of the commitments  is summarized as follows in millions amount of commitment total expiration per period amount less than in excess of committed year year secured revolving credit agreement and other lines of credit as of december the total amount is available 
our future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained herein  particularly the statements regarding growth in the medical products industry  capital spending  research and development  and marketing and general and administrative expenses  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the factors discussed above  there are other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  such as business conditions and the general economies  competitive factors including rival manufacturers availability of components at reasonable prices  risk of nonpayment of accounts receivable  risks associated with foreign operations  and litigation involving intellectual property and consumer issues 
we believe that we have the product mix  facilities  personnel  competitive edge  operating cash flows and financial resources for business success in the immediate year future and distant future after year  but future revenues  costs  margins  product mix and profits are all subject to the influence of a number of factors  as discussed above 
critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted gaap in the united states of america us our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  minority investment  legal proceedings  research and development  warranty obligations  product liability  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience  or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
occasionally  we may hold certain assets for sale 
in those cases  the assets are reclassified on our balance sheet from long term to current  and the carrying value of such assets are reviewed and adjusted each period thereafter to the fair value less expected cost to sell 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company and its affiliates by the board of directors 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with sfas statement r with option expense amortized over the vesting period based on the binomial lattice option pricing model fair value on the grant date 
the company adopted sfas r on january  see note significant accounting policies income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  we record accruals representing our best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
other matters we distribute our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound 
when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the united states dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
we manufacture our products in the united states  china  canada and bulgaria and incur the costs to manufacture in us dollars 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of the high costs of manufacturing in the us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid overnight money market investments 
to minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term overnight securities 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure
