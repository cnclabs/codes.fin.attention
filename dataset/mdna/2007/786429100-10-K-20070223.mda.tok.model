item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in millions except for ratios  per claim data and per share data  unless noted otherwise this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information for consistency with the current year presentation 
forward looking information forward looking information contained in this report is subject to risk and uncertainty 
we have made statements under the captions our business  risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k that are forward looking statements 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to investors 
however  there may be events in the future we are not able to predict accurately or that we do not fully control  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements  including changes in general economic and business conditions and in the insurance industry changes in our business strategies other factors discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k summary the following section builds upon earlier discussion and provides more information about our company and our financial performance 
we are a property and casualty p c insurance company with headquarters in seattle  washington 
we sell insurance to drivers  home owners  renters and owners and operators of small and mid sized businesses 
our business helps people protect what they value and deal with the unexpected 
our revenues come from the premiums we earn on the insurance policies we write and the income we earn from our investment of these premium dollars 
our financial results have been affected by the major strategic actions we have taken to reshape our business and become a more focused and successful competitor 
our major strategic initiatives included marketing our products in ways that mirror the diversity of consumers and their buying preferences making progress to become a low cost carrier and enhancing our competitive position managing our capital effectively investing to modernize and standardize our technology marketing our products in ways that mirror the diversity of consumers and their buying preferences we remain committed to selling our products primarily through independent agents  but we also recognize that to grow in this competitive environment  we need to market our products in ways that mirror the diversity of consumers and their buying preferences 
we continue to explore opportunities to supplement our current distribution network and reach consumers who are not buying insurance through the independent agency channel 
our online sales increased in  and we began rolling out our new optimum package with features that allow our customers to boost the value of their insurance  be rewarded for good driving and receive extra protection for emergencies and theft 

table of contents making progress to become a low cost carrier and enhancing our competitive position as a part of our work to become a low cost carrier  we launched a business process improvement bpi effort and implemented an organizational design initiative to examine all aspects of our operations for potential cost savings 
the goal is to achieve greater efficiency by streamlining or eliminating processes  outsourcing processes where appropriate  reducing levels of management and generally reducing the employee complement as warranted 
we met our target savings of in our expense run rate in these savings will be used to increase new and renewal commissions to independent agents to improve our competitive position and to make investments in technology 
associated with these expense reduction steps and our real estate consolidation actions  we incurred in pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges in we are targeting additional expense savings of to in in conjunction with our goal to achieve greater efficiency  we revised our real estate strategy 
this strategy involves a migration to leased office space from owned facilities 
in  we ceased the previously planned expansion of our headquarters in the university district of seattle  washington 
we completed the sale of our redmond  washington office campus  completed the sale of our headquarters in the university district of seattle  washington and entered into leases for our corporate headquarters and northwest regional office in downtown seattle  washington 
we believe that this strategy  which will reduce our overall cost of ownership and occupancy  will provide us with greater flexibility in the use of our capital and allow us to be more agile in adopting business process and technology changes prospectively 
we recognized in that the growth trends in our business were unfavorable  and we made a commitment to reverse the slide in our policies in force 
we re engaged our independent agency force by meeting with agents across the country  listening to their feedback  which provided us with a foundation to improve our relationship with our agents 
we developed action plans based on this feedback  including agent compensation structure changes  product enhancements and service improvements 
managing our capital effectively during  we repurchased million shares  or of our then outstanding common stock  at a total cost of  primarily under stock buyback programs 
we also repurchased in principal amount of our debt for including transaction costs 
during  we repurchased million shares  or  of our then outstanding common stock at a total cost of  primarily under stock buyback programs 
we also repurchased in principal amount of our debt for  including transaction costs 
in  we used the majority of the  proceeds from the sale of life investments l i to return our debt to capital ratios to pre sale levels and return excess capital to our shareholders 
specifically  we used  including transaction costs  to repurchase of debt  and we used to execute an accelerated stock buyback program of million shares 
we retained the balance of the sale proceeds for future flexibility and to pay transaction related expenses 
investing to modernize and standardize our technology in  we evaluated our technology infrastructure and developed a five year roadmap to replace obsolete technology 
we improved our critical systems availability to almost  in support of our automated underwriting 
we also completed our major developments on our safeco now platform  including umbrella and our next generation of auto and small business products 
we have piloted a virtual worker program for claims and underwriting to be implemented in 
table of contents overall results our vision is to be the indispensable choice for customers and agents through excellence in the solutions we provide  the ease of doing business with us and the competitiveness of our products 
we aim to achieve industry leading profitable growth  build a sustainable competitive advantage  and create long term shareholder value 
we measure our success by tracking our operating and financial performance according to the following indicators combined ratio earnings per share return on equity revenue  premium and policy growth in addition  we track our operating performance with various productivity and efficiency measures  we report periodically on a subset of productivity measures  such as policies in force per full time equivalent employee pif per fte 
the following table shows the trends in these key measures year ended december  combined ratio net income per diluted share net return on equity total revenues pif per fte segment results how we report our results in  we made revisions to our segments  which are intended to be more reflective of how these segments are managed 
our asbestos and environmental results  previously included in sbi regular and sbi special accounts facility  are in p c other 
in addition  due to the sale of safeco financial institution solutions sfis  our lender placed property insurance business  these results previously included in sbi special accounts facility are in p c other 
prior periods have been restated to reflect the revised presentation 
we manage our businesses in four business and seven reportable segments safeco personal insurance spi auto property specialty safeco business insurance sbi sbi regular sbi special accounts facility surety p c other in addition to the activities of these reportable segments  we report certain transactions  such as the interest expense we pay on our debt  debt repurchases  miscellaneous corporate investment income  intercompany eliminations  real estate holdings  contributions to safeco insurance foundation the foundation and other corporate activities in our corporate segment and do not allocate these to individual reportable segments 
due to the sale of our l i businesses in  all results related to l i are included in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents how we measure our results we look at three measures to assess the results of our business segments premiums underwriting profit or loss combined ratio written premiums are premiums charged for policies issued 
we view net written premiums as a measure of business production for the period under review and a leading indicator of net earned premiums 
we include insurance premiums in revenues as they are earned over the terms of the policies 
underwriting profit or loss is our net earned premiums less our losses from claims  loss adjustment expenses lae and underwriting expenses 
combined ratio is our losses  lae and underwriting expenses divided by our net earned premiums 
we report combined ratio as a percentage 
for example  a combined ratio of means that for every dollar of premium earned  cents is spent on losses  lae and underwriting expenses  and cents is underwriting profit 
a lower combined ratio reflects better underwriting results than a higher combined ratio 
more information about our segment results can be found in our p c operating results on page investment activities are an important part of our business 
we don t include our investment portfolio results when measuring the profitability of our individual segments because we manage them separately 
we invest the insurance premiums we receive in a diversified portfolio until needed to pay claims 
our first priority is to meet our promise to our policyholders that we will maintain resources to pay their claims 
we invest in a diversified portfolio of primarily high grade fixed maturities 
this strategy is designed to provide protection for our policyholders and a steady income for our shareholders 
our investment philosophy is to emphasize after tax investment income  balanced with investment quality and risk provide for liquidity when needed reduce volatility in investment performance through prudent diversification we measure our investment results in two parts the after tax net investment income we earn on our invested assets  and the net realized investment gains or losses we recognize when we sell or impair investments 
it is our intent to hold a diversified portfolio so we will achieve consistent investment performance 
more information about our investment results can be found in our investment results on page application of critical accounting estimates we have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
the application of these accounting estimates requires us to use judgments involving assumptions and estimates about future results  trends or other developments that could significantly influence our results if actual experience differs from those assumptions and estimates 
we review these judgments frequently 
an understanding of them may help readers to better understand our consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis md a 
we consider our most critical accounting estimates to be loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reinsurance recoverables valuation of investments 
table of contents loss and loss adjustment expense reserves our loss reserves reflect our estimates of the ultimate amounts to be paid for losses arising from both reported and unreported claims and our loss adjustment expense lae reserves reflect our estimates for claim settlement expenses related to those losses including legal expenses and other costs that we have not yet paid to settle both reported and unreported claims 
we report these amounts in our loss and lae reserves on our consolidated balance sheets 
we record two categories of loss and lae reserves case basis reserves and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
we estimate case basis reserves as the amount we will have to pay for losses that have already been reported to us but are not yet fully paid 
these amounts include related legal expenses and other costs associated with resolving and settling a particular claim 
we establish ibnr reserves at the end of every reporting period to estimate the amount we will have to pay for losses that have occurred  but have not yet been reported to us losses that have been reported to us that may ultimately be paid out differently than expected in our case basis reserves losses that have been paid and closed  but may reopen and require future payment expenses related to resolving and settling these losses we use actuarial methods combined with judgment to estimate ibnr reserves 
process and methodology for establishing loss and lae reserves the process for establishing loss and lae reserves differs for case basis versus ibnr reserves 
case basis reserves for reported losses  we establish a reserve estimate for each claim based on the known facts regarding the claim and the parameters of the coverage that our policy provides 
case basis reserves are adjusted as additional facts become available to us 
case basis reserves are reduced as we make payments for our reported claims 
ibnr reserves to establish our ibnr reserves  we use different approaches for current accident year losses prior accident years losses allocated loss adjustment expenses alae unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae these approaches exclude exceptional loss activity associated with catastrophic weather losses  non catastrophe weather losses and other large loss or salvage the amount we recover from property that becomes ours after we pay for a total loss  and subrogation our right to recover payments from third parties 
the methodologies used to establish ibnr reserves differ for the current accident year the year in which a claim occurs versus prior accident years 
the methodologies also differ for long tailed lines of business versus short tailed lines of business 
generally speaking  short tailed lines of business are those lines where the vast majority of claims from a particular accident year are both reported and settled within two years 
current accident year losses for short tailed lines of business  we use a ratio of ibnr reserves to earned premiums 
under this approach  an ibnr percentage is applied to current period earned premiums resulting in current period ibnr reserves 
for long tailed lines of business  we use an annual expected loss ratio approach 
under this approach  an expected loss ratio is applied to current period earned premiums resulting in an estimate of ultimate losses 
the resulting estimate of ultimate losses is reduced by the current period paid and case basis reserve activity  resulting in the current period ibnr reserves 
expected loss ratios and ibnr to earned premiums percentages are developed based on our analysis of prior accident years supplemented with data about changes in our book of business  changes in the external environment in which we operate  
table of contents changes in our pricing and underwriting  and changes in our claims handling practices 
we review these ratios throughout the year  and we revise the expected loss ratio and ibnr percentage periodically based on these analyses 
changes in the selection of the expected loss ratio or ibnr percentage result in changes in the loss reserve estimate for the current year  which we report in current period earnings 
prior accident years losses for short tailed lines of business  beginning ibnr reserves for prior accident years may be adjusted for expected paid and case activity  as well as explicit adjustments beyond this activity 
for long tailed lines of business  the beginning ibnr reserves for prior accident years may be adjusted for actual paid and case activity  as well as explicit adjustments beyond this activity 
allocated loss adjustment expenses alae alae reserves represent an estimate of the claims settlement expenses that can be identified to a specific claim 
alae reserve estimates are generally established as a function of losses 
for some small lines  estimates of ultimate alae are established as a percentage of earned premiums 
these alae factors are established based on historical ratios supplemented for changes in our internal and external environments 
alae ibnr reserves are determined by subtracting paid and case basis activity from the ultimate alae estimate 
unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae ulae reserves represent an estimate of the claims settlement expenses that cannot be identified to a specific claim 
ulae reserves are booked in aggregate for current and prior accident years combined 
in general  prior reserves are carried forward and supplemented with either a percentage of earned premiums or with a fixed dollar amount of additional reserves to account for growth in the line of business 
estimating loss and lae reserves estimating loss and lae reserves is a complex process because the ultimate losses are uncertain 
some claims will be paid out over a number of years  and there may be a significant lag between the time a loss occurs and the time it is reported to us 
we make significant judgments and assumptions about many internal variables and external factors 
examples of internal variables include changes in our claims handling practices changes in our business mix examples of external factors include trends in loss costs economic inflation judicial changes legislative changes regulatory changes these variables and factors affect the amounts we are ultimately required to pay for losses and related expenses 
as a result  it is not always possible to quantify their final impact on our future payments 
our process for arriving at our estimate of ultimate loss and lae is based on actuarial analysis and judgment 
it involves reviewing actuarial assumptions  holding discussions with claims and underwriting management  and considering changes in the internal and external environment 
because estimating reserves requires us to use assumptions and judgment  our actual future losses may differ from our estimates 
some actuarial techniques rely on our past loss and lae experience to estimate our future payments 
the changes we ve made in our business in recent years  however  also affect our future payments 
for instance  we have introduced new products  tightened our underwriting criteria and improved our claims handling practices 
as a result  we also consider these changes when estimating future payments 

table of contents for most of our lines of business  we use multiple estimation methods that vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated to establish our estimate of ultimate losses 
our estimate of ibnr reserves is the difference between our projection of ultimate losses and the payments we have made and case basis reserves we have established for those losses 
our analyses are applied to historical claim activity and experience  supplemented with data about changes in our book of business  changes in the external environment in which we operate  changes in our pricing and underwriting policies  and changes in our claims handling practices 
the standard actuarial methods we use include paid loss development historical payment patterns for prior claims are used to estimate future payment patterns for current claims 
these patterns are applied to current payments by accident year to yield expected ultimate losses 
incurred loss development historical case incurred patterns paid losses plus case basis reserves for past claims are used to estimate future case incurred patterns for current claims 
these patterns are applied to current case incurred by accident year to yield expected ultimate losses 
average claim value and claim count development loss payment and or case incurred amounts are divided by the number of claims to generate average costs per claim 
using historical patterns  the expected ultimate average cost per claim by accident year is projected 
separately  the expected ultimate number of claims is projected by accident year 
the product of the expected ultimate average cost per claim and the expected ultimate number of claims yields expected ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio loss ratios are developed for recent accident years based on historical accident year loss ratios  adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current rate levels 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is then applied to the actual earned premiums to calculate expected ultimate losses 
bornhuetter ferguson this approach blends the expected loss ratio method with either the paid or incurred loss development method 
both methods are used with weights applied to each of them based on the maturity of the accident year 
as an example  if the current accident year for personal automobile bodily injury is estimated to be paid  then the paid loss development method would receive a weight of  and the expected loss ratio method would receive a weight 
we use many of the above methods to estimate reserves for each product line 
the merits of each method are evaluated given the facts at hand 
an estimate of the ultimate losses is then made based on the particular method or combination of methods deemed most appropriate 
for example  if a particular line has been subject to significant changes in claims handling practices that would impact the comparability of case basis reserves between periods  we would give little or no credibility to the incurred loss development approach 
there is uncertainty in our estimates of ultimate losses 
this uncertainty can stem from such factors as irregular claim reporting and payment patterns and changes in our mix of business 
we consider this uncertainty by looking at historical claim patterns by line of business and by examining our historical reserve accuracy 
for each line  we consider expected volatility when estimating and recording reserves 
the various assumptions  estimates and other factors that may have an impact on our ultimate losses are discussed with management to determine our best estimate of ultimate losses and lae  and our estimate of ibnr reserves is then recorded 
we use range analyses only as a retrospective view to test whether previously established estimates for reserves for our lines of business are reasonable  using subsequent information 
our estimate of our ultimate loss and lae reserves is subject to change as additional data emerge 
this could occur as a result of the emergence of exceptional loss activity an actuarial study the emergence of internal variables or external factors that would alter our view 
table of contents in general  we review our reserves quarterly 
this review includes either an actuarial analysis involving the application of standard actuarial techniques or the review of the paid and incurred activity in the quarter relative to the assumptions from our previous actuarial analyses 
in addition  special studies are undertaken periodically for certain lines of business or exposures 
we segregate the activities of estimating losses for product pricing purposes from those of determining reserves to be reported in our financial statements 
management has the ultimate responsibility for the determination of appropriate reserves  based on recommendations from the appointed actuary 
estimating our loss and lae reserves is an ongoing process 
our loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate future payments associated with losses and related expenses  giving consideration to the uncertainties inherent in the estimates 
we record any adjustments to these reserves in the periods in which we change the estimates 
we report changes to these reserves in our consolidated statements of income 
catastrophe loss reserves are established by event by the claims department when the event occurs 
these estimates are revised as the actual loss experience develops and claims are reported and settled over time 
we reduce our reserves by the amounts we expect to recover from salvage and subrogation 
we accrue salvage and subrogation recoveries on an individual case basis for large claims 
we use actuarial techniques to estimate the amount for small claims 
we may determine that certain loss or salvage subrogation activity is beyond the scope of what was anticipated in the initial establishment of loss reserves 
in that case  we would adjust ibnr reserves to directly reflect this activity 
other considerations we do not discount any of our reserves to present value 
we purchase reinsurance to limit our exposure to potential large losses 
we report the amounts we expect to recover from reinsurers as reinsurance recoverable assets on our consolidated balance sheets

table of contents loss and lae reserve variability loss and lae reserves are subject to variability  particularly the ibnr component 
for the lines of business we write  variability in the frequency the average number of claims filed  or severity the average cost of a claim is generally a function of one or more of the following factors payout period lines of business involving claims that stay open for long periods are subject to greater reserve variability 
this is driven by the difficulty in estimating future economic  social and legal trends that impact both the time that such claims remain open and their future costs 
size of the reserve balance slight variations in large reserve balances can generate significant financial volatility 
policy limits lines of business involving policies with high or unlimited policy limits are subject to greater variation 
policy deductibles lines of business involving excess policies with large deductibles  or policies that provide coverage for claims that exceed the policy limit of an underlying policy  are subject to greater variability 
the existence of large policy deductibles considerably increases the lag between the occurrence of a claim and the time it is reported to us 
safeco personal insurance spi spi loss and lae reserves generally are estimated using standard actuarial methods and judgment 
these methods involve analyzing past claims experience for recent changes in business claims practices and the internal and external environments 
emphasis is placed on evaluating claims reporting and closing patterns  as well as the size of loss payments and case basis reserves 
spi losses and related expenses are analyzed by line of business  product  coverage and geographic area 
auto policies provide coverage for bodily injury  uninsured motorists  personal injury protection  medical payments  property damage  and comprehensive and collision losses 
in arriving at our estimates  we consider our changing mix of business we write more policies in standard and non standard markets where we have not written significant business previously 
these risks have  on average  higher frequencies and lower severities than preferred risks 
our change in new business new business generally has higher claim frequencies than business that has been on the books for longer than one year 
general inflation and medical cost trends 
bodily injury bi coverage represents the largest portion of our loss and alae reserves held for auto 
small variations from our assumptions can yield significant financial volatility given the magnitude of these reserve balances 
to illustrate the sensitivity of our estimate  a one point increase in our severity assumption for auto bi would yield an increase of approximately in the estimated reserve 
our property and specialty lines are predominantly short tailed business  and most claims are reported and settled within months 
we use standard actuarial techniques and judgment to estimate reserves for those lines 
charges to our reserve estimates for property and specialty generally result from frequency or severity differences from historical patterns or development on catastrophe related losses  which can be difficult to estimate due to the associated widespread damage

our p c other segment has exposure to asbestos and environmental losses primarily from policies we no longer write 
our sbi segment has exposure to construction defect losses and related expenses through the general liability  commercial multi peril and umbrella coverages it provides 
these exposures and the risks they present are discussed in aggregate for sbi and p c other as they are estimated by product and like exposure

the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end year ended december  loss and alae payments reserves at year end  before reinsurance earned premiums claims number of claims reported claims in the year open claims at year end factors in estimating loss reserves for workers compensation estimating reserves for workers compensation involves a significant degree of uncertainty and judgment 
this is driven by long payout periods workers compensation claims can remain open years or more  introducing variability in the ultimate length of the payout 
the cumulative effect of inflation trends over time  particularly medical cost inflation  can be significant 
unlimited liability nature of workers compensation policies many claims can pay out for the lifetime of the claimant with no limit on the total payment amount 
changes in future benefit levels legislative actions and judicial interpretations can affect the cost of future benefits 
increases in life expectancy increases in life expectancy increase both the duration of future payments and the ultimate cost of treatment 
claim reporting lags some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to workers compensation losses arising from policies written in prior years 
changes in our business changes in our claims handling practices  changes in our writings of large versus small to mid sized accounts  and changes in the mix of states where these policies are written can affect our ability to predict ultimate payout based on historical data 

table of contents in determining our best estimate for workers compensation reserves  long term medical cost inflation trends over the average claim payout period represent our most significant assumption 
we have assumed that double digit medical cost inflation will continue in the near term  moderating over time to historical levels 
our best estimate of workers compensation reserves presents risk of unfavorable reserve development should medical inflation trends not abate 
a one point increase in our estimate of the average medical cost severity trend would yield an increase of approximately in our estimated reserves 
other commercial products excluding commercial liability products  which are discussed below  the payout periods for our other commercial products  primarily commercial auto and commercial property  are relatively short 
as a result  our estimated loss reserves for these products are subject to less volatility than our workers compensation reserves 
we use standard actuarial techniques combined with judgment to estimate these loss reserves 
commercial liability products our commercial multi peril policies  business owners policies  general liability and commercial umbrella policies provide third party liability coverage to our policyholders 
estimating reserves for third party liability involves a significant degree of uncertainty and judgment 
this is driven by long payout periods many third party liability claims are paid years after the occurrence of the loss 
as a result  the cumulative effect of inflation can be significant 
claim reporting lags some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to losses arising from policies written years ago 
changes in coverage interpretation legislative actions and judicial interpretations can affect the cost of future payments 
changes in our business changes in our claims handling practices  changes in our writings of large versus small to mid sized accounts  and changes in the mix of types of business can affect our ability to predict ultimate payout based on historical data 
these factors give rise to latent claim emergence and evolving coverage precedents for claims regarding such things as asbestos  environmental and construction defects 
we discuss each of these claim types in further detail below 
construction defects this table shows our loss and alae reserves for construction defects claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end year ended december  loss and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
our construction defects claims exposure our exposure to construction defects claims comes from general liability and commercial multi peril coverages we provide to contractors 
construction defects claims result from alleged defective work performed in the construction of large structures that include apartments  condominiums and large developments of single family dwellings or other housing 
construction defects claimants often seek payment for damages resulting directly from the alleged defective construction work and diminished economic value of the structure meaning that the structure has less market value because of the alleged defective construction work 
construction defects claims are complex  with an inherent difficulty in determining 
table of contents fault 
most of our claims are concentrated in a small number of states  particularly california 
our ibnr reserves were of our loss and alae reserves for construction defects claims at december  and of our loss and alae reserves for construction defects claims at december  we have taken a number of actions to mitigate our exposure to construction defects claims  enabling us to vigorously defend our coverage position 
they include stricter underwriting standards a separate claims handling function and internal legal counsel specializing in construction defects claims relationships with external legal counsel specializing in construction defects claims estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims the main factors driving the uncertainty and judgment in estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims are changing legal and regulatory environments statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing these claims diminished value claims involvement of multiple plaintiffs  defendants and insurers long periods between the actual construction work and the date the claim is reported the uncertainty created by these factors requires more judgment in estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims than for our other lines of business 
we use techniques developed specifically for estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims 
with these techniques  we estimate the number of future claims and the average value of every claim and make adjustments for anticipated changes in coverage interpretations  regulations  judicial rulings  plaintiff attorney involvement and changes in our book of business 
over the last three years  the number of open construction defects claims has decreased steadily an average drop of per year 
our loss reserve estimates assume that the number of open claims will continue to decrease  but at a slower rate 
asbestos this table shows our loss and alae reserves for asbestos related claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end year ended december  loss and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
in this table  the three year survival ratio represents the number of years our current loss reserves would last if future payments were made at the same average annual rate experienced over the last three years 
the three year survival ratio is equal to our loss reserves  divided by our average annual payment over the last three years 

table of contents due to volatility and the sparseness of data  estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more than standard actuarial techniques 
as a result  we analyze and consider claims statistics and trends  directional trends in survival ratios  and applicable law and coverage litigation 
our asbestos liability exposure here s the breakout of our asbestos loss reserves  net of reinsurance relates to our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and our exposure to syndicates and pools 
relates to our direct exposure 
accordingly  we have two separate special claims handling functions  one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our runoff assumed reinsurance operations  and one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our direct exposure 
our exposure through our runoff assumed reinsurance operations is primarily excess of loss reinsurance 
pools are groups of insurers that enter into agreements to share exposure related to specific insureds 
our loss reserve estimates for pools reflect the loss reserve estimates provided by the pools independent actuaries 
the loss experience of our runoff assumed reinsurance operations follows the general industry trend 
our direct exposure is primarily due to smaller and more peripheral entities becoming defendants in asbestos claims 
our exposure to the major high profile asbestos defendants is limited for our direct business 
this stems from our historical business strategy to not write direct coverages for larger companies 
in addition  we do not have direct exposure to businesses that are the subject of settlement agreements 
our ibnr reserves were of our loss and alae reserves for asbestos claims at december  and of our loss and alae reserves from asbestos claims at december  this table provides details about our policyholders and losses paid related to asbestos loss reserves year ended december  net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves direct loss alae ibnr loss and alae assumed loss alae ibnr loss and alae total loss alae ibnr loss and alae total number of policyholders 
table of contents estimating loss reserves for asbestos estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more judgment than our other lines of business 
that s primarily because past claim experience may not be representative of future claims 
several factors make it difficult to predict future asbestos claim payments 
they include insufficient data inherent risk of major litigation diverging legal interpretations regulatory actions legislative actions increases in bankruptcy proceedings non impaired claimants being allowed to make claims efforts by insureds to seek coverage interpretation not subject to aggregate limits changes in these factors could result in future asbestos claims payments that are significantly different from those currently predicted 
in estimating our loss reserves for asbestos claims  we consider applicable law and coverage litigation analyze claim statistics and trends review industry information to test the reasonableness of our reserves do not consider ongoing congressional reform efforts some asbestos related claims are subject to non product liability coverage rather than product liability coverage 
non product liability coverage may not be subject to policy aggregate limits  resulting in higher asbestos claims payments and related expenses 
environmental this table shows our loss and alae reserves for our liability coverages related to environmental claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end year ended december  loss and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
our environmental claims exposure our environmental claims result from our assumed reinsurance operations that are in runoff status and from our commercial general liability line that we write on a direct basis 
we generally have avoided writing coverages for large companies with substantial exposures to environmental claims 
as a result  our average environmental claim tends to be small 
our ibnr reserves were of our loss and alae reserves for environmental claims at december  and of our loss and alae reserves for environmental claims at december  
table of contents our relatively limited environmental claims activity results in fluctuations in average values from period to period 
the average paid closed environmental claim increased compared with due to a lag between our payments and ceded recoveries we expect to receive in the average paid closed environmental claim increased compared with due in part to a general liability settlement relating to contaminated land on a single private development project 
additionally  average payments were unusually low in due to the above mentioned settlement reached on a large number of individual environmental claims related to coverage on general liability policies written for individual gasoline stations 
estimating loss reserves for environmental claims the volatility of actuarial estimates of liabilities for environmental claims is often greater than that of other exposures 
this is due to several factors including insufficient data changes in the number and types of defendants involved with these claims unresolved legal issues  including existence of coverage  definition of ultimate damages and final allocation of damages due from the financially responsible parties in light of these factors  we estimate loss reserves for environmental claims including consideration of claim statistics and trends directional trends in survival ratios applicable law and coverage litigation industry data surety our surety bonds insure construction performance  as well as legal matters that include appeals  probate cases and bankruptcies 
by their nature  surety claims result in lower loss frequency and higher loss severity than most of our p c products 
in addition  surety claims provide us with substantial opportunity for salvage and subrogation  the nature and extent of which vary from case to case 
to estimate loss reserves for surety  we examine actuarial analysis large claim analysis reinsurance terms and conditions individual insured exposure analysis analysis of salvage and subrogation potential our surety loss and alae reserves  net of salvage and subrogation recoveries  were at december  and at december  surety reserves fluctuate from period to period due to the lag between the time payments are made on a claim and the time we receive salvage and subrogation amounts

for example as shown in section a  our loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  after years  we ve actually paid  section c shows our revised loss and lae reserve estimates through the years 
for example as shown in section a  our reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  section c shows the annual reestimation of those reserves  and after years our revised reserves were  section d shows the cumulative redundancy or deficiency developed through the years 
a redundancy occurs when our reserves exceed our actual loss experience  and a deficiency occurs when our reserves are less than our actual experience 
for example as shown in section a  our loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  after one year those reserves developed a redundancy  and after years these reserves developed a deficiency 
this is the difference between the reserves shown in section a net of reinsurance  and the reestimated amounts in section c 
our analysis of losses and lae reserve development table shows these trends unfavorable development in reserve estimates from through favorable development in reserve estimates from through 
table of contents the unfavorable trend from through was primarily due to significant increases in workers compensation medical costs legislative and regulatory developments higher than expected number of construction defects  religious institution allegations  asbestos and environmental losses the favorable development from through was primarily due to lower than expected number of claims in our auto and property segments lower than expected number of claims in commercial auto and liability lower than expected number of claims in construction defects in the analysis of losses and lae reserve development table  all amounts include the effects of changes in amounts for prior periods 
conditions and trends that affected our loss and lae reserves in the past may not occur in the future 
for example  substantial reduction in our large commercial insurance and program business in will disproportionately affect trends in these tables for several years 
as a result  our analysis of losses and lae reserve development table is not a basis for estimating future redundancies or deficiencies

table of contents reinsurance recoverables on page  we provided an overview of how we use reinsurance 
here  we focus on how we estimate reinsurance recoverables 
the reinsurance we buy limits our losses on certain individual risks and reduces our exposure to catastrophic events 
we purchase reinsurance from several reinsurers and are not dependent upon any single reinsurer 
reinsurance recoverables are the amounts our reinsurers owe us related to the losses we have incurred 
we reported at december  and at december  in reinsurance recoverables as assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in our reinsurance recoverables in is a result of recoverables from hurricane katrina losses in and estimated reinsurance recoveries related to workers compensation 
determining reinsurance recoverables requires us to make estimates because we do not know the exact amount due from the reinsurer until all our underlying losses are settled 
the amount of reinsurance recoverables varies depending on the size of individual losses and the aggregate amount of losses in particular lines of business 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables  we review estimates of large losses that are covered under reinsurance agreements review reinsurance recoverable amounts for specific claims as well as for lines of business compare our estimates with past reinsurance recoverables perform actuarial analyses of loss development above and below our retention levels the amounts we absorb before the reinsurers reimburse us specified under our reinsurance agreements examine actuarial data with and without reinsurance recoverables estimating an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables we regularly review our reinsurance recoverables to determine the collectibility of what is owed to us 
in doing that  we review historical collection experience reinsurance recoverables associated with individual reinsurers  including large exposures and those with lower rated reinsurers reinsurance recoverables concentrated with a particular event or issue for example  a large loss  a catastrophe or an emerging claim issue trends in default rates by credit rating our estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was at december  and at december  valuation of investments our investments include fixed maturities and marketable equity securities  which we report at fair value as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fixed maturities we invest in include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
the marketable equity securities we invest in include common stock and non redeemable preferred stock 

table of contents how we determine other than temporary declines in the value of our investments we regularly review the fair value of our investments 
invested assets are subject to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
periodic changes in fair values of our investments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until we sell the security or when declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
if the fair value of any of our investments falls below our cost or amortized cost basis in the investment  we analyze the decrease to determine whether it is an other than temporary decline in value 
to make this determination for each security  we consider how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its amortized cost the current financial condition and future prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings potential our intent and ability to keep the security long enough for it to recover its value any downgrades of the security by a rating agency any reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments based on our analysis  we make a judgment as to whether the decline is other than temporary 
sometimes  an investment decline we consider temporary in one quarter can become other than temporary in a future quarter 
if the decline is other than temporary  we report an impairment charge within net realized investment gains in our consolidated statements of income in the period we make that determination 
we reported impairment charges of in compared with in and in determining the fair value of our investments for the majority of our investments  we use available public market price information to determine the fair value 
when such information is not available  as is the case for securities that are not publicly traded  we use other valuation techniques 
these techniques include using independent pricing sources  including brokers evaluating discounted cash flows identifying comparable securities with quoted market prices based on industry sector  credit quality and maturity using internally prepared valuations based on certain modeling and pricing methods more about our investments can be found in the our investment results section on page

auto and sbi regular premiums have decreased in the face of increased competitive pressures  as some of our competitors have increased advertising for auto insurance to attract customers  offered incentives to agents and lowered prices to attract new auto and commercial business 
despite increasing competitive pressures  we remain disciplined in our underwriting and continue to adhere to our long term profitability targets 
in addition  in  net earned premiums decreased by due to the second quarter sale of our lender placed property insurance business 
in  our growth slowed in the face of increased competitive pressures as some of our competitors increased advertising for auto insurance and lowered prices to attract new auto and commercial business 
net investment income our net investment income increased in compared with  and increased in compared with the increase in compared with was due to slightly higher interest rates in the increase in net investment income in compared with was due to an increase in average invested assets  as a result of positive operating cash flows partially offset by lower yields on new investments compared with yields on matured or called investments 
net realized investment gains net realized investment gains decreased in compared with  and in compared with the decrease in compared with was due to losses on securities sold and increased impairments caused primarily by changes in fair value driven by interest rates on securities that we may not hold until they recover in value 
the net realized investment gains included a tax exempt gain of

catastrophe losses the decrease in losses and lae reflected lower catastrophe losses 
we categorize catastrophes as events resulting in losses greater than per event and involving multiple claims and policyholders 
catastrophes can be caused by natural events  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  wildfires  earthquakes and hailstorms  or other factors such as terrorism  riots  hazardous materials releases or utility outages 
pretax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  were in  compared with in and in catastrophe losses in were primarily from hurricanes katrina and rita along the gulf coast 
catastrophe losses in were primarily from four hurricanes in florida and surrounding states 
interest expense interest expense was in  in and in the increase in  compared with was due to increased interest rates on the portion of our debt that is swapped to floating rates partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of our debt repurchases described below

however  using them to measure profitability while fairly common in our industry is not consistent with gaap 

table of contents our p c operating results the primary measures of our operating results include our premiums  underwriting profit or loss and combined ratios 
the following tables report those key items by our reportable segments for the last three years 
more information about the results also by reportable segment follows the tables 
premiums are the primary driver of our revenues  along with net investment income and net realized investment gains 
net written premiums are a non gaap measure representing the amount of premium charged for policies issued with effective dates during the period 
premiums are reflected as revenue in the consolidated statements of income as they are earned over the underlying policy period 
net written premiums applicable to the unexpired term of a policy are recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated balance sheets 
we view net written premiums as a measure of business production for the period under review and a leading indicator of net earned premiums

these underwriting tiers are further refined using multivariate models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors and provide a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
our new personal auto policy  now available in of the states where we write business  is designed to give our customers a more personalized product 
we plan to reach additional customers with the new safeco optimum package  which policyholders can purchase as an endorsement to their personal auto policy 
with the package  customers can boost the value of their insurance  be rewarded for good driving and receive extra protection for emergencies and theft 
underwriting and pricing discipline in  we experienced continued competition within the auto segment as many insurers achieved strong underwriting results 
competitors increased marketing and advertising for new auto insurance customers 
we also have seen rate decreases by competitors in some states  loosening of underwriting standards and use of unsupported new business discounting 
we will maintain our underwriting discipline and not compete for business that we cannot obtain at our long term target margins 
ease of doing business we are committed to enhancing the ease of doing business for our agents through further development of our safeco now automated underwriting platform  which lowers our agents costs and provides an easy to use  web based sales and service platform 
we streamlined our enrollment and renewal processes further in by accessing information on prior insurance carriers and accessing motor vehicle reports automatically 
we also enhanced our safeco now platform to streamline the service process by building functionality so auto policy changes and endorsements can be processed online 
these endorsements include vehicle additions and deletions  vehicle replacements or updates  coverage and deductible charges 
we increased our points of distribution by appointing approximately  new agents in compensation structure we carefully monitor our rates and offer our agents choices in the area of compensation so they can match compensation to their business model

overall  we received approval for average rate increases of in  decreases of in and increases of in premium trend was negative in  resulting from a change in our mix of business to lower average premium policies 
this is primarily due to a reduced premium base of non standard policies or drivers who represent relatively higher risks 
premiums also are affected by the increased pricing for those policies that insure newer and more expensive cars  as well as by changes in the risk profile of the book of business  which we refer to as premium trend

these factors  net of reinsurance  decreased our combined ratio by points in compared with our loss costs increased in compared with this was partly due to the effect of our increased average deductible  which has eliminated some low severity losses that are not reported because they are less than the now higher deductible amounts

we anticipate the following factors will impact our growth and profitability in the near future competitive environment we expect the competition within the auto segment to continue through the use of mass market advertising  agent and broker compensation and promotional pricing 
we will maintain our underwriting discipline and not compete for business that we do not believe will meet our long term target margins 
while adhering to our discipline  we will seek ways to grow profitably during this competitive cycle 
we carefully monitor our rates and our compensation  and make changes to each when actuarially supported by our total business and justified by our economics

underwriting segmentation our segmented auto product offers up to underwriting tiers using multivariate models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors  providing a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
going forward  we expect to refine our underwriting and pricing models to increase precision in matching rate for each risk and to enable us to quote a broader range of risks within the states where we do business 
in  we will introduce a liability component to our optimum package  providing further enhancements and choices 
business growth as we seek to grow our business  we will continue to write the entire spectrum of auto risks  from preferred through non standard  though our strength in the near term is preferred risks with its longer tenured customers 
we will continually strive to make our rates more competitive by driving cost and inefficiency out of the product 
we also will focus on the changing nature of the independent distribution channel through new agency appointments and customized business approaches 
we will continue to study the purchasing behaviors of insurance consumers to design products that reflect changing demographics

this allows us to offer policies to a wider range of small businesses

table of contents impact of terrorism the terrorism risk insurance extension act of triea extends the requirement of insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to certain commercial policyholders  including workers compensation policyholders 
under the extension  triea now excludes automobile  burglary and theft  surety  professional liability and farm owners multi peril insurance 
although triea excludes professional liability insurance from the commercial policies required to offer terrorism coverage  it explicitly retains directors and officers liability insurance 
us government funding under triea  the us government will provide funding to the insurance industry if a terrorist attack is certified as such by the secretary of the treasury in concurrence with the secretary of state and attorney general of the united states 
the criteria for certification include the act is dangerous to human life  property or infrastructure  and is committed by an individual or individuals on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest 
the extension adds a program trigger 
under this new provision  insurers will not be compensated unless the aggregate industry insured losses from a certified act of terrorism  occurring in  exceed subject to the program trigger  the us government s share is of the certified losses in excess of individual insurance company deductibles in program year 
triea determines the deductibles for insurance companies as a percentage of their direct earned premiums 
our estimated deductible for is terrorism exclusions prior to the enactment of triea  our policies excluded losses due to foreign terrorism in states that had approved the exclusions 
for triea covered policies  we do not exclude losses due to foreign terrorism unless the policyholder rejects our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage 
the insurance services office iso created coverage and pricing tools to help insurers respond to the triea requirements 
if the policyholder does reject our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage  we can then exclude coverage for losses due to foreign terrorism 
the iso has filed exclusions for acts of terrorism as defined by triea  and we have adopted those filings 
however  some states limit the use of terrorism exclusions 
reinsurance options the availability of terrorism reinsurance is limited in the commercial reinsurance market 
our current reinsurance program provides limited terrorism coverage 
all reinsurance treaties exclude certified terrorist acts and also non certified terrorist acts involving nuclear  chemical  biological or radioactive materials 
treaties providing both certified and non certified terrorist acts include our workers compensation reinsurance program and our commercial umbrella reinsurance program 
our property catastrophe treaty provides non certified terrorism coverage for of above the first of loss 
our exposure is modest we believe our exposure to potential terrorism losses is relatively modest across all our product lines 
with commercial insurance  our focus is on small to mid sized businesses generally not viewed as likely potential terrorism targets 
similarly  with workers compensation policies  the number of employees covered is a key consideration 
we decline to provide coverage in cases where we believe the exposure to terrorism is potentially greater 
with our personal lines of insurance  we believe that losses due to terrorism would be relatively modest 
we believe that exposure and risk to individuals are small

based on state limits in place at the end of  our insurance subsidiaries can pay us up to in aggregate dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
we do not expect these regulatory restrictions to have any impact on our ability to meet our obligations

share repurchases on november   our board of directors increased the number of shares available for purchase under our share repurchase program to million shares 
we repurchase shares under rule b trading plans  open market purchases and accelerated share repurchase programs 
a b trading plan allows us to repurchase our shares during periods when we would normally not be active in the market because of our own internal trading windows 
through accelerated share repurchase programs  we return excess capital to shareholders and immediately reduce the number of our common shares outstanding 
the dealer obtains the shares that we repurchase by borrowing them on the open market and then purchases shares in the market over time to repay the borrowed shares

on november   we repurchased million shares  or  of our then outstanding common stock through an accelerated share repurchase asr program 
the shares were purchased from a dealer at per share  for a total cost of at the end of the asr program  we may receive or be required to pay a price adjustment to the dealer based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the period of the asr purchases 
we have elected for this price adjustment to be settled in shares 
if settled at december   the price adjustment would have been or  shares 
we anticipate the asr program will be completed by the end of april on november   we declared a regular dividend of per share on our common stock 
the dividend was payable january  to shareholders on record on january  our bank credit facility on march   we executed a five year revolving credit facility  which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the terms of the bank credit facility which runs through march require us to pay a fee to have these funds available maintain a specified minimum level of shareholders equity keep our debt to capitalization ratio below a specified maximum the bank credit facility does not require us to maintain any deposits as compensating balances 
at the end of and throughout  we had no borrowings under the bank credit facility and we were in compliance with all its covenants 

table of contents our contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were payment by total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest real estate operating leases pension and other retirement obligations other commitments purchase obligations subtotal loss and lae reserves total loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claims and related settlement costs 
because of the nature of insurance policies  there is typically no minimum contractual commitment associated with covered claims 
both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates  and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain 
therefore  the ultimate amount and timing of loss and lae payments could differ significantly from our estimates 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
financial strength ratings financial strength ratings provide a benchmark for comparing insurers 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial strength and a stronger ability to pay claims

table of contents factors that determine financial strength ratings in determining financial strength ratings  the rating agencies focus on results of operations capital resources debt to capital ratio management expertise marketing investment operations minimum policyholders surplus requirements capital sufficiency to meet projected growth access to capital impact of financial strength ratings lower financial strength ratings could materially and adversely affect our company and its performance and could increase the number of customers who terminate their policies decrease new sales increase our borrowing costs limit our access to capital restrict our ability to compete legal and regulatory considerations the florida legislature  in a special session in january  enacted wide ranging legislation in an attempt to mandate lower prices for property insurance in the state 
the actual impact of the new law on our business is still unknown  as there are unresolved regulatory and legal issues 
for example  the following are issues still subject to regulatory action determination of the mandatory rating factor intended to reflect a lower reinsurance cost related to expansion of the state run florida hurricane catastrophe fund and the requirement that companies writing private passenger auto in florida also write homeowners insurance there if they write it elsewhere in the united states 
we write commercial insurance policies and personal auto policies in florida 
in  we sought permission to discontinue our personal property business in the state  and we are complying with the regulator s order dictating the terms of that run off 
dividend payments from our subsidiaries our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to safeco corporation 
we then use that money to pay dividends to our shareholders as well as to make principal and interest payments on our debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay safeco corporation 
exceeding such limits would require prior regulatory approval 
in total in  our insurance subsidiaries can pay up to in dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
these amounts are according to the limits states had in place at the end of risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state regulators use risk based capital rbc formulae to identify companies that are undercapitalized and that may merit further regulatory attention or action 
our insurance subsidiaries have more than sufficient capital to meet rbc requirements 
income taxes at december   we had of gross deferred income tax assets 
gross deferred income tax assets are composed of temporary differences created as a result of amounts deductible for taxes in future periods 
such temporary differences relate primarily to unrealized gains on investments and differences in the recognition of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  deferred policy acquisition costs  goodwill and unearned premiums 
although realization of deferred income tax assets is not assured  we believe they will be realized through future earnings  including but not limited to the generation of future operating income  reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we 
table of contents have not recorded a valuation allowance for these assets 
more information on income taxes can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation number fin with an immaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements 
pension plans our pension obligations assets resulting from the defined benefit pension plan we sponsor covering substantially all employees are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
more information can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded for our pension obligation and pension cost are affected by assumptions used to calculate them  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
to calculate our benefit obligation  as of december   we used a discount rate assumption of based on consideration of the general interest rate environment  the calculation of an equivalent discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed maturities with future cash flows that are similar to the timing and amount of our estimated future pension benefit payments and other relevant factors 
to calculate pension cost for the year ended december   we used a discount rate assumption of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of and a compensation increase of compounded annually 
we determined the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption by considering the mix of investments within the plan  the expected future investment performance of those asset sectors  actual investment experience during the lifetime of our plan and other relevant factors 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would result in an increase of in pension cost in a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would result in an increase of in pension cost in new accounting standards a discussion of new accounting standards can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments this table shows the fair values of certain of our financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and to analyze the sensitivity of our financial instruments to changes in interest rates and equity prices  we show in the second column in the table for each year the effect a basis point increase in market interest rates would have on the fair values 
in the third column for each year we show the effect a decline in equity prices would have on fair values december  fair value increase decrease in asset or liability fair value increase decrease in asset or liability change in interest rates change in equity prices change in interest rates change in equity prices financial assets fixed maturities marketable equity securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate swaps financial liabilities notes due notes due notes due notes due debentures due interest rate swaps market risk is our potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates and equity prices 
in addition to market risk  we are exposed to other risks  including credit risk related to our investments underlying insurance risk related to our core businesses the sensitivity analysis used for the table summarizes only the market risk related to our recorded financial assets and liabilities 
we seek to maintain a laddered maturity portfolio of fixed income investments with reasonable average durations 
we keep sufficient cash and short term investments to provide for the liquidity needs of the operating companies 
in our fixed income allocation  we try to maximize after tax income without sacrificing investment quality or assuming too much interest rate and call risks 
in our equity portfolio  we invest in a diversified group of high quality companies providing us with portfolio diversification  capital appreciation and dividend income 
we calculate the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates by using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling  where appropriate 
the adjusted market rates assume a basis point  simultaneous  parallel increase in market interest rates 
assuming million shares outstanding  if there was a basis point increase in interest rates  our book value per share of would decline by per share  or 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed above 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in this sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited because it does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis excludes certain non financial instruments such as insurance liabilities 
accordingly  any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts or adjusted fair value amounts does not equal the underlying fair value of net equity
