risk factors 
overview as used herein  the terms we  us  our or the company refer to biomed realty trust  inc  a maryland corporation  and any of our subsidiaries  including biomed realty  lp  a maryland limited partnership our operating partnership  and industrial road  lp industrial road or our predecessor 
we operate as a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit focused on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
our tenants primarily include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  scientific research institutions  government agencies and other entities involved in the life science industry 
our properties are generally located in markets with well established reputations as centers for scientific research  including boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania and new york new jersey 
we were formed on april  and completed our initial public offering on august  from inception through august   neither the company nor our operating partnership had any operations 
industrial road was the largest of the properties contributed in our initial public offering and therefore has been identified as the accounting acquirer pursuant to paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
as such  the historical financial statements presented herein for industrial road were prepared on a stand alone basis up to and including the acquisition date  august  upon completion of our initial public offering  the interest in the predecessor acquired from affiliates was recorded at historic cost 
the acquisitions of the unaffiliated interests in the predecessor and the interests in all of the other properties have been accounted for as a purchase in accordance with sfas on may   we completed the acquisition of shady grove road  human genome sciences  inc s  square foot headquarters office and laboratory facility  and belward campus drive  its  square foot large scale manufacturing facility  as well as undeveloped land that we estimate can support the development of up to approximately  rentable square feet of laboratory and office space  located in rockville  maryland for approximately million  excluding closing costs 
the properties are fully leased to human genome sciences pursuant to year triple net leases 
on june   we completed a follow on common stock offering of  shares at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on june   we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility  doubling the size of the facility from million to million 
in addition to increasing the size of the facility  the amendment extended the term to june   provided greater flexibility with respect to covenants  and reduced the borrowing rate 
we may extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to june  and may increase the amount of the facility to million upon satisfying certain conditions 
on july   we completed the acquisition of the pacific research center located at gateway boulevard  newark  california 
the property  consisting of ten two and three story office buildings totaling  square feet  as well as undeveloped land that we estimate can support the development of up to approximately  rentable square feet of space  was acquired for approximately million  excluding closing costs 
on august   we completed a follow on common stock offering of  shares at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 

table of contents on august   we closed a million fixed rate  mortgage loan with keybank national association  which is secured by our shady grove road property in rockville  maryland 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and matures on september  on september   the lead underwriter of our initial public offering exercised a warrant to purchase  common shares at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on september   our operating partnership issued million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on november   we completed the acquisition of the center for life science boston located in boston  massachusetts 
the property consists of one eighteen story office building currently under construction that will total  square feet of retail  office and laboratory space when completed 
the property was pre leased to four tenants upon acquisition  with an average lease term of years 
the total purchase price of approximately million  excluding closing costs  was financed through borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and a million secured construction loan with keybank and other lenders 
we expect to invest in excess of an additional million in the center for life science boston to complete the project 
on december   we signed a new  year lease with regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc for approximately  square feet of to be built office and laboratory space at our landmark at eastview property 
under the lease  regeneron will relocate a majority of its existing operations at the landmark at eastview property to buildings to be constructed by us on the landmark campus 
following regeneron s relocation  which is expected to occur in march  we intend to redevelop and offer for lease the space regeneron currently occupies at the landmark at eastview property excluding  square feet of space that regeneron will continue to lease 
in addition to the acquisition of the properties in rockville  maryland  newark  california  and boston  massachusetts  during  we acquired twelve properties totaling approximately  rentable square feet of laboratory and office space that was leased at acquisition for an aggregate of approximately million excluding closing costs 
from our initial public offering through december   we have declared aggregate dividends on our common stock and distributions on our operating partnership units of per common share and unit  representing four full quarterly dividends of  five full quarterly dividends of  and a partial third quarter dividend of per common share and unit 
as of december   we owned or had interests in properties  located principally in boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania and new york new jersey  consisting of buildings with approximately million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space  which was approximately leased to tenants excluding space currently available for redevelopment 
of the approximately million square feet of unleased space  million square feet  or of our unleased square footage  was available for redevelopment 
in addition  we have properties with approximately million rentable square feet under construction and undeveloped land that we estimate can support up to an additional million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space 
factors which may influence future operations our corporate strategy is to continue to focus on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
as of december   excluding space available for redevelopment  our property portfolio was leased to tenants 
leases representing approximately of our rentable square footage expires during and approximately of our rentable square footage expires during our leasing strategy for focuses on leasing currently vacant space and negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the year  and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space to occupy the spaces for which we are unable to negotiate such renewals 
additionally  we will seek to lease space that is currently under a master lease arrangement at our king of prussia property  which expires in the master lease at our bayshore boulevard property expired in february the property was subsequently leased 
table of contents to two tenants with an average lease term of approximately six years 
we also intend to proceed with other new developments  when real estate market conditions permit 
in november  we acquired the center for life science boston  a  square foot life science research building under development 
we expect to invest in excess of an additional million to complete the project 
in addition  we have commenced approximately  square feet of development at our landmark at eastview property in new york  and approximately  square feet of development at our fairview avenue property in seattle  washington 
the success of our leasing and development strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and life science industry trends in the united states and in our target markets of boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania  new york new jersey and research parks near or adjacent to universities 
we believe that  on a portfolio basis  rental rates on leases expiring in and are at or below market rental rates that are currently being achieved in our markets 
however  we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be released at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates or at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they address the most material parts of our financial statements  require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code to our operations and financial results and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to qualify  and continue to qualify  as a reit 
however  it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit  or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax and  in most of the states  state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
even as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes 
if we lose our reit status  then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved  and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years ground lease term of the related lease tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease acquired management agreements non cancelable term of the related agreement purchase accounting was applied  on a pro rata basis where appropriate  to the assets and liabilities of real estate entities in which we acquired an interest or a partial interest 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  buildings  and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
we determine the as if vacant fair value using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
in allocating fair value to the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place leases are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between a the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and b our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases at acquisition  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of acquired in place leases and acquired management agreements  are recorded based on a variety of components including  but not necessarily limited to a the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases ie the market cost to execute a lease  including leasing commissions and legal fees  if any  b the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period ie real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  c the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period  and d the value associated with avoided tenant improvement costs or other inducements to secure a tenant lease 
the fair value assigned to the acquired management agreements are recorded at the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the management agreements acquired of the acquired management agreements with certain tenants of the acquired properties 
the values of in place leases and management agreements are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable period of the respective leases or agreements 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts related to that lease would be written off 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development  construction  improvements and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  
table of contents construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs  and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
capitalized costs associated with unsuccessful acquisitions are charged to expense when an acquisition is abandoned 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacement and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 
we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate  we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
as of and through december   no assets have been identified as impaired and no such impairment losses have been recognized 
revenue recognition we commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors 
in most cases  revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
generally  this occurs on the lease commencement date 
in determining what constitutes the leased asset  we evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements 
if we are the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements  then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space  typically when the improvements are substantially complete 
if we conclude we are not the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements the lessee is the owner  then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives which reduces revenue recognized over the term of the lease 
in these circumstances  we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct improvements 
the determination of who is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins 
we consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes 
these factors include whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  
table of contents whether the tenant or landlord retain legal title to the improvements  the uniqueness of the improvements  the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease  the responsible party for construction cost overruns  and who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements 
the determination of who owns the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination we consider all of the above factors 
however  no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accrued straight line rents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
substantially all rental operations expenses  consisting of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs are recoverable from tenants under the terms of our lease agreements  but are dependent on several factors  including occupancy and lease terms 
tenant recovery revenue is recognized in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues tax force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
eitf requires that these reimbursements be recorded gross  as the company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the credit risk 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
a gain on early termination of a lease of million is included in other income in the consolidated statement of income and was due to the early termination of a portion of the nektar lease at our industrial road property 
accordingly  the related deferred lease commissions and remaining other related intangible assets have been fully amortized 
we will recognize a gain in of approximately million related to the early termination of the novartis lease at our elliott property 
the funds were received prior to december   and have been recorded as a deferred gain within other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the corresponding gain is deferred until as it did not meet revenue recognition criteria in due to the execution of the termination agreement on january  however  certain intangible assets related to the novartis lease have been fully amortized as of december  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent and tenant recovery payments or defaults 
we may also maintain an allowance for accrued straight line rents and amounts due from lease terminations based on our assessment of the collectibility of the balance 
payments received under master lease agreements entered into with the sellers of the bayshore ended february and king of prussia properties to lease space that was not producing rent at the time of the acquisition are recorded as a reduction to buildings and improvements rather than as rental income in accordance with eitf  recognition of receipts from made up rental shortfalls 
investments in partnerships investments in partnerships are consolidated if a controlling interest is held using the guidance provided in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  and accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb 

table of contents fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or vies and the determination of which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
generally  fin r applies when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
eitf states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
if the criteria in eitf are met  the consolidation of existing limited liability companies and partnerships accounted for under the equity method may be required 
except for investments consolidated in accordance with fin or eitf  we account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity in the investment is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and our share of net income or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in partnerships may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
management does not believe that the carrying values of any of our investments in partnerships are impaired as of december  results of operations the following is a comparison  for the years ended december  and and for the years ended december  and  of the consolidated operating results of biomed realty trust  inc  the operating results of industrial road  lp  our predecessor  and the combined operating results of bernardo center drive  science center drive and balboa avenue 
we refer to bernardo center drive  science center drive and balboa avenue as the combined contribution properties 
as part of our formation transactions  our predecessor was contributed to us in exchange for  units in our operating partnership  and the combined contribution properties  which were under common management with our predecessor  were contributed to us in exchange for  units in our operating partnership 
our predecessor is considered for accounting purposes to be our acquirer 
as such  the historical financial statements presented herein for our predecessor were prepared on a stand alone basis 
the financial statements of the combined contribution properties are presented herein on an historical combined basis 
management does not consider the financial condition and operating results of our predecessor on a stand alone basis to be indicative of the historical operating results of our company taken as a whole 
therefore  the following discussion relates to the combined historical financial condition and operating results of our predecessor and the combined contribution properties  over which our management has provided continuous common management throughout the applicable reporting periods 
subsequent to the dates they were contributed to us  the financial information for each of our predecessor and the combined contribution properties is included in the financial information for biomed realty trust  which commenced operations on august  management believes this presentation provides a more meaningful discussion of the financial condition and operating results of biomed realty trust  our predecessor and the combined contribution properties 
in order to present these results on a meaningful combined basis  the

general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in employees resulting in increased personnel and infrastructure costs 
the year ended december  included a  increase to general and administrative expense resulting from a correction of the expensing of restricted stock grants awarded to our executive officers and other employees at the time of our initial public offering in august that occurred in the periods prior to the year ended december  we do not believe that the correction to this expensing of restricted stock grants is material to the first and second quarters of or to our consolidated financial statements
