table of contents technology systems we leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers needs 
a key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient  flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies and the development of new and diversified products

we believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs  improve quality and provide faster  more flexible technology services 
consequently  we continuously review capabilities and develop or obtain systems  processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements 
as part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies  we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality  lower cost  or both 
over time  we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure 
consistent with this approach  in august capital one and total system services inc tsys finalized a five year definitive agreement for tsys to provide processing services for capital one s north american portfolio of consumer and small business credit card accounts

funding and liquidity a discussion of our funding programs and liquidity has been included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding on pages competition as a marketer of credit card  consumer and commercial financial products and services  we face intense competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
some of these companies are substantially larger and have more resources than we do 
our industry has experienced substantial consolidation and may continue to do so  this consolidation continues to create competitors who are larger and have more resources than we do 
in addition  such consolidated and or larger competitors may have a more diversified product and customer base  operational efficiencies and more versatile technology platforms than we do 
consolidation has and may continue to increase competitive pressures on both us and other companies in our industry 
each of our financial products is marketed to specific consumer populations across the credit spectrum 
the terms of each product are actively managed to achieve a balance between risk and expected performance 
for example  credit card product terms typically include the ability to reprice individual accounts upwards or downwards based on the customer s payment and other performance 
in addition  since  we have marketed low non introductory rate cards to consumers with low risk and established credit profiles to take advantage of the favorable risk return characteristics of this consumer type 
industry competitors have continuously solicited our customers with these and other interest rate strategies 
management believes the competition has put  and will continue to put  additional pressure on our pricing and general product feature strategies 
we compete with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards  as well as with american express  discover card and  to a certain extent  smart cards and debit cards 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features  and customer loyalty is often limited
