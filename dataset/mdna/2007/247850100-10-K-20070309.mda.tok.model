item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  primarily in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
in addition to its timber and lumber operations  the company is engaged in real estate development in central arkansas 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages the company s timberlands  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of softwood lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  accounting  information systems  human resources  purchasing  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the company s timberlands consist primarily of southern pine  known in the industry as a type of softwood 
deltic considers its timberlands to be the company s most valuable asset and the harvest of stumpage to be its most significant source of income  accordingly  deltic actively manages its timberlands to increase productivity and maximize the long term value of these timber assets 
the company harvests timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans and sells such timber in the domestic market or converts it to lumber in its sawmills 
stumpage supplied to the company s sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market 
the company implemented a timberland acquisition program in late  and this ongoing program has enabled the company  when desired  to increase harvest levels  while expanding its timber inventory 
thus far  the company has focused its acquisition program on timberland in its current operating area 
the company s two sawmills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency  reduce labor costs  maximize utilization of the timber resource  and maintain high standards for production quality with safety being one of the highest priorities 
in addition  each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the company s timberlands 
the mills produce a variety of lumber products  including dimension lumber  boards  timbers  decking  and secondary manufacturing products  such as finger jointed studs 
these lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors  lumber treaters  and truss manufacturers in the south and mid western united states and are used mainly in residential construction  roof trusses  and laminated beams 
the company s real estate operations were started in to maximize the value of former timberland strategically located in the growth corridor of west little rock  arkansas 
since that time  the company has been developing chenal valley  a premier planned community consisting of  acres of residential and commercial properties 
the property is being developed in stages  and real estate sales to date have consisted primarily of residential lots  which are sold to builders or individuals  and commercial sites 
in addition to chenal valley  deltic has developed chenal downs  a acre development located just outside chenal valley  and red oak ridge  an acre development in hot springs  arkansas 
also  the company disclosed in plans for the ridges at nowlin creek  an upscale   acre  residential development located just west of chenal valley  that features state of the art best management practices to protect water quality in response to its site adjacent to lake maumelle 
for additional discussion  see the ridges at nowlin creek in the executive overview section 

table of contents the del tin fiber plant is located near el dorado  arkansas 
construction of the plant was completed  and initial production began in the plant is designed to have a rated annual production capacity of million square feet mmsf on a inch basis of mdf  making it one of the largest plants of its type in the world 
mdf  which is used primarily in the furniture  flooring  and molding industries  is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips  shavings  and sawdust  pressed and held together by an adhesive bond 
executive overview deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment  with a major diversification in real estate development 
this environment is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates  imports  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw material  and weather conditions 
given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no influence over the market s pricing levels for its wood products 
accordingly  the company will continually seek to reduce controllable costs and expenses from its manufacturing processes 
sales of real estate are affected by general economic conditions and interest rates  specifically as such factors are manifested in the company s operating area of central arkansas 
significant accomplishments during the year of include the company s real estate segment had sales of almost acres of commercial real estate properties  including the sale of approximately acres to an affiliate of red development  llc for the development of the promenade at chenal  an upscale lifestyle shopping center  deltic s woodlands segment maintained pine sawtimber price at levels despite downward pressure from a weakened lumber market  the company s percent interest in del tin fiber  llc had a record return in  and deltic leased natural gas drilling rights for approximately  net mineral acres in an area of arkansas known as the fayetteville shale play  bringing the total amount leased to approximately  net mineral acres  and deltic essentially completed installation of major capital upgrades at both sawmills in order to improve operating efficiencies and reduce unit manufacturing cost  which contributed to its mills segment generating positive cash flow in despite depressed average sales realizations 
the woodlands segment continued its trend of steady contributions to earnings during the current year 
the pine sawtimber harvest volume of  tons was virtually unchanged when compared to s volume of  tons 
the segment s operating income was also essentially unchanged from the company accelerated the pine sawtimber harvest by ten percent during the first half of to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
with housing starts down and the resulting impact of mill curtailments during the last half of  deltic expects average pine sawtimber prices to decline slightly in while lumber production levels within a region can influence pine sawtimber prices  lumber prices typically do not 
over the long term  there is a fundamental correlation between the level of lumber prices and pine sawtimber prices 
however  in the short term  the geographical size differential between the lumber and pine sawtimber markets results in the two acting somewhat independently of each other 
pine sawtimber markets operate primarily within local or regional areas with sales being mainly to sawmills 
these mills are subject to a relatively fixed level of demand for raw materials that is driven by the facilities required production levels 
increases in pricing levels within the lumber market typically do not have a significant effect on the existing demand for raw materials in the short term  resulting in little impact to pine sawtimber prices 
this trend would typically also be true in the short term during times of a depressed lumber market 
ultimately  the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be dependent upon the size or existence of markets for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
the company continues to manage the harvest level of its forests on a sustainable yield basis 

table of contents deltic has increased the return requirements for the sale of higher and better use and non strategic timberland  and accordingly  the company has reduced timberland sales activity 
timberland designated as higher and better use consists of tracts with market values that exceed the land s worth as a timber growing platform 
deltic s approximately  acre timberland holdings in the expanding westward growth corridor of little rock  arkansas  is an example of such land 
non strategic timberland is composed primarily of tracts too small to allow efficient timber management  those geographically isolated from other company fee lands  and acreage otherwise not deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
the ancillary values of land ownership  such as revenues from hunting leases  mineral lease bonuses and royalties  and land easements  have historically provided additional income to deltic s woodlands segment 
recent advances in technology and increased pricing levels have resulted in the economic viability of expanded natural gas exploration within the state of arkansas 
one current area of activity  known as the fayetteville shale play  is an unconventional natural gas reservoir  ranging in depth from  feet to  feet  and is spread across multiple arkansas counties 
during and  deltic leased approximately  and  net mineral acres  respectively  in this area to various exploration enterprises and received applicable lease bonus payments and the possibility of future royalty income should production be established 
the company continues to evaluate additional leasing requests within the fayetteville shale play  although future leasing will probably not be significant 
the ultimate benefit to deltic from these mineral leases remains speculative and unknown to the company and is contingent on the successful extraction and sale of natural gas from the area 
for the mills segment  the status of the lumber market and the resulting impact on the company s commodity softwood lumber products will continuously impact operating strategies and financial results 
us housing starts for reached their second highest level on record  exceeded only by during the second half of and the first part of  the federal reserve steadily increased the federal funds rate in an effort to gradually slow economic growth and hold inflation in check 
these increases  as well as other inflationary factors  significantly slowed housing starts in consequently  the high demand and pricing levels for softwood lumber products experienced during and declined to year lows for some dimensions during the segment s average lumber sales price declined percent when compared to as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future 
many factors can affect deltic s average lumber sales prices in most industry analysts are projecting a weaker housing market to continue into due to record level housing inventories in and increased financing costs 
other factors impacting future lumber prices include the extent of industry curtailments and the potential for decreased imports due to the resolution of the softwood lumber trade dispute between the us and canada 
the company will also be impacted by the level of repair and remodeling activity 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth  after inflation  deltic has concentrated management s attention  in regard to its manufacturing operations  on improving sales realizations through product and customer mix enhancements and improving production efficiencies and the cost structure at its lumber mills 
the company is anticipating improved efficiencies at the ola mill after it has completed the final step of a capital upgrade program 
management believes this upgrade will help the mill s future operations by maximizing hourly production levels with the smaller log size available as raw material for this mill 
deltic s mills segment reported a decrease in volumes of finished lumber production and sales for the year of the decrease in lumber production was primarily due to the elimination of an operating shift at the ola mill in response to decreased demand and pricing 
sales activity levels for the company s real estate developments are affected by economic conditions that influence the level of housing starts in the central arkansas region  including general economic conditions and interest rates 
the effect of rising mortgage interest rates in decreased the overall demand for residential lots in chenal valley  the largest of the company s three active developments  as evidenced by chenal valley s residential lot closings in this was a reduction of lots from s level of residential lot closings 
the reduction of commitments from area builders which was noted in the last half of continued into as a result  the company developed lots in and currently does not plan to offer any new lots in ultimately  the impact to deltic s overall real estate business model from moderate fluctuations in the annual volumes of residential lot sales is deemed minimal in light of the company s 
table of contents continued focus on the long term financial returns from the ultimate build out of the chenal valley development 
in deltic s other two active developments  red oak ridge had sales of lots and chenal downs had sales of four lots 
the company s red oak ridge real estate development in hot springs  arkansas  experienced a record level of activity and residential lot sales in deltic has developed lots in red oak ridge and in chenal downs uncommitted as of year end while chenal downs is fully developed  deltic plans to develop additional lots within red oak ridge subsequent to actual future annual lot development levels will be dependent upon the demand for the company s residential lots 
the real estate segment s average sales price for residential lots sold in was  which was an increase of percent when compared to  due to the current year sales mix including a smaller percentage of lower priced lots as increased interest rates in more significantly impacted potential lot buyers in this market segment 
deltic s lot development plans provide for a mix of lot offerings that represent all real estate market segments for a planned community 
neighborhoods adjoining chenal country club s second hole  championship golf course designed by robert trent jones  jr 
represent the highest priced market segment in the chenal valley development 
average prices for non golf course lots are lower and vary between neighborhoods depending on other factors such as lot size and location 
the mix of lot offerings for any given year will be driven by lot inventory and expected demand 
during  the company disclosed plans for a  acre  lot  upscale residential development  the ridges at nowlin creek  on a portion of its land holdings located within the highway growth corridor west of chenal valley 
a portion of the development is located within the watershed of lake maumelle  a principal source of drinking water for little rock 
due to this environmentally sensitive locale  the company s plans include best management practices using the most modern and proven methods to create a low impact development in order to protect water quality in the lake 
the local water utility commissioned the preparation of a watershed management plan  which it subsequently adopted 
this plan is largely compatible with the company s low impact development plans 
however  shortly after commissioning preparation of its new watershed management plan in  the utility filed a petition in the circuit court of pulaski county arkansas  to condemn that portion of the development within the lake s watershed  and deposited its estimate of just compensation for the land taken 
the condemned property includes all of lots  parts of an additional planned lots  and proposed access to seven planned lots as well as approximately acres not within the development 
deltic initiated proceedings to have a jury determine the true amount of just compensation for the taking of the lands  as well as other damages 
the trial regarding the just compensation for the property subject to the condemnation was scheduled to begin in march on march   the board of commissioners for central arkansas water authorized the utility to settle its condemnation action against the company 
the company will need to further assess the viability of proceeding with development of lots in the remaining acreage 
for further discussion  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
commercial real estate sales activity is by nature less predictable than residential activity 
with the number of residents in chenal valley and other west little rock areas growing steadily  and momentum created from previous sales of commercial acreage in the development  interest in the company s remaining commercial acreage is increasing 
the volume of commercial sales totaled acres in versus acres in however  the average sales price per acre decreased significantly from  for to  for the commercial real estate sold in provided a higher than normal average sales price per acre due to the sale of a prime location at a key intersection  while the average sales price per acre returned to a more normal range in future pricing trends for commercial real estate sales are difficult to predict and are influenced by multiple factors  which include intended use of the site  motivation of the purchaser  and property location and access 
no commercial acreage is included in the chenal downs development or the planned development of the ridges at nowlin creek 
red oak ridge includes a small amount of commercial property  depending on actual final land usages 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases 

table of contents operating results for del tin fiber are affected primarily by the overall mdf market and plant operating performance 
the largest market segment for mdf is furniture 
however  this segment has continued to shrink as chinese imports continue to take us market share 
the end of brought about higher than normal demand for the season  allowing the industry to enter with lower inventory and poised for improved pricing 
the market remained strong until the fourth quarter and brought about record prices for del tin fiber 
the current growth markets in mdf are thin panels used primarily for store fixtures and flooring 
del tin fiber concentrated in these segments during the year and successfully changed the product mix to a high percentage and more profitable mix of thinner products 
the fourth quarter brought a much slower market  and entering  the forecast for mdf does not show growth in sales 
operationally  del tin fiber continued to make significant advances during the plant s management team remained focused on raising the plant s uptime percentage and achieved a record high 
the percentage of premium grade products continued to climb during the plant had record profits during as a result of higher prices in the industry and the shift to thinner products 
during the fourth quarter  raw material prices rose by percent caused by severe shortages of resin and wood products 
this trend is expected to continue during future efforts are being concentrated on further improving productivity levels and plant efficiencies and making additional reductions in the plant s manufacturing cost per thousand square feet msf 
significant events on april   red development llc announced that it planned to purchase from deltic a site within chenal valley for the promenade at chenal  an upscale lifestyle shopping center 
after extensive efforts by both parties  the sale of acres of commercial property was closed on september  the development of the promenade at chenal is strategic to chenal valley in that it is expected to further increase interest in the company s additional acres of commercially zoned property adjacent to the site 
on september   the company completed an agreement with suntrust bank and other banks an unsecured and committed revolving credit facility totaling million 
the facility also contains a million letter of credit feature 
the agreement  which will expire on september   replaced the existing facility that was scheduled to expire july  the funds available through this agreement will enable deltic to take full advantage of value adding growth opportunities as they present themselves 
on august   del tin fiber successfully refinanced its existing long term debt by entering into a credit agreement consisting of a letter of credit and term loan with multiple lending institutions pursuant to which  million of its million industrial revenue bonds were redeemed 
under the new credit agreement  the lenders  on september   loaned del tin fiber million  which will be repayable over five years in equal quarterly installments  that began on december   and issued on del tin fiber s behalf  a letter of credit in the amount of million to support the remaining industrial revenue bonds originally issued in by union county  arkansas 
this refinancing resulted in more favorable credit terms for the joint venture 
the most notable was the removal of the remaining required bond sinking fund payments of million due in under the prior debt facility 
for additional information about the company s investment in del tin fiber  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
from the time production began at del tin fiber in until the fourth quarter of  both operating and financial performance were below the expectations established at the time that the decision to construct the plant was made 
as a result  on april   deltic announced that banc one capital markets  inc had been retained as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the company s investment in del tin fiber 
subsequently  deltic s management and board of directors completed its review of these strategic alternatives and announced the company intended to exit the mdf business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
as a result of this decision  the company s evaluation of possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture was based primarily upon the estimated cash flows from a possible sale of the company s interest during and resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december  the investment was written off  to zero  and the write off amounted to million before income taxes 

table of contents due to the company s commitment to fund its share of any of the facility s operating working capital needs until the facility was able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or deltic s ownership was sold  the company recognized equity in del tin fiber equal to the extent of these advances during for the year of  such advances approximated the company s equity share of losses for the plant  accordingly  the investment in del tin fiber at december  was zero 
the company also continued to utilize its management resources to work with del tin s management and the joint venture partner to improve operating performance at the plant 
as a result of these improvements  on december   deltic s board of directors revised its intent regarding the company s investment in del tin fiber and ceased efforts to sell the company s interest in the joint venture  while continuing to focus on improving operating and financial results of the plant 
due to this decision  the evaluation of fair value for the investment was based primarily upon the future net cash flows from del tin fiber s operations over the remaining life of the plant 
in  the company began recording its equity share of the operating results of the joint venture

table of contents other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  contractual guarantees of debt  and letters of credit at december   were million  million  and 
million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million and contractual guarantees of debt of 
million  while the fair value of the company s letters of credit would be unchanged 
fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
there was no impact for resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates on the estimated pretax earnings and cash flows  holding other variables constant 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars

critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified seven of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  six of these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
with the exception of the reduction of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  deltic has not made any material changes to its critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s four development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  red oak ridge  and the currently suspended the ridges at nowlin creek are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf course at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent professional engineering consultants 
independent appraisers are utilized to provide the potential market value for unsold acreage 
investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is adjusted for the company s proportionate share of del tin fiber s undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as applicable under the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture 
the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related 
table of contents investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value  which was zero as of december   and the company resumed recording its equity share of the operating results of del tin fiber 
likewise  cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the company s investment in the facility  while cash distributions received from the joint venture are reflected as reductions in its investment 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners  the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value  and the estimate of the fair value of the company s guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
in evaluating the possibility of the existence of an impairment for the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber under apb  management must estimate future net cash flows from the possible courses of action available for its investment  such as continuing to maintain or sell its investment  to determine both recoverability of the carrying amount and fair value of the investment 
more specifically  management must determine the possible courses of action and estimate the probability of each potential action  as well as the related future net cash flows 
then  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  management must determine if this impairment is other than temporary 
if so  then an impairment write down is required 
in estimating the fair value of the guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement  deltic s management must first assess how the same debt instrument would have been structured without the guarantees of the joint venture partners  in order to estimate the benefit resulting from deltic s guarantee 
a range of probabilities of estimated future cash outflows under the benefit previously determined are then assembled 
a probability weighted present value of the estimated future cash outflows is then calculated 
the resulting balance represents the fair value of the obligation  which is the estimate of the value of assets required currently to settle the liability in the future

timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company s professional foresters estimate its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized 
fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been 
million more in  
million more in  and 
million more in 
million  
million  and 
million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the 
table of contents company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the recognized cost of fee timber harvested is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management also evaluates any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate an impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations

table of contents deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the company s total stockholder return compared to the total return of a paper and forest products index the index selected by the compensation committee and calculated by standard and poor s 
determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgement  including forecasting future financial results 
this estimate is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change

income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities  based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the key management decisions related to income taxes are the determination of current taxability of transactions  the election to capitalize or expense costs incurred  the decision regarding the appropriate depreciation method for income tax purposes these three factors ultimately affect the company s cash flows for income taxes paid and determine the 
table of contents differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and management s estimation of the appropriateness of valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets that exist
