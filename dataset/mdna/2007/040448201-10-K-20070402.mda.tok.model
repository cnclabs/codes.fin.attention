deferred income taxes at december   the consolidated balance sheet contains a net deferred tax asset of approximately million related primarily to nols 
the realizability of this asset is dependent upon the company s generation of sufficient levels of future taxable income and the ability to retain its federal net operating tax loss carryforward position 
as of december   the company had nols of approximately million 
based upon projected future operating results  the nols of million are expected to be fully utilized to offset future federal taxable income in at december   approximately million of nols expired unused 
events may limit the use of all or a portion of these federal net operating tax loss carryforwards  thus potentially resulting in a higher tax liability for the company in the future 
the net deferred tax asset at december  is subject to future adjustment based upon changes in management s evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
goodwill is deemed impaired if the estimated discounted cash flows or earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
the company evaluated its goodwill at december  and  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
defined benefit plans the company accounts for the benefits under its defined benefit pension plan using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads individual events over the service lives of the employees in the plan 
examples of events are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and  therefore  the statement of earnings effects of pension benefits are earned in  and should be expensed in  the same pattern 
in calculating the net periodic benefit cost and the related benefit obligation  the company is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate assumptions reflect the prevailing market rates for long term  high quality  fixed income debt instruments that  if the obligation was settled at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due 
the company uses long term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  as well as future estimates of long term investment returns  to develop its assumptions of the expected return on plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is based on historical experience and the company s long term plans for such increases 
in  the company increased its pension liability liability by million relating to the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan as required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
in each of and  a basis point decline in the discount rate assumptions caused a decrease in the funded status of the company s pension plan 
no change in the discount rate assumption was made in consequently  the accumulated benefit obligation of the company s pension plan exceeded the fair market value of the plan assets at december  and as required by sfas  the company recorded a minimum pension liability and recognized related non cash  after tax  net charges of 
million and 
million to the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive earnings in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
these charges did not impact the company s pension expense  earnings or cash contribution requirements in or on december   the company froze the plan benefits for all hourly employees and certain salaried employees 
see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the company s defined benefit pension plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
as described below  credit risk  market risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of risk in the company s accounts receivable  investments and debt 
qualitative credit risk the company provides credit in the normal course of business to its customers  which are primarily educational institutions or distributors 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers  maintains allowances for potential credit losses and generally does not require collateral to support its accounts receivable balances 
market risk the company s exposure to market risk relates to the quality of holdings of its limited partnership investment 
the fair market value of the limited partnership s investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuers  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuers and from changes in general market conditions 
the company seeks to manage its exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with standards established by the investment committee of the board of directors 
the standards of the investment committee are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments  and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions and tax considerations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability and its ability to realize assets and satisfy liabilities 
interest rate risk is resident primarily in debt  which typically has variable interest rates based on prime or libor rates 
assuming no other change in financial structure  an increase of in the company s variable interest rate for debt would decrease pre tax earnings for by approximately 
million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of a increase in interest rates on the average debt estimated to be outstanding in quantitative the company s debt as of december  is as follows in millions  except percentage data maturity less than one year maturity greater than one year amount weighted average interest rate fair market value the fair market value of debt equals the face amount of debt outstanding because the underlying rate of interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable based upon prime or libor rates
