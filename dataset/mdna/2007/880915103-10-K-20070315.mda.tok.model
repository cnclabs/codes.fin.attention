item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
introduction terra industries inc terra or the company produces and markets nitrogen products for agricultural and industrial markets with production facilities located in north america and the united kingdom 
during december  the company acquired mississippi chemical corporation mcc 
as a result of the acquisition  the company owns a interest in point lisas nitrogen limited plnl  an ammonia production joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago 

table of contents during the fourth quarter  the company entered into a memorandum of understanding with kemira growhow oyj to create a joint venture to operate the fertilizer and associated process chemical businesses of both companies in the uk the memorandum of understanding is a non legally binding agreement and is subject to clearance from the uk competition authorities  negotiation of definitive documents and lender consent 
during the first quarter  the uk office of fair trading referred the proposed joint venture to the competition commission 
the company classifies its operations into two business segments nitrogen products and methanol 
the nitrogen products segment represents operations directly related to the wholesale sales of nitrogen products from its ammonia production and upgrading facilities 
the methanol segment represents wholesale sales of methanol produced by its methanol manufacturing plant 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen and methanol products 
during periods of significant increases in natural gas prices  the company may curtail or shut down its production facilities if finished goods prices do not allow the company to cover variable production costs 
the company s cost of natural gas increased to unprecedented levels in the third quarter due to supply disruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
during the second quarter  north american natural gas prices declined to pre hurricane prices 
nitrogen products are commodity chemicals that are sold at prices reflecting global supply and demand conditions 
imported nitrogen products  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed priced natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to our facilities 
off shore producers are most competitive in regions close to north american points of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast 
since some of the company s products compete with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  the company and other north american producers have not always been able to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this led to curtailments of north american nitrogen production in late and early during the nine month period ending september   the company s us and us manufacturing plants operated at approximately of capacity in response to slow demand and high natural gas costs 
much of the curtailed production was replaced with purchased product from other suppliers 
during the three month period ending december   the same plants operated at approximately of capacity as operations normalized in response to higher grain prices and stable natural gas costs 
during the second quarter  the company s ammonia plant at billingham  england incurred damage due to an explosion from a ruptured pipe 
the repairs were completed and ammonia production resumed during the third quarter 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
to be viable in this industry  a producer must be among the low cost suppliers in the markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
the company s nitrogen sales volumes depend primarily on its plants operations and imports from plnl 
the company may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  however  gross margins on those volumes have historically been insignificant 
profitability and cash flows from the company s nitrogen products business are affected by the company s ability to manage its costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting the company s nitrogen products results include the number 
table of contents of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during planting season  grain prices and other variables described in item business and item properties 
the company also produces methanol in the us similar to nitrogen products  methanol is a commodity chemical manufactured from natural gas 
consequently  natural gas costs and the supply demand balance for methanol significantly affect methanol earnings and cash flows 
a significant portion of us methanol demand is met by imports from regions with natural gas costs lower than those available to us producers 
in december  the company entered into contracts with the methanex corporation methanex assigning it the company s sales contracts and providing it exclusive rights to all methanol production at the beaumont facility for five years as more fully described in item business and item properties 
as permitted under these contracts  methanex elected to shut down the beaumont facility as of december  as long as the beaumont  texas facility remains idle through the december termination of the methanex contract  the company may realize revenues relating to the facility of up to million per year due to million from annual amortization of deferred revenues plus one half of the annual cash margin based on the plant s methanol production capacity  methanol reference prices and natural gas costs 
profit sharing cash margin during was million 
due to the high cost of natural gas  there was no cash margin realized during overview of consolidated results the company s revenues were billion  billion and billion during  and  respectively 
terra generated net income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
diluted income loss per share was  and in  and  respectively 
income from operations was million in  million in and million in the revenues decreased million from primarily as a result of lower uan and ammonium nitrate sales volumes  which were affected by lower overall fertilizer consumption during the planting season 
the operating income decreased million from due primarily to curtailed production rates during the first half of the first half operating rates averaged of plant capacity  which resulted in higher costs for purchased product and reduced plant efficiencies 
the revenues and cost of sales increased million and million from  primarily as a result of the acquisition of mississippi chemical company mcc in december natural gas prices increased in due to hurricanes katrina and rita  which also increased cost of sales 
the net income included a million charge related to early retirement of debt and a million gain in a change in fair value of warrants issued in connection with the mcc acquisition 
the net income included a million income tax benefits due to a favorable settlement with a foreign taxing authority 
the net income also included million attributable to an insurance recovery of product claim costs representing million of operating income less million of related income taxes and a million loss from the early retirement of long term debt representing million of losses less million of related income taxes 
factors that affect operating results factors that may affect the company s operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  industrial nitrogen and methanol  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of agriculture planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effect of general weather patterns on the timing and duration of field work for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and 
table of contents demand for the company s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs  and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products and methanol is natural gas 
natural gas purchases in and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total operating costs and expenses 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not hedged or recovered through an increase in the price of the company s nitrogen and methanol products would have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a portion of global nitrogen products and methanol production is at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  substantially lower priced than natural gas costs at the company s north american and uk facilities 
the company s facility at point lisas nitrogen limited  an unconsolidated subsidiary  is located in trinidad with access to such lower cost natural gas 
the company enters into forward pricing contracts for a portion of its natural gas requirements when such arrangements would not result in costs greater than expected north american and uk selling prices for the company s finished products 
the company s december  forward positions covered of the company s expected natural gas requirements excluding the natural gas requirements of point lisas nitrogen limited which purchases its gas under contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that determine food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions  international trade decisions and grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
weather can have a significant effect on demand for the company s nitrogen products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to the company s products 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could affect their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from the company s dealer customers 
the company s nitrogen business segment is seasonal  with the majority of nitrogen products consumed during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting activity 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which customers consume nitrogen products  the company and its customers generally build inventories during the second half of the year in order to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for the company s current level of sales  it maintains lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the company believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
methanol is used as a raw material in the production of formaldehyde  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  acetic acid and numerous other chemical derivatives 
the price of methanol is influenced by the supply and demand for each of these products 
environmental initiatives to ban or reduce the use of mtbe as a fuel additive  such as those currently underway in the united states  could affect demand for methanol 

table of contents the company s manufacturing operations may be subject to significant interruption if one or more of its facilities were to experience a major accident or were damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster 
the company currently maintains insurance  including business interruption insurance  which it believes is sufficient to allow it to recover from major damage to any of its facilities 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
management considers the accounting policies described below to be the company s most critical accounting policies because they are impacted significantly by estimates that management makes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management has discussed the development and selection of the company s critical accounting estimates  and the disclosure regarding them  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and do so on a regular basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
derivative and financial instruments the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including swaps  basis swaps and put and call options  to manage the effect of changes in natural gas costs  the prices of the company s nitrogen products and foreign currency risk 
management evaluates each derivative transaction and makes an election of whether to designate the derivative as a fair value or cash flow hedge or not to elect hedge designation for the derivative 
upon election of hedge designation  and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability or b reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period that the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges  or to the extent a hedge designated derivative is determined to be ineffective  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
until the company s derivatives settle  management tests the derivatives for ineffectiveness 
this includes assessing the correlation of nymex pricing  which is commonly used as an index in natural gas derivatives  to the natural gas pipelines pricing at the company s manufacturing facilities 
this assessment requires management judgment to determine the statistically and industry appropriate analysis of prior operating relationships between the nymex prices and the natural gas pipelines prices at the company s facilities 
to the extent possible  the company bases its market value calculations on third party data 
due to multiple types of settlement methods available  not all settlement methods for future period trades are available from third party sources 
in the event that a derivative is measured for fair value based on a settlement method that is not readily available  management estimates the fair value based on forward pricing information for similar types of settlement methods 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a transaction exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  no obligations remain and collectibility is probable 
revenue from sales is generally recognized upon shipment of product to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
as part of the revenue recognition process  the company determines whether collection of trade receivables are reasonably assured based on various factors  including evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of the company s customers that could result in the inability to collect the receivable balance 
in situations where it is unclear whether the company will be able to collect the receivable  revenue and related costs are deferred 
related costs are recognized when it has been determined that the collection of the receivable is unlikely 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the cost of inventories is determined by using the first in  first out method 
the company performs a monthly analysis of its inventory balances to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value 
the analysis of estimated realizable value is based on customer orders  market trends and historical pricing 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated net realizable value 
pension assets and liabilities pension assets and liabilities are affected by the estimated market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the company s pension projected benefit obligation was million at december   which was million higher than pension plan assets 
the december  liability was computed based on an average discount rate  which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of the company s pension liability 
the long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectations of the future economic environment 
in addition  the pension liability for the company s uk pension plan  which includes provisions to adjust benefit payments for general inflation rates  was estimated based on an average annual inflation rate 
declines in comparable bond yields or higher uk inflation rates would increase the company s pension liability 
the company s net pension liability  after deduction of plan assets  could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate 
the company engages third party actuarial specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring pension expense and valuing pension liabilities 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect a differences between financial statement carrying amounts and corresponding tax bases and b temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred tax assets also include the expected benefits of carrying forward the company s net operating losses 
the company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability and reduces them if the company cannot sufficiently determine that they will be realized 
the company bases this determination on projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 

table of contents at december   deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  representing future benefits for the company s us net operating loss carryforwards totaled million 
if there is a material change in the effective tax rates or time period when temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company may have to additionally reduce all or a significant portion of its deferred tax assets 
impairment of long lived assets management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets when indicators of impairment exist 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales demand  production levels  prices and costs  inflation  discount rates  currency exchange rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
all assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are consistent with management s internal planning 
during  no events occurred that indicated that the carrying amount of any of the company s assets may not be recoverable 
however  due to the mothballed status of the beaumont  texas facility  management performs an annual impairment analysis of such assets 
as of december   the beaumont assets had a carrying value  net of million of deferred revenues  of approximately million 
the company estimated the remaining useful life of the beaumont facility at years  assuming normal investment in maintenance and replacement capital throughout this year period 
the estimated cash flows over this year period were based on the company s best estimate of future market and operating conditions at december  the estimated cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the beaumont assets  therefore  no impairment charge was recorded 
the cash flow estimates were made with the assumption that the beaumont facility will remain idle through  the term of the company s contract with methanex  and that once restarted  the beaumont facility will produce at historic rates and selling prices will be adequate to realize historic margins 
results of continuing operations compared with consolidated results the company reported net income of million on revenues of billion compared with a net income of million on revenues of billion 
diluted income loss per share for was compared with for the net income included a million million  net of tax loss related to the early retirement of debt and a million million  net of tax gain relating to change in fair value of warrants 
the company classifies its operations into two business segments nitrogen products and methanol 
the nitrogen products segment represents the sale of nitrogen products including that produced at the company s ammonia manufacturing and upgrading facilities 
the methanol segment represents sales of methanol including that produced at the company s two methanol manufacturing facilities

this contract expires in october 
table of contents the company s pension projected benefit obligations were million at december   which was million higher than its pension plan assets 
the pension projected benefit obligations were computed based on a discount rate  which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds moody s investor service aa rated or equivalent with a maturity approximating the duration of the company s pension obligation 
future declines in comparable bond yields would increase the company s pension obligation and future increases in bond yields would decrease the company s pension obligation 
the company s pension obligation  net of plan assets  could increase or decrease depending on the extent that returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate 
in addition  the pension obligation for the company s uk pension plan  which includes provisions to adjust benefit payments for general inflation rates  was estimated based on a inflation rate 
the company s pension obligation could increase or decrease based on actual uk inflation rates 
the company s cash contributions to pension plans were million in and are estimated at million in actual contributions could vary from these estimates depending on the company s funding decisions  actual returns for plan assets  legislative changes to pension funding requirements and or plan amendments 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million in because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
the company does not expect compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
the company incurred million of capital expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
the company may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
the company estimates that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in  and and beyond will be less than million in the aggregate

recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 
fin requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position must be more likely than not ie greater than likelihood of receiving a benefit before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
further  fin prescribes the benefit to be recorded in the financial statements as the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions 
fin also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective in the first quarter for the 
table of contents company 
the company has performed a preliminary analysis of its income tax position and does not expect a significant impact to its financial statements as a result of adopting the interpretation 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas is definitional and disclosure oriented and addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  it does not create or modify any current gaap requirements to apply fair value accounting 
sfas provides a single definition for fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications  and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and input used in valuations 
sfas prescribes various disclosures about financial statement categories and amounts which are measured at fair value  if such disclosures are not already specified elsewhere in gaap 
the new measurement and disclosure and requirements of sfas are effective for the company in first quarter and the company expects no significant impact from adopting the standard 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas 
sfas focuses primarily on balance sheet reporting for the funded status of benefit plans and requires recognition of benefit liabilities for under funded plans and benefit assets for over funded plans  with offsetting impacts to shareholders equity 
these changes are required to be adopted prospectively  effective with the company s december  financial statements 
the company is in a net under funded position for its pension and retiree health care plans  which resulted in a million impact as a result of adopting sfas the million impact of adopting sfas increased accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets by million and million  respectively 
sfas will also require companies to measure benefit plan assets and liabilities and determine the discount rate for subsequent year expense recognition as of the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes  thus eliminating the opportunity to use a measurement of date up to days prior to the balance sheet date
