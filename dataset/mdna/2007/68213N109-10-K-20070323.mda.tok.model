item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
when used in combination  our products and services provide healthcare facilities with a comprehensive solution designed to enhance patient safety and improve operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east and south america 
in  we manufactured the majority of our systems in our california facility and refurbishment and spare parts activities were conducted in our illinois facility 
in november  we began manufacturing sub assemblies at a single source manufacturing supplier to provide increased manufacturing capacity 
we also increased our inventory levels  allowing for greater levels of installations 
in  we established a subsidiary in india  omnicell corporation india private limited 
this subsidiary is focused on software product development and customer support 
a substantial number of our u 
s employees involved in sales  customer support and installation work remotely 
in general  we recognize revenue when our medication dispensing and supply automation systems are installed 
installation generally takes place six to nine months after our systems are ordered 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and additional time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete their acceptance of the installation of our systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customer s pace 
the amount of revenue recognized in future periods may depend on  among other things  the terms and timing of lease contract renewals  additional product sales and the size of such transactions 
we believe that future revenue will be affected by the competitiveness of our products and services 
we generate substantially all of our revenues in the united states 
our business grew substantially  from million of revenue in to million of revenue in we believe that three factors were primarily responsible for this growth we have continued to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to create the best customer experience in healthcare  we have delivered industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses and pharmacists  and the market environment of increased patient safety awareness and increased regulatory control has driven our solutions to be a high priority in customers capital budgets 
in addition to our revenue growth during  our product backlog consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  grew from million at december  to million at december   as customer orders for our products grew at a rate faster than we were able install 
our customers require well planned installations that provide them with a minimal amount of disruption 
installations  which coincide with full delivery of our obligations to our customers and therefore represent our point of revenue recognition  can take place anywhere from one week to months after an order is received for our products 
given our customers often lengthy installation schedules  we believe our current backlog level is appropriate for our industry and that the increase in backlog is an indicator of the success of our products in the marketplace and the increased attention we have given to carefully planning installations at large institutions and at new customer sites 
we believe that our overall business strategies are a key component to our success in achieving market acceptance of our products and services 
these key strategies include delivering solutions that are designed to provide our customers with the best experience in the healthcare industry by proactively anticipating and meeting customer needs  listening carefully to our customers prospective issues  and meeting and exceed our customers installation and support needs  and sustaining technological leadership in the development of our products by consistently innovating in our product and service offerings  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
in order to implement these strategies during  we increased our staff during the year to meet customer demands for products  installation and customer support  initiated a strategy to manufacture sub assemblies at manufacturing supplier locations  providing us the potential for increased manufacturing capacity  increased flexibility and reduced demands on working capital  increased our inventory levels  primarily in finished goods awaiting installation  increased the staffing at our subsidiary in india to take advantage of the large local talent pool and to improve our cost structure and to provide more resources to our customers  recruited technology and healthcare industry veterans to lead several significant functional areas of our business  including research and development  manufacturing  marketing and strategy and general and administrative functions  and placing increased emphasis on the integration of prior acquisitions to provide customers with higher level of technology integration in our product offerings 
in  we generated positive cash flow from operations because our expenses grew at a slower pace than the overall growth in our revenues and working capital from operations 
additionally  no substantial investments in plant and equipment were needed 
as a result  we recorded cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  and had a cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  of million 
in  net cash used in operations was million and we had a cash and cash equivalent balance as of december  of million 
our ability to grow revenue and produce positive cash flow is dependent on our ability to continue to attract orders from customers  the volume of installations we are able to complete  our ability to access customer installation sites on a timely basis and our flexibility in manpower allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis 
the growth we have experienced has also required a substantial growth in our headcount 
during  we were successful in recruiting and integrating new staff members at all of our sites and in our field based organizations 
our full time employee headcount grew to at december  from at december  in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r revised share based payment or sfas no 
r  to record share based awards compensation costs 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million 
the impact on net income per share for the year ended december  was per share basic and per share diluted 
we anticipate that the growth rate of our cost of product revenue and expenses from share based compensation  may  at times  exceed the future growth rate of our revenues 
we have initiated long term compensation vehicles other than employee stock options to help reduce the future cost of share based compensation programs such as a management by objective program 
our gross margin improved for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increased operational leverage and improved operating efficiencies obtained by expanding our installation process in a measured fashion 
however  we believe that our gross margin could decline in as compared to as a result of market price reductions  additional costs to expand our business and expenses from share based compensation expenses 
this decrease in our gross margin may be wholly or partially offset by revenue growth in as compared to  and by component and sub assembly cost reductions 
in  in an effort to provide greater product volume  we initiated a change in our manufacturing process by securing a single source third party manufacturing supplier to build sub assemblies used in our hardware products 
for  we expect our third party manufacturing supplier to build a substantial portion of the sub assemblies which we currently build at our manufacturing facility in california and we expect our inventory level to decrease as a result 
we anticipate reducing our risk of dependence on a single source supplier by establishing additional supplier manufacturing relationships and by securing single source supplier secondary manufacturing sites 
profitability of our business grew steadily during because of efficiencies gained in our cost structure by adding headcount at a slower pace than the growth of revenue 
we have invested in customer facing portions of our business  in research and development and in infrastructure  but at a slower pace than demand for our products has grown 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in our business to support future growth generated by increased market demand 
we operate in one business segment  the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
our management team evaluates our performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
product delivery 
software and hardware delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter providing evidence that we have delivered what the customer ordered 
product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter in instances of a customer self installed installation 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
we recognize sales on shipment to distributors since we do not allow for rights of return 
in general  for sales not requiring our installation or modification  we recognize sales on shipment of products to our customers 
we separately sell training and professional services which are not part of multiple element arrangements and not integral to the performance of our systems 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
vsoe of training and of professional services is based on the price paid when sold separately 
a portion of our sales is made through multi year lease agreements 
we generally sell our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis and recognize revenue on these leases at the net present value of the lease payment stream 
we exclude from revenues amounts paid to us for a new sale that relate to the termination of an existing lease 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease is sold 
some of our lease sales  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house as sales type leases which we account for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we recognize revenues on sales type leases at completion of our installation obligation  if any  and at the beginning of the non cancelable payment terms 
the revenue recognized is calculated at the net present value of the future payment stream 
interest income in sales type leases is recognized in product revenue using the interest method 
provision for reserves 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables and our net investment in sales type leases based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
valuation and impairment of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our accounting of goodwill and intangible assets complies with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the expected useful lives of the assets 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we review long lived assets and certain goodwill and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost utilizing standard costs  which approximate the first in  first out method or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
in we adopted sfas no 
r  and selected a modified prospective transition method using the black scholes merton option price method for determining and for recording the fair value of share based awards compensation costs 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using of certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility which is based on the historical market price of our stock  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
accounting for taxes on income 
we provide for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 income tax expense benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred taxes take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to prevent an unused loss carry forward or unused tax credit carry forward from expiring 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially affecting our results of operations and financial position

new product features  the overall hospital medication safety regulatory environment  and an increased interest in automation products in hospitals contributed to these increases 
cost of product revenues increased by million  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in direct material cost and manufacturing costs associated with increasing volume unit sales and with changes in our product mix  a million increase in labor costs  including a million share compensation charge associated with sfas no 
r  a million increase in support expenses and a million increase in the product cost of revenues associated with the current year shift of service staff costs previously associated with general and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in standard costs in  and by a million cost of excess and obsolete inventory which occurred in gross profit on product revenue increased by million  or in as compared to  primarily as a result of higher product revenues and improving margins due to changes in product mix and improved efficiencies and interest income recognized in association with our net investment in sales type leases 
compared to product revenues decreased by million  or in as compared to the decrease in product revenues was due to decreased product installations due primarily to the realignment of our direct sales force dividing them into a product focused sales organization to bring more focus to our supply products offerings 
this transition led to delays in customers placing orders and contributed to lower product installation revenues 
in addition  we changed our business model to slow the pace of installations to improve the customer experience in working with us 
this change lead to a significant growth in product order backlog as customer demand rebounded during the remainder of cost of product revenues increased by million  or in as compared to cost of product revenues increased due to a higher mix of original equipment manufacturer product whose costs are relatively higher as a percent of revenue than product we manufacture ourselves  and a million charge in associated with the write off of end of product life for our suremed products 
this increase was partially offset by lower costs associated with our outsourcing strategy 
gross profit declined million  or in as compared to primarily due to a million write off of end of product life for our suremed products and a revenue decline associated with the realignment of our sales force

service and other revenues increased by million  or in as compared to the increases in service and other revenues was primarily due to the result of an expansion in our installed base of automation systems and a resulting increase in number of support service contracts 
cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to million increase in salary and benefits costs in support of the expanded service base  including a million stock compensation charge associated with sfas no 
r and a million shift of service staff expenses previously associated with general and administrative expenses in compared to gross profit on service and other revenues increased by million  or in as compared to the increase in gross profit margin on service and other revenues was due primarily to year over year expansion in our installed base and a resulting increase in the number of support service contracts 
compared to service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase in service and other revenues was primarily due to the increase in our installed base of automation systems combined with an increase in the number of multi year payment term sales with service contracts 
cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase in cost of service and other revenues was due to costs associated with the growth of certain of our emerging product lines for installation and support services and for increased material costs used in supporting the installed base 
gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in  compared to million  or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross profit margin on service and other revenues reflects a reduction in cost from the transition from an outsourced service model to an internal service organization which was completed in operating expenses for the years ended december  change to to in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring  facility and severance charges total operating expenses compared to research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to a million increase in salary and benefits  other labor and recruiting costs  a million increase in expenses related to share based compensation charges associated with sfas no 
r and a million increase in support costs related to increased headcount and higher research and development activity 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in outside services associated with software development and acquired technology costs in we expect research and development expenses to grow in absolute dollars due to planned additional spending to improve and enhance our existing technologies and in creation of new technologies in health care automation 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
in  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in salary and benefits costs  including a million increase in share based compensation charges associated with sfas no 
r  a million increase in gpo expenses associated with the higher sales volume  a million increase in advertising expenses and a million increase in travel expenses associated with increased support of the higher level of sales revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the expenses from prior year restructuring and by million due to a shift of service staff costs previously associated with general and administrative departmental expenses to cost of product revenues and cost of service and other revenues 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars as we continue to add headcount to support a greater unit volume of customer sales and to support the installation of customer orders 
restructuring and facility charges 
we did not incur any restructuring and facility charges in restructuring and facility charges were million in compared to research and development 
research and development increased by million  or in compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to a million decrease in outside services associated with software development and acquired technology costs in  partially offset by reduction in costs associated with our beta site testing 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to approximately a million increase in costs due to a higher level of sales headcount  million in costs associated with a reduction in workforce  a million charge for restructuring  an additional million in the year over year increase in accounting  legal and regulatory compliance fees and a million charge for the write off of costs associated with abandoned acquisitions 
restructuring and facility charges 
restructuring and facility charges were million in and million in income taxes we use the liability method for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
taxes are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense 
years ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
due to our recent operating history  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we have provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
in the event that these deferred tax assets are recognized in the future  income tax expense will be reduced by million and million will be credited to additional paid in capital for the benefit associated with stock option deductions 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the short form method to calculate the tax effects of stock based compensation 
under the short form method  we use the cumulative effect of award grants to establish its hypothetical apic pool related to the tax effects of the employee stock based compensation as if we had adopted the recognition provisions of sfas no 
since its effective date of january  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from january  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   as compared to million at december  cash flows operating activities generated million of cash during the year ended december  significant contributors to the generation of cash from operations were net income of million  non cash adjustments to income for share based compensation charges associated with sfas no 
r of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventories of million  increases in accrued compensation of million  advance customer deposits of million  accounts payable of million  deferred service revenue million  deferred gross profit of million and accrued liabilities of million 
these were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  inventory of million  prepaid expenses of million  other current assets of million and net investment in sales type leases of million 
we used million of cash for operating activities in we used million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december  we purchased million in property and equipment and acquired million in intellectual property 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  we generated million and million of cash from exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan during the years ended december  and  respectively 
other as of december  we had million in contractual commitments to third parties for non cancelable operating leases  commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers and other purchase commitments 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information with respect to these commitments 
our liquidity is primarily based on normal ongoing operations of our business 
we believe our current cash balances and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through however  we may be required or choose to raise additional capital through the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements or debt 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to execute our business plan 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the instructions thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our activities give rise to market risk representing the potential loss in the fair value of assets caused by future movements in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates related to components of our product backlog composed of offers to non us government customers for multi year  non cancelable payment terms 
generally we sell non us government receivables to third party leasing finance companies  and we reflect the financing interest expense on the sale of these receivables as a component of our revenue 
we record our revenue at the net present value of the multi year payment stream using the contractual interest rate charged us by the third party leasing company 
as interest rates rise  the level of future revenue associated with these orders may fall 
sensitivity analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates from actual year end interest rates related to underlying exposure of product backlog described above 
as of december  the analysis indicated that this hypothetical market movements would have an adverse effect of approximately million on our consolidated results of operations
