critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas that either require significant judgement by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  the company s estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve required as outlined below customers that have refused to pay their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  higher lower than expected defaults or an unexpected material change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at december  and december   the company reported inventory of million and million  respectively

and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of the net benefit cost from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets  as significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost 
the plan assets produced an actual return of approximately in if significant  the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on relevant market indices citigroup pension liability index  moody s aa corporate bond yield and bloomberg aaa aa year 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at december   the company determined this rate to be on a consolidated basis 
as of december   the company s consolidated pension liability was million  up from million at the end of for the year ended december   the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million  up from million in due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a result of an increase in the weighted average discount rate and other actuarial gains and losses  the company estimates its net periodic cost to decrease by approximately 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at december  of million 
deferred tax assets the company applies a three year cumulative taxable income test for foreign subsidiaries whose results are not included in the us tax return in determining whether to recognize an income tax benefit for their respective foreign nol carryforwards  with a resultant adjustment to the valuation allowance 
qualitative factors surrounding a particular subsidiary are also examined and  in certain circumstances eg  projections of further losses for that subsidiary in the short term  an income tax benefit may not be recorded and therefore  the valuation allowance not adjusted even when the three year cumulative taxable income is positive for a given subsidiary 
tax contingencies the company believes it has a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions it takes on the various tax returns it files 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may take opposing views on some issues  that the costs and hazards of litigation in maintaining the positions that the company has taken on various returns might be significant and that the taxing authorities may prevail in their attempts to overturn such positions  the company maintains tax reserves 
the amounts of such reserves  the potential issues they are intended to cover and their adequacy to do so are topics of frequent review internally and with outside tax professionals 
where necessary  periodic adjustments are made to such reserves to reflect the lapsing of statutes of limitations  closings of ongoing examinations or the commencement of new examinations 
as of december   the company has recorded a current income tax payable of million 
the aggregate amount of global income tax reserves and related interest recorded in current taxes payable was approximately million 
these reserves cover a wide range of issues and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions 
the single largest item million relates to a dispute with the state of wisconsin concerning income taxes payable upon the sale of a short line railroad that operated solely within such state 
other significant exposures for which reserves exist include  but are not limited to  a variety of foreign jurisdictional transfer pricing disputes and foreign withholding tax issues related to inter company transfers and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currencies  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income

approximately  and of the company s sales were denominated in foreign currency in  and  respectively 
the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to canada canadian dollar and europe euro and british pound 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as venezuela bolivar  brazil real and mexico peso 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  as the company s subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in currencies other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the translation risk 
as of december  and december   the company had a significant amount of assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the absolute value of these assets and liabilities at december  and december   was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company has purchased approximately million of short term foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
if there were a percent adverse change in the exchange rates  the company would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
as of december  and december   the company utilized interest rate agreements that effectively fix or cap  for a period of time  the gbp london interbank offered rate gbp libor and the bankers acceptance canadian dollar offered rate ba cdor components of the interest rates on a portion of its floating rate obligations 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of gbp million and million canadian 
at december  the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of gbp million and million canadian 
the gbp libor swap agreements obligate the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through july and the ba cdor swap agreement obligated the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through december at december  and december   the interest rate on and of debt obligations  respectively  was fixed 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its derivatives and other financial instruments assuming a adverse change in interest rates and a adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would have increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively  and decreased the value of foreign currency forward contracts by million and million in and  respectively 
the estimated fair market value of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would decrease by and for and  respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and for and  respectively 
changes in the market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
these analyses did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  the company could take action to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
