item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations review of fiscal year results of operations weeks compared to fiscal year weeks for fiscal year losses directly related to customer bankruptcies 
as one of the many participants in the us and regional textile and apparel supply chain  the company s business and competitive position are directly impacted by the business and financial condition of the other participants across the supply chain in which it operates  including other regional yarn manufacturers  knitters and weavers 
if other supply chain participants are unable to access capital  fund their operations and make required technological and other investments in their businesses or experience diminished demand for their products  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
failure to implement future technological advances in the textile industry or fund capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and net sales 
the company s operating results depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to introduce innovative products and applications and to continue to develop its production processes to be a competitive producer 
accordingly  to maintain its competitive position and its revenue base  the company must continually 
table of contents modernize its manufacturing processes  plants and equipment 
to this end  the company has made significant investments in its manufacturing infrastructure over the past fifteen years and does not currently anticipate any significant additional capital expenditures to replace or expand its production facilities over the next five years 
accordingly  the company expects its capital requirements in the near term will be used primarily to maintain its manufacturing operations  but future technological advances in the textile industry may result in the availability of new products or increase the efficiency of existing manufacturing and distribution systems  and the company may not be able to adapt to such technological changes or offer such products on a timely basis or establish or maintain competitive positions if it does not incur significant capital expenditures for expansion purposes 
existing  proposed or yet undeveloped technologies may render its technology less profitable or less viable  and the company may not have available the financial and other resources to compete effectively against companies possessing such technologies 
to the extent sources of funds are insufficient to meet its ongoing capital improvement requirements  the company would need to seek alternative sources of financing or curtail or delay capital spending plans 
the company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the company is unable to predict which of the many possible future products and services will meet the evolving industry standards and consumer demands 
if the company fails to make the capital improvements necessary to continue the modernization of its manufacturing operations and reduction of its costs  its competitive position may suffer  and its net sales may decline 
unforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of the company s facilities may cause significant lost production  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s manufacturing process could be affected by operational problems that could impair its production capability 
each of its facilities contains complex and sophisticated machines that are used in its manufacturing process 
disruptions at any of its facilities could be caused by maintenance outages  prolonged power failures or reductions  a breakdown  failure or substandard performance of any of its machines  the effect of noncompliance with material environmental requirements or permits  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels or roads  fires  floods  earthquakes or other catastrophic disasters  labor difficulties  or other operational problems 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of its facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company has made and may continue to make investments in entities that it does not control 
the company has established joint ventures and made minority interest investments designed to increase its vertical integration  increase efficiencies in its procurement  manufacturing processes  marketing and distribution in the united states and other markets 
the company s principal joint ventures and minority investments include unf  unifi sans technical fibers  llc ustf  pal and yihua unifi fibre industry company limited yufi 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations joint ventures and other equity investments for a further discussion 
the company s inability to control entities in which it invests may affect its ability to receive distributions from those entities or to fully implement its business plan 
the incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by an entity not under its control may result in restrictions or prohibitions on that entity s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
even where these entities are not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions  the company may not be able to influence the occurrence or timing of such distributions 
in addition  if any of the other investors in these entities fails to observe its commitments  that entity may not be able to operate according to its business plan or the company may be required to increase its level of commitment 
if any of these events were to occur  its business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
because the company does not own a majority or maintain voting control of these entities  the company does not have the ability to control their policies  management or affairs 
the interests of persons who control these entities or partners may differ from the company s  and they may cause such entities to take actions which are not in its best interest 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its partners in these entities  the company could lose its ability to operate in these areas which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents the company s acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could adversely affect its business 
the company has expanded its business partly through acquisitions and may continue to make selective acquisitions 
the company s acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  obtaining financing on acceptable terms  and its ability to comply with the restrictions contained in its debt agreements 
acquisitions may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of its business 
future acquisitions may also have an adverse effect on its operating results  particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following their completion while the company integrates the operations of the acquired business 
growth by acquisition involves risks that could have a material adverse effect on business and financial results  including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired companies 
once integrated  acquired operations may not achieve the levels of revenues  profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by its existing operations  or otherwise performs as expected 
while the company has experience in identifying and integrating acquisitions  the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain the capital necessary to pursue its acquisition strategy or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all 
even if the company successfully completes an acquisition  it may not be able to integrate it into its business satisfactorily or at all 
increases of illegal transshipment of textile and apparel goods into the united states could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
according to industry experts and trade associations illegal transshipments of apparel products into the united states continues to negatively impact the textile market 
illegal transshipment involves circumventing quotas by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are a product of a particular country of origin or include yarn of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional free trade agreements  such as nafta and cafta 
if illegal transshipment is not monitored and enforcement is not effective  these shipments could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company is subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities or cause interruptions in its operations 
the company is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  the protection of the environment and the use or cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes 
the company may incur substantial costs  including fines  damages and criminal or civil sanctions  or experience interruptions in its operations for actual or alleged violations of or compliance requirements arising under environmental laws  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s operations could result in violations of environmental laws  including spills or other releases of hazardous substances to the environment 
in the event of a catastrophic incident  the company could incur material costs 
in addition  the company could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws 
for example  the land associated with the kinston acquisition is leased pursuant to a year ground lease with dupont 
since  dupont has been investigating and cleaning up the kinston site under the supervision of the epa and the north carolina department of environment and natural resources pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act corrective action program 
the corrective action program requires dupont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern  known as solid waste management units or areas of concern  assess the extent of contamination at the identified areas and clean them up to applicable regulatory standards 
under the terms of the ground lease  upon completion by dupont of required remedial action  ownership of the kinston site will pass to the company 
thereafter  the company will have responsibility for future remediation requirements  if any  at the solid waste management units and areas of concern previously addressed by dupont and at any other areas at the plant 
at this time  the company has no basis to determine if and when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to contaminated solid waste management units and areas of concern or the extent of any potential liability for the same 
accordingly  the possibility that the company could face material clean up costs in the future relating to the kinston facility cannot be eliminated 
capital expenditures and  to a lesser extent  costs and operating expenses relating to environmental or safety matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the 
table of contents promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on its operations 
therefore  capital expenditures beyond those currently anticipated may be required under existing or future environmental or safety laws 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources environmental liabilities 
furthermore  the company may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from its properties or at off site locations where the company disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated the purchase of its businesses 
if significant previously unknown contamination is discovered  existing laws or their enforcement change or its indemnities do not cover the costs of investigation and remediation  then such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 
health and safety regulation costs could increase 
the company s operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration and comparable statutes in foreign jurisdictions where the company operates 
the company believes that it employs appropriate precautions to protect its employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at its facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against the company for work related illnesses or injury  and changes in occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates could increase its operating costs 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  the company may become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or be found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceedings  and such costs may be material to us 
the company s business may be adversely affected by adverse employee relations 
the company employs approximately  employees  approximately  of which are domestic employees and approximately of which are foreign employees 
while employees of its foreign operations are generally unionized  none of its domestic employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements with employees of the company s foreign operations and other labor relations issues  including union organizing activities  could result in an increase in costs or lead to a strike  work stoppage or slow down 
such labor issues and unrest by its employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company is required to assess the impairment of the company s long lived assets  such as plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
when the company determines that the carrying value of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more impairment indicators  the company then measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 any such impairment charges will be recorded as operating losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations review of fiscal year results of operations weeks compared to fiscal year weeks for fiscal year impairment charges relating to long lived assets 
in addition  the company evaluates the net values assigned to various equity investments it holds  such as its investment in yufi  pal  ustf and unf  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
apb no 
requires that a loss in value of an investment  which is other than a temporary decline  should be recognized as an impairment loss 
any such impairment losses will be recorded as operating losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations joint ventures and other equity investments for more information regarding the company s equity investments 

table of contents any operating losses resulting from impairment charges under sfas no 
or apb no 
could have an adverse effect on its net income and therefore the market price of its securities  including its common stock 
the company s business could be adversely affected if the company fails to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  licenses  confidentiality and other agreements to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  this protection may not be fully adequate its intellectual property rights may be challenged or invalidated  an infringement suit by the company against a third party may not be successful and or third parties could design around its technology or adopt trademarks similar to its own 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which its products are manufactured and sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although the company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  independent contractors and current and potential strategic and joint venture partners  among others  such agreements may be breached  and the company could be harmed by unauthorized use or disclosure of its confidential information 
further  the company licenses trademarks from third parties  and these agreements may terminate or become subject to litigation 
its failure to protect its intellectual property could materially and adversely affect its competitive position  reduce revenue or otherwise harm its business 
the company may also be accused of infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of third parties 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of its personnel 
should the company be found liable for infringement  the company may be required to enter into licensing arrangements if available on acceptable terms or at all or pay damages and cease selling certain products or using certain product names or technology 
the company s failure to prevail in any intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect its competitive position  reduce revenue or otherwise harm its business

recent developments and outlook although the global textile and apparel industry continues to grow  the us textile and apparel industry has contracted since  caused primarily by intense foreign competition in finished goods on the basis of price  resulting in ongoing us domestic overcapacity  forcing the closure of many domestic textile and apparel plants and many producer s to move their operations offshore 
in addition  due to consumer preferences  demand for sheer hosiery products has declined significantly in recent years  which negatively impacts nylon manufacturers 
as a result  the contraction in the north american textile and apparel market continues  and industry experts expect a similar rate of decline in calendar year as compared to calendar year  and a lower rate of decline after calendar year as regional manufacturers continue to demand north american manufactured yarn due to the duty free advantage  quick response times  readily available production capacity  and specialized products and north american retailers expressing their need for a balanced procurement strategy with both global and regional producers 
because of these general industry trends  the company s net sales  gross profits and net income have been trending downward for the past several years 
these challenges continue to impact the us textile and apparel industry  and the company expects that they will continue to impact the us textile and apparel industry for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that its success going forward is primarily based on its ability to improve the mix of its product offerings by shifting to more premium value added products  to exploit the free trade agreements to which the united states is a party and to implement cost saving strategies which will improve its operating efficiencies 
the continued viability of the us domestic textile and apparel industry is dependent  to a large extent  on the international trade regulatory environment 
for the most part  because of protective duties currently in place and nafta  cafta  cbi  atpa and other free trade agreements or duties preference programs  the company has not experienced significant declines in its market share due to the importation of asian products 
the company is highly committed to its existing interest in china where industry experts estimate that the production growth rate for the polyester textile filament yarns will be at a to annual average rate between and as further discussed below in joint ventures and other equity investments  the company has invested in excess of million in a joint venture in china to manufacture  process and market polyester filament yarn

allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for losses is provided for known and potential losses arising from yarn quality claims and for amounts owed by customers 
reserves for yarn quality claims are based on historical claim experience and known pending claims 
the collectability of accounts receivable is based on a combination of factors including the aging of accounts receivable  historical write off experience  present economic conditions such as chapter bankruptcy filings within the industry and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
since losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions  and the health of the textile industry  a significant level of judgment is required to arrive at the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts are written off when they are no longer deemed to be collectible 
the reserve for bad debts is established based on certain percentages applied to accounts receivable aged for certain periods of time and are supplemented by specific reserves for certain customer accounts where collection is no longer certain 
the company s exposure to losses as of june  on accounts receivable was million against which an allowance for losses of million was provided

impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  a impairment may occur if projected undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
in such cases  additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of loss to be recognized 
the impairment loss is determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value measured by future discounted cash flows 
the analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and  where applicable  judgments associated with  among other factors  the appropriate discount rate 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary

for assets held for disposal  an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
estimates are required of fair value  disposal costs and the time period to dispose of the assets 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
actual cash flows received or paid could differ from those used in estimating the impairment loss  which would impact the impairment charge ultimately recognized and the company s cash flows

impairment of joint venture investments 
the accounting principles board opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb states that the inability of the equity investee to sustain sufficient earnings to justify its carrying value on an other than temporary basis should be assessed for impairment purposes 
the company evaluates its equity investments at least annually to determine whether there is evidence that an investment has been permanently impaired 
as of june  the company had completed its evaluations of its equity investees and determined that its investment in pal was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a million non cash impairment charge 
see footnote impairment charges for further discussion of this impairment charge 
accruals for costs related to severance of employees and related health care costs 
from time to time  the company establishes accruals associated with employee severance or other cost reduction initiatives 
such accruals require that estimates be made about the future payout of various costs  including  for example  health care claims 
the company uses historical claims data and other available information about expected future health care costs to estimate its projected liability 
such costs are subject to change due to a number of factors  including the incidence rate for health care claims  prevailing health care costs and the nature of the claims submitted  among others 
consequently  actual expenses could differ from those expected at the time the provision was estimated  which may impact the valuation of accrued liabilities and results of operations 
the company s estimates have been materially accurate in the past  and accordingly  at this time management expects to continue to utilize the present estimation processes 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the specifically identified deferred tax assets which may not be recoverable are investment and real property impairment charges  state income 
table of contents tax credits and charitable contribution carryforwards 
the company s realization of some of its deferred tax assets is based on future taxable income within a certain time period and is therefore uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews its estimates of future taxable income over a period of years to assess if the need for a valuation allowance exists 
to forecast future taxable income  the company uses historical profit before tax amounts which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on various factors  including perceived trends  and then applies expected changes to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on when they reverse in the future 
at june   the company had a gross deferred tax liability of approximately million relating specifically to property  plant and equipment 
reversal of this deferred tax liability through depreciation is the primary item generating future taxable income 
actual future taxable income may vary significantly from management s projections due to the many complex judgments and significant estimations involved  which may result in adjustments to the valuation allowance which may impact the net deferred tax liability and provision for income taxes 
management and the company s audit committee discussed the development  selection and disclosure of all of the critical accounting estimates described above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates and currency fluctuation rates  which may adversely affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the company is also exposed to other risks in the operation of its business 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowing activities  which are further described in note  long term debt and other liabilities 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in long term fixed rate bonds 
therefore  the market rate risk associated with a basis point change in interest rates would not be material to the company s results of operation at the present time 
currency exchange rate risk the company conducts its business in various foreign currencies 
as a result  it is subject to the transaction exposure that arises from foreign exchange rate movements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are recorded export sales and purchases commitments and the dates they are consummated cash receipts and cash disbursements in foreign currencies 
the company utilizes some natural hedging to mitigate these transaction exposures 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts for the purchase and sale of european and north american currencies to hedge balance sheet and income statement currency exposures 
these contracts are principally entered into for the purchase of inventory and equipment and the sale of company products into export markets 
counter parties for these instruments are major financial institutions 
if the derivative is a hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes nor is it a party to any leveraged financial instruments 
currency forward contracts are used to hedge exposure for sales in foreign currencies based on specific sales orders with customers or for anticipated sales activity for a future time period 
generally  of the sales value of these orders is covered by forward contracts 
maturity dates of the forward contracts are intended to match anticipated receivable collections 
the company marks the outstanding accounts receivable and forward contracts to market at month end and any realized and unrealized gains or losses are recorded as other income and expense 
the company also enters currency forward contracts for committed or anticipated equipment and inventory purchases 
generally  of the asset cost is covered by forward contracts although of the asset cost may be covered by contracts in certain instances 
forward contracts are matched with the anticipated date of delivery of the assets and gains and losses are recorded as a component of the asset cost for purchase transactions when the company is firmly committed 
the latest maturity for all outstanding purchase and sales foreign currency forward contracts are august and september  respectively 

table of contents the dollar equivalent of these forward currency contracts and their related fair values are detailed below june  june  june  amounts in thousands foreign currency purchase contracts notional amount fair value net gain loss foreign currency sales contracts notional amount fair value net gain loss the fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts at the respective year end dates are based on discounted year end forward currency rates 
the total impact of foreign currency related items that are reported on the line item other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations  including transactions that were hedged and those that were not hedged  was a pre tax gain of million for the fiscal year ended june   a pre tax loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   and a pre tax gain of million for the fiscal year ended june  inflation and other risks the inflation rate in most countries the company conducts business has been low in recent years and the impact on the company s cost structure has not been significant 
the company is also exposed to political risk  including changing laws and regulations governing international trade such as quotas  tariffs and tax laws 
the degree of impact and the frequency of these events cannot be predicted
