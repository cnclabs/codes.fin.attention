among the numerous new product launches  we released the industry s first gender solutions knee femoral  the trabecular metal primary hip prosthesis  the trabecular metal acetabular revision system  the durom acetabular cup with metasul large diameter heads  the versys epoch composite hip stem  the trilogy ab ceramic on ceramic acetabular system  the zimmer reverse and inverse anatomical shoulder systems  the mis femoral nailing solution  the ncb plating system  the trinica anterior lumbar plate system  the dynesys dynamic stabilization system with hydroxyapatite ha coated screws  trabecular metal thoracolumbar components and the copios bone void filler sponge 
other new product  surgical technique and instrument introductions in the orthopaedic reconstructive implants  spine implants  trauma  orthopaedic surgical products and orthobiologics product categories are more fully described above under the captions products and orthobiologics 
these and other new products introduced in the last three years accounted for approximately percent of total sales  exceeding our new products sales goal of to percent of total sales on an annual basis 
we are broadening our product offerings in each of the product categories and exploring new technologies that have applications in multiple areas 
for the years ended december   and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development 
the increased research and development expenditures have accelerated the output of new orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants  spine and trauma products  including advanced new materials  product designs and surgical techniques 
our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw  indiana 
in  we made significant progress on our research and development facility expansion project in warsaw and construction is nearly complete 
we have other research and development personnel based in  among other places  winterthur  switzerland  austin  texas  minneapolis  minnesota  carlsbad  california  dover  ohio  and parsippany  new jersey 
as of december   we employed more than research and development employees worldwide 
we will continue to identify innovative technologies and consider acquiring complementary products or businesses  or establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 
government regulation and quality systems we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business 
it is our policy to comply with all regulatory requirements governing our operations and products  and we believe that the research  development  manufacturing and quality control procedures that we employ are in material compliance with all applicable regulations 
in the united states  numerous regulations govern the development  testing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of medical devices  including  among others  the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder 
the fda regulates product safety and efficacy  laboratory  clinical and manufacturing practices  labeling and record keeping for medical devices and post market surveillance to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices 
a few of the devices we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre market approval requirements 
all of our products marketed in the united states have been cleared or approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices  detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices  or order the repair  replacement or refund of the costs of such devices 
there are also certain requirements of state  local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 
in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products  we are subject to local regulations affecting  among other things  design and product standards  packaging requirements and labeling requirements 
many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda 
the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive  which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries 
these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in european union member countries to provide ce marking of their products 
we maintain an iso certified quality system and comply with the requirements of the medical device directive which  together  enable us to apply the ce mark to 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report products in those jurisdictions that require it europe  canada  australia and new zealand 
we are subject to various government regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and physician self referral laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  fines  imprisonment and  within the united states  exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs  including medicare  medicaid  veterans administration va health programs and civilian health and medical program uniformed service champus 
the scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws 
we are committed to providing high quality products to our customers and we have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization 
the quality assurance department supervises our quality systems 
senior management is actively involved in setting quality policies and managing internal and external quality performance 
our regulatory affairs and compliance department is responsible for assuring compliance with all applicable regulations  standards and internal policies 
we have initiated numerous quality improvement programs and all of our manufacturing operations are certified to iso global standard for quality management systems 
our facilities and operations are also subject to various government environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the united states and foreign countries  including those relating to discharges of substances in the air  water and land  the handling  storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants 
we believe we are currently in material compliance with such requirements 
competition the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive 
in the global markets for reconstructive implants  trauma and orthopaedic surgical products  our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics  inc a subsidiary of johnson johnson  stryker corporation  biomet  inc  synthes  inc  smith nephew plc  wright medical group  inc 
and tornier inc in the americas geographic segment  we and depuy orthopaedics  inc  stryker corporation  biomet  inc  smith nephew  inc 
a subsidiary of smith nephew plc  wright medical group  inc and synthes  inc  account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 
the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments 
the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction  for example  has fostered the existence of many regional european companies  including mathys ag and plus orthopedics holdings ag  which compete with us in addition to the global competitors 
today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for europe  although global products are gaining acceptance 
therefore  we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 
in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products  we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics  inc  stryker corporation  synthes  inc and smith nephew plc  as well as regional companies  including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing  inc factors  such as the dealer system  complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability to compete on price  make it difficult for smaller companies  particularly those that are non regional  to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 
in the dental reconstructive implant category  we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag  straumann holding ag  and implant innovations  inc a subsidiary of biomet  inc in the spinal implant category  we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek  inc a subsidiary of medtronic  inc  depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson johnson  synthes  inc  stryker corporation and ebi  lp  now operating as biomet trauma and biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet  inc 
competition within the industry is primarily based on technology  innovation  quality  reputation  customer relationships and service 
a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 
where possible  we will continue to seek patent  trademark and other intellectual property protection concerning the surgical techniques  materials  technologies and products we design and develop 
manufacturing and raw materials we manufacture substantially all of our products at eight locations  including warsaw  indiana  winterthur  switzerland  ponce  puerto rico  dover  ohio  statesville  north carolina  carlsbad  california  parsippany  new jersey  and etupes  france 
as part of the execution of the centerpulse integration plan  we liquidated our austin  texas facility in over the past two years  we have expanded our other manufacturing sites to accommodate increased demand  the transfer of production from the austin  texas facility and the tripling of trabecular metal technology production capacity 
we believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry standards in terms of automation and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth 
the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational improvement 
in addition  at certain of our manufacturing facilities  many of the employees are cross trained 
we generally operate our manufacturing facilities at a targeted goal of approximately percent of total capacity 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report we continually evaluate the potential to in source products currently purchased from outside vendors to on site production 
improving manufacturing productivity has been a major contributor to improvement in profitability 
major areas of improvement have included utilization of computer assisted robots and multi axis grinders to precision polish medical devices  automation of certain manufacturing and inspection processes including on machine inspection and process controls  state of the art equipment purchases and upgrades  in sourcing of core products  such as castings and forgings  high speed machining  and negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs 
we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the design  development and manufacturing of our products 
we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers 
in addition  we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance  sole source availability  cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 
we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability 
although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate unique technology  we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance 
to date  we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 
intellectual property patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods  including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors  employees  consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information 
we own or control through licensing arrangements more than  issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 
employees we employ more than  employees worldwide  including more than employees dedicated to research and development 
nearly  employees are located within the united states and more than  employees are located outside of the united states  primarily throughout europe and in japan 
we have over  employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide 
the warsaw  indiana production facility employs more than  employees 
fewer than north american employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
in may  we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america covering employees at the dover  ohio  facility 
this agreement will continue in effect until may  we are in preliminary negotiations with the union regarding the new agreement

item a 
risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our industry our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies  including orthobiological therapies 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies 
in the global markets for reconstructive orthopaedic implants  trauma products and other orthopaedic products  a limited number of competitors  including depuy orthopaedics  inc a subsidiary of johnson johnson  stryker corporation  biomet  inc  wright medical group  inc  synthes  inc 
and smith nephew plc  compete with us for the majority of product sales 
in the spinal implant category  we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek  inc a subsidiary of medtronic  inc  depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson johnson  synthes  inc  stryker corporation and ebi  lp a subsidiary of biomet  inc 
in the dental reconstructive implant category  we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag  straumann holding ag  and implant innovations  inc a subsidiary of biomet  inc 
competition is primarily on the basis of technology  innovation  quality  
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report reputation  relationships with customers  and service 
in markets outside of the united states  other factors influence competition as well  including local distribution systems  complex regulatory environments  and differing medical philosophies and product preferences 
our competitors may have greater financial  marketing and other resources than us  respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  or be more successful in attracting potential customers  employees and strategic partners 
any of these factors  alone or in combination  could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 
if third party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels  the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 
we sell our products and services to hospitals  doctors  dentists and other health care providers  all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to their patients from third party payors  such as domestic and international government programs  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
these third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost effective treatment methods  as determined by the third party payor  or was used for an unapproved indication 
third party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices 
if our products are not considered cost effective by third party payors  our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
for example  managed care programs often prescribe only those orthopaedic recovery products that match a patient as to age  need for mobility and other parameters in an effort to provide more cost effective care 
if third party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other health care providers for our products  demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in international markets  where the movement toward health care reform and the development of managed care are generally not as advanced as in the united states  we have experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of health care reform 
in japan  for example  a government operated insurance system reimburses customers for our products 
under this system  the japanese government periodically reviews and reduces the reimbursement levels for products 
if the japanese government continues to reduce the reimbursement level for orthopaedic products  our sales  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we are subject to cost containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs 
group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors  and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization s affiliated hospitals and other members 
if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization  affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products  and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer s products  we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement 
our failure to respond to the cost containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
we are involved in ongoing investigations by the united states department of justice of companies in the orthopaedics industry  the results of which may have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in march  we received a subpoena and we have received supplemental requests since that time from the united states department of justice through the united states attorney s office in newark  new jersey  requesting documents and related information for the period beginning january related to consulting contracts  professional service agreements and other agreements by which we may provide remuneration to orthopaedic surgeons  including research and other grant agreements 
in june  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice  antitrust division  requesting documents for the period beginning january through june  pertaining to an investigation of possible violations of federal criminal law  including possible violations of the antitrust laws  involving the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices 
we are cooperating fully with federal authorities with regard to these investigations  which we understand involve a number of other orthopaedic manufacturers as well 
if  as a result of these investigations  we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful  we may have to change those practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 
the medical devices we design  develop  manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities  can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable fda medical device or other material regulatory requirements  including  for example  the quality system regulation  recordkeeping regulations  labeling requirements and adverse event reporting regulations  that failure could result in  among other things warning letters  fines or civil penalties  injunctions  repairs  replacements or refunds  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of production  the fda s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications  and criminal prosecution 
any of these actions  in combination or alone  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products  we are subject to regulations affecting  among other things clinical efficacy  product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import export restrictions  tariff regulations  duties  and tax requirements 
many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries  such as the european medical devices directive  are similar to those of the fda 
in addition  in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility 
failure to receive or delays in the receipt of  relevant foreign qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as both the fda and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent  we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  such as the international standards organization 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our business will be harmed 
we are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulations that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 
our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and physician self referral laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  fines  imprisonment and  within the united states  exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs  including medicare  medicaid  veterans administration va health programs and civilian health and medical program uniformed service champus 
the scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 
because of the far reaching and uncertain nature of these laws  we are required to monitor our practices to remain in compliance with these laws 
if we were to violate one or more of these laws  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if there is a change in law  regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations  some of our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful and  as a result  we may have to change those practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur product liability losses  and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 
our business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings 
in addition  some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time 
in the ordinary course of business  we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients 
product liability lawsuits and claims  safety alerts or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 
as part of our risk management policy  we maintain third party product liability insurance coverage 
however  product liability claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a self insured loss 
even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy  these policies may have substantial retentions or deductibles that provide that we will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report the amount of those retentions or deductibles 
we will be responsible for paying any losses that are below those retentions or deductibles 
a product liability claim in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
risks related to our business if we fail to effectively utilize the skills and knowledge of orthopaedic surgeons  customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
we maintain professional relationships with a number of orthopaedic surgeons who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs 
these professionals speak about our products at medical seminars  assist in the training of other professionals in the use of our products and provide us with feedback on the industry s acceptance of our new products 
the failure of our products to retain the support of orthopaedic surgeons  who frequently recommend products or are involved in product selection decisions  or the failure of our new products to secure and retain similar support from surgeons  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products  customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the united states and abroad depends largely upon our agents and distributors sales and service expertise in the marketplace 
many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of products and instruments 
many commonly provide operating room personnel with implant and instrument product training as well as product support in the operating room 
a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if some of the business practices of our independent sales agents and distributors are challenged as unlawful  they may have to change these practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products may become obsolete over time  customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
demand for our products may change  in certain cases  in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving customer needs  changing demographics  slowing industry growth rates  declines in the reconstructive implant market  the introduction of new products and technologies  evolving surgical philosophies  and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products may become obsolete over time 
if that happens  our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify and anticipate customer needs  commercialize new products in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate our offerings from competitors offerings  achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products  satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors  providers and patients for shorter hospital stays  faster post operative recovery and lower cost procedures  innovate and develop new materials  product designs and surgical techniques  and provide adequate medical education relating to new products and attract key surgeons to advocate these new products 
in addition  new materials  product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly  in some or all markets  because of  among other factors entrenched patterns of clinical practice  the need for regulatory clearance  and uncertainty with respect to third party reimbursement 
moreover  innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products  these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the united states  which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 
because we sell our products in more than countries  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately  million  or of our total revenue  from sales of our products outside of the united states 
we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally  which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations 
our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements  differing local product preferences and product requirements  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the united states  
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  labor force instability  differing labor regulations  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  and political and economic instability 
any of these factors may  individually or as a group  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations  which can increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 
a substantial portion of our foreign generated revenues are generated in europe and japan 
the united states dollar value of our foreign generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen  as well as other currencies  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities  and on a limited basis  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the derivative financial instruments we enter into are in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions 
the forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings 
we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property  which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 
our long term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products 
if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection  we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies 
also  our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 
in the united states  patent applications are confidential for months following their filing  and because third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications  our patent applications may not have priority over patent applications of others 
in addition  our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products  or provide us with any competitive advantage 
if a third party initiates litigation regarding our patents  our collaborators patents  or those patents for which we have license rights  and is successful  a court could declare our patents invalid or unenforceable or limit the scope of coverage of those patents 
the united states patent and trademark office uspto and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents 
if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more broadly  the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and the risk of infringement litigation will likely increase 
on the other hand  if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more narrowly  the value of our proprietary rights may be reduced 
any changes in  or unexpected interpretations of  the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position 
competitors may also capture market share from us by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights 
if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenue 
we also rely upon trade secrets  proprietary know how  and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive 
we attempt to protect this information with security measures  including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  and corporate collaborators 
these individuals may breach these agreements and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages 
furthermore  our trade secrets  know how and other technology may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims  which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability  in some cases materially 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology 
if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights  any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing  selling or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement 
any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

form k annual report we may complete additional acquisitions  which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 
we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions 
we may not be able to complete additional acquisitions or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
acquiring and integrating new businesses involves risk  including the following we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned  which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable activities  the difficulties of integration may be increased if we need to integrate geographically separated organizations  personnel with disparate business backgrounds and companies with different corporate cultures  we may not eliminate as many redundant costs as we anticipated in selecting our acquisition candidates  and one or more of our acquisition candidates also may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we failed to discover through our diligence prior to the acquisition 
if we are unable to form strategic alliances  or if our strategic alliances fail to achieve their objectives  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
several of our strategic initiatives involve alliances with other orthopaedic and biotechnology companies 
these include our agreement with revivicor  inc relating to orthopaedic tissue technology  our collaboration with isto technologies  inc relating to regenerative cartilage technology and our distribution agreement with heraeus relating to orthopaedic bone cement products 
the success of these and similar arrangements is largely dependent on technology and other intellectual property contributed by our strategic partners or the resources  efforts  and skills of these partners 
disputes and difficulties in such relationships are common  often due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interest 
merger and acquisition activity may exacerbate these conflicts 
the benefits of these alliances are reduced or eliminated when strategic partners terminate the agreements or limit our access to the underlying intellectual property  fail to devote financial or other resources to the alliances and thereby hinder or delay development  manufacturing or commercialization activities  fail to successfully develop  manufacture or commercialize any products  or fail to maintain the financial resources necessary to continue financing their portion of the development  manufacturing  or commercialization costs or their own operations 
furthermore  under some of our strategic alliances  we may make milestone payments well in advance of commercialization of products with no assurance that we will ever recoup these payments 
we also may make equity investments in our strategic partners 
these investments may decline in value and result in our incurring financial statement charges in the future 
if we are unable to timely complete our search for a new chief executive officer and successfully transition to new leadership  our business could be adversely affected 
in november  j 
raymond elliott  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  informed our board of directors that he plans to retire from his positions as president and chief executive officer in the first half of  assuming a successor ceo has been named 
he will remain as chairman through at least november our board of directors  with the assistance of spencer stuart  a global executive recruiting firm  has begun a search for a successor  which includes both internal and external candidates 
we cannot assure you when we will find a suitable candidate for this position and what effect  if any  a new ceo may have on our business and our ability to retain our senior executives and other key scientific  technical  sales  marketing and other personnel 
the loss of the services of such senior executives or key personnel or any general instability in the composition of our senior management team could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business and operating strategies 
once we hire a new ceo  our success will be dependent upon his or her ability to gain proficiency in leading our company  his or her ability to implement or adapt our corporate strategies and initiatives and his or her ability to develop key professional relationships  including relationships with our team members  the independent distributors who market our products  the orthopaedic surgeons who assist and advise us and our key suppliers and other business partners 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 
we use a number of suppliers for raw materials we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities 
these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements 
some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources 
a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future profitability may be affected by changes to our product category and region sales mix 
reconstructive implants produce the highest operating profit margins among our product categories 
these products accounted for approximately percent of net sales 
sales in our americas region accounted for approximately percent of net sales 
sales in the americas region produce the highest operating profit margins in the geographic markets in which we operate 
while we expect net sales of reconstructive implants and net sales in the americas region to remain strong  changes to our product category mix or our region sales mix could adversely affect our future profitability

form k annual report item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
overview we are a global leader in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants  including joint and dental  spinal implants  trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as osp 
we also provide hospital focused consulting services to help member institutions design  implement and manage successful orthopaedic programs of distinction  which account for less than one percent of sales 
reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees  hips  shoulders and elbows 
dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease 
spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases  deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine 
trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body s natural healing process 
osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post operation rehabilitation 
through our consulting services  we provide hospitals and other orthopaedic practices resource capabilities in the areas of business development  marketing  in outpatient rehab practice  clinical pathways  care mapping and space design  community relations  customer service  delivery models  cost accounting  staff utilization and more in order to improve the profit environment 
we have operations in more than countries and market products in more than countries 
we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the americas  europe and asia pacific 
we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is percentage points below the rate of growth from compared to a slowdown in procedure growth at acute care institutions in our largest operating segment as well as first half competitive losses in hips contributed to the slower growth in product sales 
we believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis will continue to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population  obesity  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques such as our mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the continued shift in demand to premium products  such as longevity  durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes  trabecular metal technology products  high flex knees  knee revision products and porous hip stems  continue to positively affect sales growth 
for example  during  sales of products incorporating trabecular metal technology were over million  a year over year increase of over percent 
we believe the most effective way to address rising health care costs without affecting patient access or treatment options is a systemic approach 
this year we acquired hmi which specializes in helping hospitals to improve their business processes 
hmi will be part of a new zimmer business unit specifically focused on health economic issues 
this will include developing new clinical economic data  expanding our current pathways program  and helping to develop improved office management processes and technology 
we believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry 
we continued our significant progress in the development and introduction of mis implants  procedures and technologies 
during the year ended december   the zimmer institute and its satellite locations trained nearly  surgeons on advanced techniques  including over  surgeons on mis procedures 
pricing trends selling prices were up modestly during compared with a percentage point increase during when compared to asia pacific selling prices decreased percentage points for the year ended december   compared to a negligible change in when compared to effective april   the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates  which contributed to a reduction of our selling prices in japan by approximately percent during japan represents approximately percent of our sales 
effective january   the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates again 
we estimate this action will affect japan sales negatively by approximately percent for the americas experienced a percent increase in selling prices during  compared to a percent increase in in europe  selling prices for decreased percent  the same decrease we saw in as compared to within europe  germany  which constitutes approximately percent of our sales  experienced a percent decrease in selling prices in  as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates 
the united kingdom  which comprises percent of our sales  reported a similar percent decline in selling prices for the year 
the price declines in germany and the united kingdom were partially offset by increased selling prices in other european markets 
with continuing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and group purchasing organizations  we

form k annual report estimate global sales could be adversely affected by to percent in due to changes in selling prices 
foreign currency exchange rates for  foreign currency exchange rates had a modest negative effect on global sales growth 
a weaker us dollar compared to most foreign currencies in the three month period ended december   compared to the same period  increased sales by percentage points 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates  we estimate that the weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in of approximately percent on sales 
we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities  and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization  through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to offsetting gains losses on hedge contracts  which are recorded in cost of products sold  the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 
new product sales new products  which we define as products or stock keeping units sku s introduced within the prior month period to a particular market  accounted for percent  or million  of sales 
adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of performance in our industry 
our sales have grown with the introduction of new products  such as the gender solutions knee  durom acetabular system with metasul technology  trabecular metal primary hip prosthesis  versys epoch composite hip stem  acetabular revision system  zimmer ncb plating system  anatomical shoulder inverse reverse systems and zimmer universal locking plates 
we expect new products in our current pipeline will favorably affect our future operating performance 
products we expect to contribute to new product sales in include  in addition to those listed above  an mis porolock stem  durom hemi femoral with metasul technology  porolock titanium surface stem with kinectiv tm technology  natural knee ii high flex gender  nexgen lps high flex mobile bearing knee  dynesys top loading dynamic stabilization and brigit tm bone resection instrument guide 
strategic initiatives enable  innovate and grow our refined corporate strategies now focus on our ability to enable  to innovate  and to grow 
each of these corporate strategies has three initiatives linked with it  in total these initiatives will guide our business plan for the foreseeable future 
we believe these initiatives will enable us to effectively respond to key trends in the orthopaedics industry while continuing to build upon our strengths 
some of these are further discussed below 
we will enable growth by  among other actions  reaching out to new audiences 
historically our focus has been primarily on the surgeon health care provider and the orthopaedic wing of the hospital 
more decision makers are now involved 
these include consumers with specific focus on special consumer groups such as women  the obese  ethnic groups  age specific groups  governments  general practitioners and nurses  insurance companies and other payors  and professional societies 
a direct to patient campaign we are conducting in the united states to support the gender solutions knee product launch  and the back in the groove tm community healthcare program aimed at providing african american arthritis sufferers increased access to information about knee and hip replacement options  are examples of how we can reach out to these new audiences 
we will innovate new and unique solutions for orthopaedic patients 
biologics is the new frontier of orthopaedics with enormous potential to provide new treatment approaches for patients 
we already have a strong foundation in this area 
for example  through an agreement with revivicor  inc we obtained exclusive worldwide distribution rights for genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies  including soft tissue biological repair and replacement 
in partnership with isto technologies  we are developing cartilage regeneration and cell based therapies called neocartilage technology 
we will grow through appropriately planned investment 
infrastructure investments are planned to support future growth which include but are not limited to  the substantial investments we are making to our facilities around the world 
they also include improvements to our organizational infrastructure  such as vertical integration in sourcing  expanded quality systems  information technology efficiency  leading edge compliance  state of the art automation  and advanced education 
acquisitions of centerpulse and implex we are near completion of our integration plans for centerpulse and implex 
we incurred an aggregate of million in acquisition and integration costs and expenses from october through december although the vast majority of the integration activities are behind us  a few items still remain 
some of those items include continued it systems conversions  continued manufacturing in sourcing and some warehouse consolidations in a few countries

r  share based payment sfas r 
we adopted this accounting standard using the modified prospective method and will not restate prior periods 
share based payment expense had the effect of reducing diluted earnings per share by during the year ended december  our share based payment expense is primarily derived from awards of stock options and equity share units 
we did not grant any equity share units until prior to january  under accounting principle board opinion no

all other items of operating cash flows accounted for a use of million of cash pertaining principally to investments in working capital in support of sales growth 
we continue to focus on working capital management 
at december   we had days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable  an increase of days when compared to december  a modest slowdown in payments from health care institutions occurred in all reporting segments 
at december   we had days of inventory on hand  favorable to december  by days 
our inventory levels have improved from a third quarter high of days as a result of seasonal demand patterns and internal efforts to redeploy inventory to eliminate unnecessary safety stocks and improve inventory turns

additions to other property  plant and equipment during were million compared to million in increases were related to facility expansions in warsaw  indiana  ponce  puerto rico  and parsippany  new jersey 
these facility expansions improved working conditions and capabilities for our research and development organization  and responded to increased demand  the transfer of production to our other manufacturing sites as a result of the closure of the austin  texas facility and the tripling of trabecular metal technology production capacity

we expect to use excess cash to fund future purchases  if any  under these programs 
we have a five year  million revolving  multi currency  senior unsecured credit facility maturing march  the senior credit facility 
we had million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december   and an availability of  million 
the million is for use in japan and carries a low interest rate 
the senior credit facility contains a provision by which we can increase the line to  million 
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers  and our wholly 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors  of the senior credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a libor based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility  at an alternate base rate  or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process 
the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement  including  among other things  limitations on consolidations  mergers and sales of assets 
financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of to and a minimum interest coverage ratio of to if we fall below an investment grade credit rating  additional restrictions would result  including restrictions on investments  payment of dividends and stock repurchases 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december  commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees  including a facility and a utilization fee 
the senior credit facility is rated bbb by standard poor s ratings services and is not rated by moody s investors service  inc we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling million 
management believes that cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility  are sufficient to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs 
should investment opportunities arise  we believe that our earnings  balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital  if necessary 
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions and and and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
the amounts established equate to less than of total liabilities and represent management s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
as such  these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
share based payment we account for share based payment expense in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
additionally  we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options 
the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors 
the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management s best estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars and korean won or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through june the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  and  were  million and  million  respectively 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december   were million 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd  usd swiss franc  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar  australian dollar usd and usd korean won we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and korean won  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million  million  million  million and million for the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and korean won contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million at december   primarily in swiss francs  japanese yen and euros 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency translation gains losses recognized in earnings under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation are generally offset with gain losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into to month supply contracts  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
presently  we invest our cash and equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities 
we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of our debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure  but may do so in the future 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on interest expense 
however  because the effects of any method selected to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes are uncertain  this analysis assumes that management will take no action to mitigate interest rate risk 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions  and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments  and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
