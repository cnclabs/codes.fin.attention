item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ameren executive summary operations clearly  will be remembered as an incredibly challenging year for ameren  as well as for the communities served by ue  cips  cilco and ip 
for the better part of the second half of  ameren was focused on addressing the consequences resulting from unprecedented summer and winter storms 
in  ue also continued its extensive restoration efforts associated with the december breach of the upper reservoir at its taum sauk pumped storage  hydroelectric facility and settled related liability matters with federal authorities 
unfortunately  ue did not receive a unified settlement offer from all relevant missouri state authorities 
on february   ue submitted plans and an environmental report to the ferc to rebuild the upper reservoir of the taum sauk plant assuming successful resolution of outstanding issues with authorities of the state of missouri 
because of the likelihood of higher electric rates in illinois following the end of a legislative rate freeze on january   certain illinois legislators  the illinois attorney general  the illinois governor  and other parties sought to block an icc approved auction that occurred in september to procure power for use by the ameren illinois utilities customers beginning in these parties continue to challenge the auction process and the recovery of costs for power supply resulting from the auction through rates to customers 
to mitigate the impact of the electric rate increases on customers  an electric rate increase phase in plan was approved by the icc in december in november  the ameren illinois utilities also received an icc order increasing their electric delivery service rates by an aggregate of million 
this order authorized a return on equity  but was significantly less than the ameren illinois utilities request for approximately a million increase primarily because of the disallowance of significant levels of expenses  which the ameren illinois utilities believe were prudently incurred 
primarily as a result of this order and cost increases since the base year for setting these rates  the return on equity in for the ameren illinois utilities will be meaningfully below the return on equity allowed by the order 
a rehearing was granted on a portion of the disallowed costs 
the necessity and timing of additional electric delivery services rate increase requests in illinois will be influenced by the result of this rehearing  which is expected in may in july  ue filed for its first electric rate increase in almost years 
ue s electric rate filing included a proposed annual increase in electric rates of million 
ue also filed last july for an increase in natural gas delivery rates of million annually 
interveners in the electric rate case have recommended rate reductions 
decisions are expected by the mopsc by june while was full of challenges  we did remain focused on our core operations and were able to achieve several notable accomplishments 
from an operational standpoint  ameren s power plants performed very well in  setting records for generation output 
availability and capacity factors of the missouri regulated coal fired power plants were comparable with solid results  averaging and  respectively 
in  ameren s non rate regulated coal fired plants improved their availability from to year over year and capacity factors from to 
we also successfully executed our plan to hedge most of our estimated available non rate regulated 
table of contents generation due to the expiration of our below market contracts at the end of earnings ameren reported earnings of per share for which compared to earnings of per share last year 
ameren s earnings in included an cent per share charge for the adoption of a new accounting principle related to aros 
earnings in were affected by restoration efforts associated with severe storms that reduced ameren s net income by cents per share 
in addition  costs related to the december breach of the upper reservoir at ue s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility decreased earnings by cents per share 
ameren also incurred a charge of cents per share related to funding commitments for low income energy assistance and energy efficiency programs associated with the december icc order associated with the electric rate increase phase in plan 
incremental gains of approximately cents per share in  associated with the sale of certain non core properties  including leveraged leases  reduced the negative impact of these items 
earnings in were also unfavorably affected by escalating costs for fuel and related transportation  operating materials  and financing costs and depreciation associated with significant energy infrastructure investments in ameren s regulated electric and gas utility businesses 
in addition  earnings were significantly affected by mild summer and winter weather  as well as lower power prices for excess energy sales as compared to market prices for power in were higher than as a result of the significant impact of hurricanes and rail disruptions in operating results in benefited from organic sales growth  improved plant performance  the lack of a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at ue s callaway nuclear plant  illinois electric commercial and industrial customers returning to tariff rates because these rates were below market rates for power  and higher sales levels of emission allowances 
liquidity cash flows from operations of billion in at ameren  along with other funds  were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of million and fund capital expenditures of million and ct acquisitions of million 
financing activities in primarily consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital investment with borrowings under credit facilities 
outlook electric rates in illinois are expected to continue to be a source of debate among legislators and regulators in proposed actions have included freezing rates at levels despite significantly higher purchased power costs for the ameren illinois utilities 
any decision or action that impairs the ability of cips  cilco and ip to fully recover costs from their electric customers in a timely manner would result in material adverse consequences for ameren  cips  cilcorp  cilco  and ip 
cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip expect to take whatever actions are necessary to protect their financial interests  including seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts 
the ultimate resolution of pending electric and gas rate cases in missouri  coupled with a final decision in the rehearing of certain electric delivery service rate case issues in illinois  will have a significant impact on earnings in and ameren s regulated utilities are expected to experience significant increases in the costs of serving their customers  including coal and related transportation costs that are expected to increase by to in and another to in many of these costs will be in excess of those reflected in regulated rates because rates are largely based on historical costs 
ameren expects to realize significantly higher electric margins due to the replacement of below market power sales contracts  which expired in  with higher priced contracts in in the future  ameren also expects to realize lower income associated with the sale of emission allowances and noncore properties than realized in while ameren expects continued economic growth in its service territory to benefit energy demand in and beyond  higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from consumers 
the epa  together with state authorities  is requiring more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants 
between and  ameren expects its subsidiaries will be required to spend between billion and billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment 
approximately half of this investment will be at ue and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers 
the recoverability of amounts invested in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust to reflect this increased investment by the industry 
general ameren  headquartered in st 
louis  missouri  is a public utility holding company under puhca administered by ferc 
ameren was registered with the sec as a public utility holding company under puhca until that act was repealed effective february  ameren s primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries

benefiting operating cash flows were an million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions in compared with  and the collection of higher than normal trade receivables caused by cold december weather during the winter heating season 
the cash impact from trade receivables was more significant in the current period because we had higher gas prices and colder december weather in than in the year ago period 
negative impacts on operating cash flow include a million increase in income tax payments  expenditures of million including a million ferc fine associated with the breach of the taum sauk upper reservoir in december  and million of other operations and maintenance expenses due to severe storms 
most of the taum sauk expenditures are pending recovery from insurance carriers 
in addition  there was an increase in cash used during for payment of costs  including million for other operations and maintenance and million for annual incentive compensation 
these expenses were higher than they were a year ago because of increased earnings relative to performance targets

cash from operating activities increased for cilcorp and cilco in  compared with  primarily because of higher electric margins as discussed in results of operations  and an increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder december weather and higher gas prices than in the year ago period 
in addition  income tax payments decreased million for cilcorp and million for cilco 
an increase in coal deliveries at cilco s subsidiary  aerg  negatively affected cash 
ip s cash from operations increased in  compared with benefiting cash flows was the collection of higher than normal trade receivables caused by cold december weather during the heating season  as discussed above for ameren  and a million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit payments 
these increases were reduced by lower electric margins and higher other operations and maintenance expenses  including million related to severe storms  net income tax refunds of million in compared with million in  and cash used during for payment of costs as discussed above for ameren  including an increase of million in other operations and maintenance expenses  and an increase of million in incentive compensation 
versus ameren s increase in cash from operations in  compared with  was primarily attributable to million of incremental ip operating cash flow in the nine months ended september   since ameren did not own ip during the comparable period in excluding the impact of ip  ameren s increase in electric and gas margins of million and million  respectively  also contributed to the increase in cash from operations 
in addition  decreased pension and other postretirement benefit contributions of million and decreased interest payments of million contributed to the favorable variance in cash from operations 
reducing the positive variance in were increased tax payments of million  the absence in of million of cash from the ue coal contract settlement received in  and an increase in net investment in inventories and trade receivables and payables due to higher gas prices and colder weather in december compared to december the absence in of million of refunds in for previously paid fees to miso and rto start up costs also reduced the positive variance in cash from operations 
ameren s working capital investment in coal inventories as of december   did not change significantly  compared with  as a million ton decrease in volumes due to rail derailments was offset by higher prices 
at ue  cash from operating activities in was generally consistent with changes in its results of operations and its operating cash flows in a million decrease in pension and postretirement contributions benefited operating cash flow as compared with significant items negatively impacting cash in compared with include increased tax payments of million  less cash from electric margins and emissions sales of million  the impact of the coal contract settlement discussed above  the absence of million received in for miso exit fees and rto start up costs discussed above  and increased working capital investment  primarily because of timing differences  prices  and weather as discussed above 
cips increase in cash from operating activities in was principally due to increased electric margins of million  a reduction of million in pension and postretirement benefit contributions  and reduced interest and tax payments 
this was reduced by increases in cash outflows caused by differences in the timing and amount of working capital items  compared with cash from operating activities increased for genco in compared with  primarily because of reduced pension and postretirement contributions of million and lower interest payments of million 
reducing this increase were increased tax payments of million 
cash from operating activities decreased for cilcorp and cilco in compared with  primarily because of increased tax payments of million for cilcorp and million for cilco  lower electric margins of million for cilcorp and million for cilco  and increased working capital investment at cilcorp and cilco  primarily due to higher prices and colder weather  which increased inventories and receivables by million and million for cilcorp and million and million for cilco 

table of contents cilcorp s cash from operating activities was also negatively affected by additional interest payments of million in compared with these decreases were reduced by a decrease in pension and other postretirement contributions of million 
ip s cash from operations in compared with was affected by ameren s ownership of ip for all of compared with only the fourth quarter of ip s operating cash flows in are not directly comparable with s because of the integration of ip into ameren s operations  significant changes in capital structure  termination of certain of ip s former affiliate agreements  and new purchased power arrangements  among other factors 
ip s cash from operations in benefited from lower taxes paid of million  which resulted mostly from changes in taxable income and deferred tax benefits from accelerated depreciation resulting from the acquisition  and lower interest paid of million 
negative impacts to ip s operating cash in included the absence of million of interest received from ip s former affiliate  increased cash required for other operations and maintenance expenses of million  and increased working capital investment 
significant drivers of the increase in working capital investment were colder weather and higher gas prices in december  which increased receivables and gas inventories 
ip s gas sales were up over december pension funding ameren s and contributions to the defined benefit retirement plan s qualified trusts  among other things  provide cost savings  because they mitigate future benefit cost increases 
in addition  the contribution in allowed us to avoid paying a portion of the insurance premium to the pension benefit guaranty trust corporation 
federal interest rate relief expired on december  based on our assumptions at december   and the new contribution requirements in the pension protection act of  in order to maintain minimum funding levels for ameren s pension plans  we do not expect future contributions to be required until at which time we would expect to contribute million to million

cash flows from investing activities versus ameren s increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to ue s purchases of a megawatt ct facility from affiliates of nrg energy  inc  and megawatt and megawatt ct facilities from subsidiaries of aquila  inc  for a total of million  increased nuclear fuel expenditures of million  and million of capital expenditures during related to the severe storms 
the ct purchases are intended to meet ue s increased generating capacity needs and to provide ue with additional flexibility in determining the timing of future base load generating capacity additions 
emission allowance purchases decreased million in compared with  while emission allowance sales increased million 
the sale of noncore properties in provided a million benefit to ameren s cash from investing activities as discussed below in the sale of noncore properties section 
ue s cash used in investing activities decreased in  compared with the same period in  principally because of a decrease in capital expenditures at the callaway nuclear plant 
this is due to ue spending million for planned upgrades during a scheduled refueling outage in in addition  in ue received million from cips as repayment of an intercompany note 
the cash effect of the million in ct purchases discussed above was more than the prior year effect of the million purchase of two cts from genco and the purchase of ct equipment from development company for million 
ue s capital expenditures related to the storms referenced above were million 
in  ue had a million gain on the sale of a noncore property  and a million increase in sales of emission allowances 
cips cash used in investing activities increased in  compared with capital expenditures increased million 
also negatively impacting cips investing cash flow was an million reduction in proceeds from cips note receivable from genco in compared with in addition  cips paid million to repurchase its own outstanding bond 
the bond remains outstanding  and cips is currently the holder and debtor 
the bond is expected to be redeemed in the increased capital expenditures resulted partly from cips expansion of its service territory because of its acquisition of ue s illinois utility operations in may in addition  million was expended as a result of storms 
cips remaining capital expenditures were for projects to improve the reliability of its electric and gas transmission and distribution systems 
genco had a net use of cash in investing activities for  compared with a net source of cash for this was due primarily to the sale of two cts to ue for million 
purchases of emission allowances were million less in than in capital expenditures increased million for compared with cilcorp s cash used in investing activities decreased  and cilco s increased in  compared with capital expenditures increased million for cilcorp and cilco  and net money pool advances decreased for each company by million 
cilcorp s cash from investing activities further benefited from the repayment of resources company s note payable of million that originated from the transfer of leveraged leases from cilcorp to

in addition  a subsidiary of cilcorp and cilco generated cash from investing activities of million in  from the sale of its remaining leveraged lease investments 
emission allowance purchases were million less in than in ip had a net use of cash in investing activities for  compared with a net source of cash for  primarily because of the absence in of proceeds in from repayments for advances made to the money pool in prior periods 
in addition  capital expenditures increased million over the year ago period  which included million as a result of severe storms  and increased expenditures to maintain the reliability of ip s electric and gas transmission and distribution systems 
see note commitments and contingencies to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a further discussion of future environmental capital investment estimates 
intercompany transfer of illinois service territory on may   ue completed the transfer of its illinois based electric and natural gas service territory to cips  at a net book value of million 
ue transferred of the assets directly to cips in consideration for a cips subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of million and of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to ameren  followed by a capital contribution by ameren to cips 
the remaining principal balance of million under the note was repaid in full by cips in june sale of noncore properties in  ameren  ue  cilcorp  and cilco generated proceeds totaling million million  million million  million million  and million million  respectively  from the sale of certain noncore properties  including leveraged leases 
prior to the leveraged lease sale  cilcorp transferred certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries that hold leveraged leases to resources company and aerg in exchange for a note receivable

versus ameren had a decrease in cash used in investing activities  primarily because of million used to acquire ip in that decrease was partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures reflecting a full year of ip capital expenditures in compared with three months of ip expenditures in  and the increased capital expenditures at ue discussed below 
ue s cash used in investing activities increased in  primarily because ue spent million to purchase megawatts of cts from genco and million to purchase ct equipment from development company 
excluding these ct acquisitions  ue s capital expenditures in were consistent with those in ue maintained consistent plant expenditures by allocating fewer resources to projects at its coal fired plants as it spent million of expenditures at its callaway nuclear plant for upgrades during a refueling and maintenance outage 
cips had a net use of cash in compared with net cash proceeds from investing activities in  primarily because of an million increase in capital expenditures and a million reduction in cash received from principal payments on a note receivable from genco 
the increased capital expenditures were used to improve the reliability of cips transmission and distribution systems 
genco had a net source of cash in  compared with a net use of cash from investing activities in  primarily because of the sale of megawatts of cts at pinckneyville and kinmundy  illinois  to ue for million 
the benefit of these proceeds was reduced by increased capital expenditures for upgrades at one of its power plants in and by an increase in emission allowance purchases of million 
cilcorp s and cilco s cash used in investing activities decreased in from  primarily because cilcorp and cilco reduced capital expenditures and received proceeds of million in from the sale of leveraged leases 
in  cilco s subsidiary  aerg  made capital expenditures for significant power plant upgrades to increase fuel supply flexibility for power generation 
the purchase of emission allowances negatively affected cash by million more in than in ip had net proceeds of cash in and a net use of cash in  primarily because of proceeds of million for repayments of advances made to the money pool by ip in capital expenditures the following table presents the capital expenditures by the ameren companies for the years ended december    and capital expenditures ameren a ue cips genco cilcorp cilco illinois regulated cilco aerg ip b a excludes amounts for ip before the acquisition date of september   includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations

cips and ip incurred storm damage related expenditures of million and million  respectively 
at genco and aerg there was a cash outlay of million and million  respectively  for scrubber projects 
the scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations 
genco also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade of million 
other capital expenditures were principally to maintain  upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of ue  cips  cilco  and ip 
ameren s and ue s capital expenditures for principally consisted of million for steam generators  low pressure rotor replacements  and other upgrades during the refueling and maintenance outage at ue s callaway nuclear plant

cilcorp s and cilco s capital expenditures included million for ongoing generation plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation 
in addition  cilco  cips  and ip incurred expenditures to maintain  upgrade and expand the reliability of their electric and gas transmission and distribution systems 
ameren s capital expenditures for were made principally for various upgrades at ue s power plants  including the replacement of condenser bundles  and other upgrades during the refueling and maintenance outage at ue s callaway nuclear plant 
the replacement and upgrade work at ue s callaway plant resulted in capital expenditures of million in in addition  ue incurred costs for steam generators and low pressure rotors that were replaced during the refueling and maintenance outage at the callaway nuclear plant 
ue also incurred capital expenditures related to the installation of new cts at its venice plant and replacement of turbines at two of its power plants in in addition  ue s capital expenditures included environmental and other upgrades at its power plants and expenditures for new transmission and distribution lines 
cilcorp s and cilco s capital expenditures in were primarily related to power plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation 
genco s capital expenditures were primarily attributed to the replacement of a turbine generator at one of its power plants 
capital expenditures at ip and cips consisted of numerous projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of their respective electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and to add new customers to the systems 
the following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the ameren companies from through  including construction expenditures  capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction except for genco  which has no allowance for funds used during construction  and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards total ue cips genco cilco illinois regulated cilco aerg ip eei other ameren a a includes amounts for nonregistrant ameren subsidiaries 
ue s estimated capital expenditures include transmission  distribution and generation related activities  as well as expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations discussed below 
cips  cilco s  and ip s estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and distribution related activities 
genco s estimated capital expenditures are primarily for upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities and compliance with new environmental regulations 
cilco aerg s estimate includes capital expenditures for generation related activities  as well as for compliance with new environmental regulations at aerg s generating facilities 
we continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs 
as a result  we could modify our plan for generation capacity  which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio  the type of generation asset technology that will be employed  and whether capacity or power may be purchased  among other things 
any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred  which could be material 
environmental capital expenditures ameren  ue  genco  aerg and eei will incur significant costs in future years to comply with epa and state regulations regarding so and noxemissions the clean air interstate rule and mercury emissions the clean air mercury rule from coal fired power plants 
the epa issued final so  so  and mercury emission regulations in may the rules require significant reductions in these emissions from ue  genco  aerg and eei power plants in phases  beginning in states were mandated to develop their own regulations as well 
in february  the missouri air conservation commission approved the proposed federal clean air mercury and clean air interstate rules  which substantially follow the federal rules 
in december  the illinois pollution control board adopted the mercury regulations  which are significantly stricter than the federal rules 
illinois has proposed rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule program  
table of contents however it is anticipated that the rules will not be finalized until the second quarter of the table below presents estimated capital costs based on current technology to comply with both the federal clean air interstate rule and clean air mercury rule through  and illinois mercury regulations pursuant to an agreement between genco  cilco  eei  and the illinois epa 
under the agreement  genco  cilco and eei may delay the compliance date for mercury reductions in exchange for accelerated installation of nox and nox controls 
the agreement with the illinois epa also restricts purchasing so and nox emission allowances to meet specific allowed emission rates set forth in the agreement 
the estimates described below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements  new technology  variations in costs of material or labor or alternative compliance strategies  among other reasons 
the timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with the proposed rules  thereby deferring capital investment 
total ue a genco aerg eei ameren a ue s expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time 
illinois and missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet the federal eight hour ozone ambient standard by june and the federal fine particulate ambient standard by april the costs in the table assume that emission controls required for the clean air interstate rule regulations will be sufficient to meet this new standard in the st 
louis region 
should missouri develop an alternative plan to comply with this standard  the cost impact could be material to ue 
illinois is planning to impose additional requirements beyond the clean air interstate rule as part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine particulate 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact state actions would have on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

cash flows from financing activities versus ameren had a net source of cash from financing activities in  compared with a net use of cash in positive effects on cash included a net increase of million in net short term debt proceeds in  compared with net repayments of million of short term debt in and a million decrease in long term debt redemptions  repurchases and maturities 
negative effects on cash included a million reduction in long term debt proceeds from the year ago period  and a million reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the reduction in common stock proceeds was due to the issuance of million shares in the period related to the settlement of a stock purchase obligation in ameren s adjustable conversion rate equity security units 
ue had a net use of cash used in financing activities in  compared with a net source of cash in the absence of long term debt issuances in  compared with million of long term debt issuances in  was the primary reason for the change  but this negative effect on cash flow was reduced by net changes in short term debt that resulted in a million positive effect on cash in  compared with a million negative effect on cash in in addition  dividend payments decreased million in the period from  and net money pool borrowings increased million 
cash from financing activities in was used principally to fund ct acquisitions 
cips cash used in financing activities decreased in  compared with  principally because of the issuance of million of long term debt that was used with other available corporate funds to repay cips outstanding balance on the intercompany note payable to ue 
that note was originally issued as of the consideration for ue s illinois service territory  which was transferred to cips in cash was also positively affected by a million net decrease in money pool repayments and borrowings of million under the million credit facility in a million increase in dividends to ameren negatively affected cips cash from financing activities in  compared with the year ago period 
genco had a net decrease in cash used in financing activities for  compared with  principally because of million of capital contributions received in from ameren 
these capital contributions were made to reduce genco s money pool borrowings 
in  genco used the million from the sale of cts to ue along with other funds to retire million of maturing debt and to make principal payments on intercompany notes with cips and ameren 
reducing these positive effects on cash was a million increase in dividend payments in the period compared with the period 
cilcorp had a net use of cash in  compared with a net source of cash in cilco s cash provided by financing activities decreased in  compared with net money pool repayments increased million at cilcorp and million at cilco

in  cilcorp used cash of million for redemptions  repurchases and maturities of long term debt  compared with million in the period 
cilco s cash used for redemptions  repurchases and maturities of long term debt was comparable in the two years 
these positive effects on cash in were partially offset by the absence in of a million capital contribution received in from ameren  which was made to reduce cilco s short term debt 
also contributing to cilcorp s and cilco s increase in cash used in financing activities for  compared with  were increased common stock dividends of million at cilcorp and million at cilco 
ip had a net source of cash from financing activities in  compared with a net use of cash in this was partly because of lower redemptions and repurchases of long term debt of million 
more debt was repaid in to improve ip s credit profile 
other positive effects on cash from financing activities included the absence in of million of common stock dividend payments made in  net borrowings of million on the million credit facility  and the issuance of million of long term debt in compared with no long term debt proceeds in the million was used to reduce money pool borrowings 
versus ameren had a net use of cash used for financing activities in  compared with a net source of cash in  primarily because of a billion decrease in proceeds from common stock issuances in compared with the common stock proceeds in were principally used to fund the acquisition of ip and dynegy s interest in eei on september   and to repurchase and redeem certain ip indebtedness subsequent to the acquisition 
in  total common stock proceeds of million included million from the issuance of million shares of common stock related to the settlement of a stock purchase obligation in ameren s adjustable conversion rate equity security units 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was also attributable to million of net redemptions of short term debt  compared with net proceeds of million in decreased long term debt redemptions of million  increased long term debt issuances of million  and the absence in of a million ue nuclear fuel lease payment in partially offset the decrease in cash from financing activities in ue cash provided by financing activities increased in  compared with  primarily because of a million decrease in long term debt redemptions  a million increase in issuances of long term debt  a million decrease in the payment of dividends to ameren  and the absence of a million nuclear fuel lease payment that was made in these benefits in cash from financing activities were partially offset by million used for short term debt repayments  in  ue had net proceeds from short term debt 
cips cash used in financing activities decreased in from  primarily because of a million cash increase from reduced dividends paid to ameren  and decreased long term debt redemptions of million 
these positive effects on cash were partially offset by decreased issuances of long term debt of million and net repayments of utility money pool borrowings of million 
genco s cash used in financing activities increased in from  primarily because of a million long term debt redemption in and increased payments of million on its note payable to ameren 
the funds for these repayments came from the million in proceeds from the sale of megawatts of cts to ue 
net cash used in financing activities also increased because of a capital contribution decrease of million 
a reduction of million in payments on a note payable to cips and a net increase in non state regulated subsidiary money pool borrowings of million  partially offset the additional uses of cash 
effective may   genco and cips amended certain terms of genco s subordinated affiliate note payable to cips by issuing to cips an amended and restated subordinated promissory note for million with an interest rate of per year  a five year amortization schedule  and a maturity of may  cilcorp and cilco had a net source of cash in financing activities in  compared with a net use of cash in for cilcorp  an million increase in proceeds from an intercompany note payable to ameren and from decreased long term debt redemptions of million benefited cash 
reducing these increases were an increase in net repayments of money pool borrowings of million and lower long term debt issuances of million 
cilco s increase in cash from financing activities was mainly due to decreased long term debt redemptions of million and increased capital contributions from ameren of million 
reducing these increases were increased net repayments of utility money pool borrowings of million and increased dividend payments of million 
ip had a net use of cash in investing activities in  compared with a net source of cash in  primarily because included an million capital contribution from ameren 
ip s million increase in dividends to ameren also contributed to ip s increase in cash used in financing activities 
these negative effects on cash were reduced by lower redemptions and repurchases of long term debt of million and by million of cash received from utility money pool borrowings

we consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows 
inability to raise capital on favorable terms  particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets  could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses 
after assessing our current operating performance  liquidity  and credit ratings see credit ratings below  we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets 
however  events beyond our control  such as the legislation proposed to freeze electric rates at levels in illinois for cips  cilco and ip  may create

the board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends 
however  the board considers various issues  including ameren s historical earnings and cash flow  projected earnings  projected cash flow and potential cash flow requirements  dividend payout rates at other utilities  return on investments with similar risk characteristics  and overall business considerations 
on february   ameren s board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of cents per share payable on march   to shareholders of record on march  certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that  among other things  restrict the ameren companies payment of dividends 
ue would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures 
cips articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus 
genco s indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold 
cilcorp has common and preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met  or if cilcorp s senior long term debt does not have the ratings described in its indenture 
cilco has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its series preferred stock 
at december   except as described below with respect to the million credit facility  none of these conditions existed at the ameren companies 
as a result  they were allowed to pay dividends 
the restrictions on the ability of ip to declare and pay dividends on its common stock that were established by the icc order approving ameren s acquisition of ip terminated in december with ip s redemption of the remaining  of its series mortgage bonds due this icc order also requires ip to establish a dividend policy comparable to that of ameren s other illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between and 
on july   cips  cilcorp  cilco  ip  and aerg entered into a million multiyear  senior secured credit facility the million credit facility 
this facility limits cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip to common and preferred stock dividend payments of million per year each if cips  cilco s or ip s senior secured long term debt securities or first mortgage bonds  or cilcorp s senior unsecured long term debt securities  get a below investment grade credit rating from either moody s or s p 
with respect to aerg  which currently is not rated by moody s or s p  the common and preferred stock dividend restriction will not apply if its consolidated total debt to consolidated operating cash flow ratio  pursuant to a calculation defined in the facilities  is less than or equal to to on july   moody s downgraded cilcorp s senior unsecured credit rating to below investment grade  causing it to be subject to this dividend payment limitation 
as of december   aerg failed to meet the debt to operating cash flow ratio test in the million credit facility 
aerg therefore is currently limited in its ability to pay dividends to a maximum of million per fiscal year 
the other borrowers are not currently limited in their dividend payments by this provision of the million credit facility

credit ratings the following table presents the principal credit ratings of the ameren companies by moody s  s p and fitch effective on the date of this report moody s s p fitch ameren issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb a unsecured debt baa bbb a commercial paper p a f ue secured debt a bbb a commercial paper p a f 
table of contents moody s s p fitch cips secured debt baa bbb a genco unsecured debt baa bbb bbb cilcorp unsecured debt ba bb bbb cilco secured debt baa bbb a ip secured debt baa bbb bbb on october   moody s placed the long term credit ratings of ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilcorp  cilco and ip under review for possible downgrade  and affirmed the commercial paper ratings of ameren and ue 
moody s had removed the review for possible downgrade in july according to moody s  the review for possible downgrade was reinstituted because of concerns that the timely recovery of increased utility costs could be impaired by legislative action in illinois  specifically the rate freeze legislation discussed in note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report 
moody s stated that enactment of the rate freeze legislation in illinois would be expected to result in a multi notch downgrade of the ratings of cips  cilco and ip to speculative sub investment grade  reflecting the severe impact such action would have on the utilities cash flow and liquidity 
moody s has also indicated that if legislation freezing rates at levels  or similar legislation that restricts the recovery of costs in a timely manner  becomes a substantial possibility  it may consider additional credit ratings downgrades with regard to one or more of the ameren companies 
on october   fitch placed the credit ratings of ameren  cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip on rating watch negative 
the ratings of ue and genco were affirmed and not affected by these rating actions 
the negative rating watch resulted from the heightened political rhetoric surrounding future utility rates in illinois and uncertainty related to recovery of cips  cilcorp s  cilco s and ip s purchased power costs 
on october   s p  in reaction to the intensified political discussion in illinois regarding possible legislation freezing rates at levels  downgraded the credit ratings of the ameren companies 
as a result of s p s downgrade of ameren s and ue s short term ratings to a  ameren and ue are currently limited in their access to the commercial paper market 
all of the s p credit ratings for the ameren companies remain on credit watch with negative implications 
according to s p  it will continue to lower the ameren companies credit ratings if  in its opinion  the likelihood of illinois legislation freezing electric rates at levels increases 
if the legislation is passed  s p will lower ratings on cips  cilco  cilcorp and ip to b a deep junk or speculative credit rating category 
any adverse change in the ameren companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital 
it may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel  power and gas supply  among other things  resulting in a negative impact on earnings 
for example  if at december   the ameren companies had a sub investment grade rating less than bbb or baa  ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilcorp  cilco or ip could have been required to post collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to million  million  million  million  million  million  or million  respectively 
in addition  the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower 
suppliers may request prepayment for products and services 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
it should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization 
outlook below are some key trends that may affect the ameren companies financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity in and beyond 
revenues in  electric rate freezes or adjustment moratoriums and power supply contracts expired in ameren s regulatory jurisdictions 
at the end of  electric rates for ameren s operating subsidiaries had been fixed or declining for periods ranging from years to years 
in january  the icc approved a framework for cips  cilco and ip to procure power for use by their customers through an auction 
it also approved the related tariffs to collect these costs from customers for the period commencing january  this approval is subject to pending court appeals 
in september  the power procurement auction was held and declared successful with respect to power for fixed price customers  the vast majority of electric customers of cips  cilco and ip 
the auction clearing price was about per megawatthour for the fixed price residential and small commercial product and about per megawatthour for large commercial and industrial customers 
marketing company participated in the auction with power being acquired from genco and aerg  subject to an auction rules limitation of providing no more than of the ameren illinois utilities expected annual load  and it was awarded sales in the auction 
as a result of the high auction price for the large commercial and industrial customers  almost all of these customers chose a different supplier 
in  the non rate regulated generation segment generated million megawatthours of power genco million  aerg million  eei million 
power previously supplied by genco to cips and by aerg to cilco was subject to below market priced contracts that expired on december  all but million megawatthours of genco s pre wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements also expired during about million megawatthours of these 
table of contents contracts expire by the end of and another million expire by the end of substantially all of these contracts involved below market prices 
these agreements had an average embedded selling price of per megawatthour 
in  genco also sold million net megawatthours of power in the interchange market at an average market price of per megawatthour 
in  aerg s power was sold principally to cilco  at an average price of per megawatthour 
in addition  aerg sold million net megawatthours of power in the interchange market at an average price of per megawatthour in the non rate regulated generation segment expects to generate million megawatthours of power in genco million  aerg million  eei million 
genco  aerg and eei have contracts to sell all their power to marketing company 
marketing company will resell this power and provide the net proceeds to genco and aerg 
the marketing strategy for non rate regulated generation is to optimize our generation output in a low risk manner to minimize earnings and cash flows volatility  while capitalizing on our low cost generation fleet to provide for solid  sustainable returns 
through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts  and the illinois power procurement auction  non rate regulated generation has sold approximately of its expected generation output million megawatthours at an average price of per megawatthour 
expected sales in include an estimated million megawatthours of power sold through the illinois power procurement auction at about per megawatthour million  million 
including auction sales  approximately of the expected generation output in is sold 
cips  cilco and ip filed rate cases with the icc in december to modify their electric delivery service rates effective january  cips  cilco and ip requested to increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service by million in the aggregate cips million  cilco million and ip million 
in november  the icc issued an order approving an annual revenue increase for electric delivery service of million in the aggregate cips million decrease  cilco million increase and ip million increase based on an allowed return on equity of 
in december  the icc granted the ameren illinois utilities petition for rehearing of the november order on the recovery of certain administrative and general expenses  totaling approximately million  that were disallowed 
because of the icc s cost disallowances and regulatory lag  the ameren illinois utilities are not expected to earn their allowed return on equity in prior to january   most customers were taking service under a frozen bundled electric rate in  which included the cost of power  so any delivery service revenue changes will not directly correspond to a change in cips  cilco s or ip s revenues or earnings under the new electric delivery service rates 
the necessity and timing of new illinois delivery service rate cases for the ameren illinois utilities will be driven by several factors  including the results of the pending rehearing 
average residential electric rates for cips  cilco and ip increased significantly following the expiration of a rate freeze at the end of electric rates rose because of the increased cost of power purchased on behalf of ameren illinois utilities customers based on the results of the illinois power procurement auction held in early september and increases resulting from the delivery service rate cases 
cips and ip average residential rates are expected to increase in by approximately over rates  and cilco average residential rates are expected to increase approximately over rates 
due to the magnitude of these increases  certain illinois legislators  the illinois attorney general  the illinois governor and other parties sought to block the power procurement auction 
they continue to challenge the auction and the structure for the recovery of costs for power supply resulting from the auction through rates to customers 
cips  cilco and ip have received favorable rulings from the icc and the circuit court of cook county  illinois on opposition claims filed by the illinois attorney general  cub and elpc 
these rulings are currently under court appeals 
on october   speaker of the illinois house of representatives michael madigan sent a letter to illinois governor rod blagojevich asking the illinois governor to call a special session of the illinois general assembly to consider legislation to freeze electric rates at levels 
the governor sent a letter indicating that once the votes to pass the legislation were in place  he would immediately call for a special session of the legislature 
the governor s letter further provided that if a consensus among members of the general assembly could not be reached in the near future  he would call a special session in that event as well 
no special session was called 
the governor s letter stated that he continued to support legislation extending a rate freeze and would like to sign it into law as soon as possible 
during the illinois general assembly s session that ended in january  the illinois house of representatives passed legislation to freeze electric rates through  and the illinois senate passed legislation containing a rate increase phase in plan 
the illinois senate bill provided for a mandatory phase in of the increase in residential rates over a three year period 
neither piece of legislation was passed by the other chamber before the session ended in early january any legislative measure will need to be approved by the illinois house of representatives and illinois senate  and signed by the governor before it can become law 
a new illinois general assembly went into session in late january as a result  all previous bills expired 
new bills have been introduced during the current legislative session  including legislation to rollback rates to levels similar to previously proposed legislation 

table of contents cips  cilco and ip believe that legislation freezing electric rates at levels  if enacted  would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position  and liquidity  including the financial insolvency of cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip 
they believe it could cause significant job losses and  without governmental intervention  significant disruptions in electric and gas service 
ameren s illinois utilities own no generation  so the companies must purchase power on the competitive market to meet their customers energy needs 
if electric rates were frozen at levels  the major credit rating agencies have stated that the ameren illinois utilities credit ratings would be downgraded to deep junk or speculative status 
such a downgrade of cilco s ratings would also result in a similar downgrade of cilcorp s ratings 
with such credit ratings  cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip would be faced with potential collateral and prepayment requirements for products and services  such as natural gas  and would run out of cash and available credit and be unable to borrow 
we believe this would cause the ameren illinois utilities to become financially insolvent 
any decision or action that impairs the ability of cips  cilco  and ip to fully recover costs from their electric customers in a timely manner would result in material adverse consequences for ameren  cips  cilcorp  cilco  and ip 
cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip expect to take whatever actions are necessary to protect their financial interests  including seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts 
in december  the icc approved a constructive electric rate increase phase in plan proposed by the ameren illinois utilities for residential customers  eligible schools  local governments and small commercial customers  to address the significant increases in customer rates for the ameren illinois utilities beginning in this optional plan limits annual rate increases to in   and  with amounts in excess of the cap and a carrying cost allowed to be collected over a three year period beginning in this below market carrying cost charge will result in increased net borrowing and financing costs for the ameren illinois utilities 
on february   the ameren illinois utilities announced that they intended to file an electric rate increase mitigation plan with the icc 
as part of the plan  which is subject to icc approval  the ameren illinois utilities would fund an approximate million one time reduction to active residential accounts that would appear on electric bills in march and april the rate mitigation plan is targeted to customers with high volume usage 
as part of the filing  the carrying charge of in the current icc approved phase in plan would be eliminated 
if approved by the icc  the one time credit for residential customers would result in a charge to ameren s earnings in of million  or cents per share 
in addition  eliminating the below market interest rate on deferred amounts under the phase in plan would increase financing costs for the ameren illinois utilities during the deferral period 
the actual cost to ameren will depend on the level of participation in the phase in plan 
see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a further discussion of illinois rate matters 
the illinois general assembly and the icc may consider changes to the illinois power procurement process in the future 
the next illinois power procurement auction for the ameren illinois utilities is scheduled to take place in january in july  ue filed requests with the mopsc for an increase in electric rates of million and in natural gas delivery rates of million 
the mopsc staff recommended in their testimony an electric rate reduction of million to million and a gas rate increase of million to million 
other stakeholders also made recommendations 
a decision from the mopsc is expected no later than june see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a further discussion of missouri rate matters 
we expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit energy demand in and beyond  but higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from consumers  especially in illinois 
ue  genco and cilco are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants through greater investments and a process improvement program and investment 
very volatile power prices in the midwest affect the amount of revenues ameren  ue  genco and cilco through aerg can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and interchange markets and influence the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets 
these companies hedged approximately of estimated available generation  
fuel and purchased power in  of ameren s electric generation ue  genco  cilco was supplied by its coal fired power plants 
about of the coal used by these plants ue  genco  cilco was delivered by railroads from the powder river basin in wyoming 
in  deliveries from the powder river basin were restricted due to derailments 
as of december   coal inventories for ue  genco and aerg were adequate  and consistent with historical levels 
however  inventories and deliveries were still below desired levels because of railroad capacity limitations 
disruptions in coal deliveries could cause ue  genco and cilco to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods  buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity  and purchasing power from other sources 
ameren s coal and related transportation costs are expected to increase to in and to in ameren s nuclear fuel costs are also expected to rise over the next few years 
in  nuclear fuel costs are expected to increase to

in addition  power generation from higher cost gas fired plants is expected to increase in the next few years 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report for information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for through in illinois  ameren and ip will also experience higher year over year purchased power expenses as the amortization of certain favorable purchase accounting adjustments associated with the ip acquisition was completed in in july  a new law was enacted that enables the mopsc to put in place fuel  purchased power  and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for missouri s utilities 
the law also includes rate case filing requirements  a annual rate increase cap for the environmental cost recovery mechanism  and prudency reviews  among other things 
rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the mopsc in september we are unable to predict when rules implementing the environmental cost recovery mechanism will be formally proposed and adopted 
ue requested a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its electric rate case filed with the mopsc in july the mopsc staff and intervenors in the electric rate case have recommended that ue not be granted the right to use such a mechanism 
ue also requested an environmental cost recovery mechanism as part of its pending missouri electric case  but no rules have been established for such a mechanism 
ue s requests are subject to approval by the mopsc 
in  ameren expects to reduce levels of emission allowance sales in order to retain remaining allowances for future environmental compliance needs 
other costs in december  there was a breach of the upper reservoir at ue s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility 
this resulted in significant flooding in the local area  which damaged a state park 
until reviews conducted by state authorities have concluded  litigation has been resolved  the insurance review is completed  a final decision about whether the plant will be rebuilt is made  and future regulatory treatment for the plant is determined  taum sauk will remain out of service 
in february  ue submitted plans and an environmental report to ferc to rebuild the upper reservoir at its taum sauk plant  assuming successful resolution of outstanding issues with authorities of the state of missouri 
should the decision be made to rebuild the taum sauk plant  ue would expect it to be out of service through at least the middle of  if not longer 
ue has accepted responsibility for the effects of the incident 
at this time  ue believes that substantially all of the damage and liabilities but not penalties caused by the breach  including rebuilding the plant  will be covered by insurance 
ue expects the total cost for clean up  damage and liabilities  excluding costs to rebuild the facility  resulting from the taum sauk incident to range from million to million 
as of december   ue had paid million and accrued a million liability  including costs resulting from the ferc stipulation and consent agreement  while expensing million  and recording a million receivable due from insurance companies 
as of december   ue had received million from insurance companies reducing the insurance receivable to million 
as of december   ue had a million receivable due from insurance companies related to rebuilding the facility 
under ue s insurance policies  all claims by or against ue are subject to review by its insurance carriers 
as a result of this breach  ue is subject to litigation by private parties and by state authorities 
we are unable to determine the impact the breach may have on ameren s and ue s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity beyond those amounts already recognized 
ue s callaway nuclear plant s next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in is expected to last to days 
during an outage  which occurs every months  maintenance and purchased power costs increase  and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases  versus non outage years 
over the next few years  we except rising employee benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures we have taken  or may need to take  at ue s callaway nuclear plant and at our other facilities 
insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the taum sauk incident  among other things 
bad debts may increase due to rising electric rates 
we are currently undertaking cost reduction and control initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of all aspects of our business 
capital expenditures the epa has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants 
between and  ameren expects that certain ameren companies will be required to invest between billion and billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment 
these investments will also result in significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment will be in ameren s regulated ue operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers 
the recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of this increased investment 
ameren will provide a report on how it is responding to rising regulatory  competitive  and public pressure to significantly reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions from current and proposed power plant operations 
the report will include ameren s climate change strategy and activities  current greenhouse gas emissions  and analysis with respect to plausible future greenhouse gas 
table of contents scenarios 
ameren will publish this report on its web site by september  investments to control carbon emissions at ameren s coal fired plants would significantly increase future capital expenditures 
ue continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity 
at this time  ue does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until at least however  due to the significant time required to plan  acquire permits for and build a baseload power plant  ue is actively studying future plant alternatives  including those that would use coal or nuclear power 
over the next few years  we expect to make significant investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve overall system reliability in addition to addressing environmental compliance requirements 
we are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures 
other severe storms in and early resulted in electric outages for more than million customers and an increased focus on alternatives for improving reliability during severe storms 
ue s  cips  cilco s and ip s performance during these storms is subject to regulatory and legislative review and media attention 
recommendations to improve service during severe storms resulting from regulatory and internal reviews could include more aggressive tree removal and trimming programs  comprehensive pole and line inspections and burial of more electric services  among other things 
any additional costs or investments would be expected to be recovered in rates 
in  ameren realized gains on sales of noncore properties  including leveraged leases 
the net benefit of these sales to ameren in was cents per share 
ameren continues to pursue the sale of its interests in its remaining three leveraged lease assets 
ameren does not expect to achieve similar sales levels of noncore properties in affiliate transactions as a result of the termination of the jda on december   ue and genco no longer have the obligation to provide power to each other 
ue will be able to sell any excess power it has at market prices  which we believe will most likely be higher than it was paid by genco 
genco will no longer receive the margins on sales that it made  which were fulfilled with power from ue 
ameren s and ue s earnings will be affected by the termination of the jda when ue s rates are adjusted by the mopsc 
ue s requested electric rate increase filed in july is net of the decrease in its revenue requirement from increased margins expected to result from the termination of the jda 
see note rate and regulatory matters and note related party transactions to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for a discussion of the effects of terminating the jda 
the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
these strategies may include acquisitions  divestitures  opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues  and other strategic initiatives to increase ameren s shareholder value 
we are unable to predict which  if any  of these initiatives will be executed

our missouri retail electric rates and gas delivery rates were set through june   as part of the settlement of missouri electric and gas rate cases 
in july  ue filed a request with the mopsc for an increase in base rates for electric service and in natural gas delivery rates 
a decision from the mopsc is expected no later than june our illinois electric rates were legislatively fixed through january  even without these rate moratoriums  adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period 
as a result  revenue increases will lag behind changing prices 
inflation affects our operations  earnings  stockholders equity  and financial performance 

table of contents the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost 
under existing regulatory practice  only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers 
as a result  cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years 
the generation portion of our business in illinois is non rate regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms 
in ue s missouri electric utility jurisdiction  there is currently no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power 
however  in july  a new law was enacted that enables the mopsc to put in place fuel  purchased power  and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for missouri s utilities 
rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the mopsc in september ue requested a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its electric rate case filed with the mopsc in july ue also requested an environmental cost recovery mechanism as part of its pending missouri electric case  but rules have not been established for such a mechanism

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument  derivative or nonderivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates  commodity prices and equity security prices 
a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on  or derived from  the value of some underlying asset 
the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we handle market risks in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks  principally business  legal and operational risks  are not part of the following discussion 
our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters 
our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee  which is composed of senior level ameren officers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with long term and short term variable rate debt  fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and auction rate long term debt 
we manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by on variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest expense net income a ameren ue cips b genco cilcorp cilco ip a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b less than million 
the estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
nymex traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the nymex and have nominal credit risk 
in all other transactions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction 
our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and 
table of contents executory contracts with market risk exposures 
the risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base 
at december   no nonaffiliated customer represented more than  in the aggregate  of our accounts receivable 
our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in missouri and illinois 
ue  cips  genco  aerg  ip  afs and marketing company may have credit exposure associated with interchange purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies 
at december   ue s  cips  genco s  aerg s  ip s  afs and marketing company s combined credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties related to interchange purchases and sales was less than million  net of collateral million 
we establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management  master trading and netting agreements  and credit support  such as letters of credit and parental guarantees 
we also analyze each counterparty s financial condition before we enter into sales  forwards  swaps  futures or option contracts  and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases 
we estimate our credit exposure to miso associated with the miso day two energy market to be million at december  million 
equity price risk our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  including the rate of return on plan assets 
ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in erisa 
ameren s goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk 
ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class 
where appropriate  ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types 
ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines 
the expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio 
assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience  future expectations  and the volatility of the various asset classes 
after considering the target asset allocation for each asset class  we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets 
in future years  the costs of such plans reflected in net income or oci and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially  without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 
ue also maintains a trust fund  as required by the nrc and missouri law  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities and debt securities and totaled million million 
by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  ue seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
the fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ue actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options 
ue s exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated  because ue is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs  which would include unfavorable investment results  through electric rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity  fuel  and natural gas 
ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements 
genco  aerg and eei also seek to sell power forward to wholesale  municipal and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices 
we also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk management programs and policies  which include structured forward hedging programs  and the use of derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts  and financial swap contracts 
however  a portion of the generation capacity of ue  genco  aerg and eei is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices 
similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel exposures for generation 
most ue  genco and aerg fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts 
ue  genco and aerg do not have a provision similar to the pga clause for electric operations  so ue  genco and aerg have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel to manage their exposure to fuel prices 
the coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility 
price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures  whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year 
we generally purchase coal up to five years in advance  but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions 
the strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions 
as part of its pending electric 
table of contents rate case filed in july  ue has requested approval by the mopsc for a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism to its tariffs 
transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs 
we typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility 
the natural gas transportation expenses for the distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units are controlled by ferc via published tariffs with rights to extend the contracts from year to year 
depending on our competitive position  we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our requirements 
the following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period through coal transportation fuel net fuel net expense income a expense income a ameren b ue genco cilcorp cilco eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries 
in the event of a significant change in coal prices  ue  genco and cilco would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources 
with regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel  ue has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements  or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge 
fuel assemblies for the spring refueling are already at the callaway nuclear plant 
ue has price hedges for of the to nuclear fuel requirements 
the nuclear fuel markets have undergone significant change  from a buyer s market to a seller s market with increased potential for supply disruptions 
ue has increased its desired inventories of nuclear fuel with inherent price hedge and has increased its forward contract coverage 
new long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor 
new long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component 
therefore  nuclear fuel price increases are expected and price hedging becomes less available 
ue expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the callaway nuclear plant  at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted 
unlike the electricity and natural gas markets  nuclear fuel markets have no sophisticated financial instruments available for price hedging  so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts  if available 
with regard to the electric generating operations for ue  genco and aerg that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run the cts  the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs 
we optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins 
through the market allocation process  ue  cips  genco  cilco and ip have been granted ftrs associated with the advent of the miso day two energy market 
marketing company has acquired ftrs for its participation in the pjm northern illinois market 
the ftrs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity business 
depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid  ftrs could result in either charges or credits 
we use complex grid modeling tools to determine which ftrs we wish to nominate in the ftr allocation process 
there is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of ftrs we will need  and there is the potential that the ftrs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges 
with regard to ue s natural gas distribution business and cips  cilco s and ip s power and natural gas distribution businesses  exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place 
these cost recovery mechanisms allow ue  cips  cilco and ip to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs 
our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers 
we cannot eliminate the effects of price volatility 
however  procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier  as well as the management of physical assets 
with regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities  ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability

fair value of contracts most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
we use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas  fuel  electricity and emission allowances 

table of contents price fluctuations in natural gas  fuel and electricity may cause any of these conditions an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices  market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment  or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays 
the derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts  futures  options and swaps 
our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required 
the goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements
