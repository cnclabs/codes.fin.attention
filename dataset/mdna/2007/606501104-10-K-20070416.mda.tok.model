item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
we lease and sell geophysical and other equipment used primarily by seismic data acquisition contractors to perform seismic data acquisition surveys on land  in transition zones marsh and shallow water areas and marine areas 
we conduct our operations on a worldwide basis and believe we are the world s largest independent lessor of seismic equipment 
we believe that our competitors  in general  have neither as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as we do  nor similar exclusive lease referral agreements with suppliers 
in recent periods  we have experienced a significant increase in the demand for our equipment 
we believe this demand is driven by oil and gas exploration activities 
exploration activities are impacted by the price of crude oil and natural gas  worldwide demand for these products  economic activity  the maturation of certain petroleum producing basins  the cost of exploration activities and geopolitical issues 
our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world which are described in item business customers  sales and marketing 
we lease seismic equipment worldwide  and on occasion sell new or used seismic equipment through mii in huntsville  texas  and in calgary  alberta through 
table of contents mcl  mse  from its location in ufa  bashkortostan  russia  leases seismic equipment primarily in the russian federation and the commonwealth of independent states cis  which consists of former soviet republics 
sap  from its location in brisbane  australia  leases seismic equipment in australia and other locations within the pacific rim and also sells new seismic  oceanographic and hydrographic equipment throughout the pacific rim 
seamap uk  located in somerset  united kingdom and seamap singapore  located in singapore  design  manufacture and sell marine seismic equipment throughout the world 
we own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers 
our lease pool includes many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition  including various electronic components of land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems  geophones and cables  earth vibrators  peripheral equipment  survey and other equipment 
the majority of our seismic equipment lease pool is provided by two manufacturers  the sercel subsidiaries of compagnie generale de geophysique collectively  sercel and input output  inc i o 
we believe that the majority of the advanced seismic data acquisition systems in use worldwide are either sercel or i o systems 
at january   approximately of our equipment lease pool  on a cost basis  consisted of seismic recording channels  with the remainder consisting of geophones and other peripheral equipment 
we have supply and exclusive lease referral agreements with sercel  which we believe provide us with certain competitive advantages 
under these agreements  we are the exclusive worldwide short term leasing representative for certain products 
we lease our equipment on a short term basis  generally for three to six months  to seismic contractors who need additional capacity to complete a seismic survey 
our lease agreements may contain a purchase option  but generally do not 
short term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies 
a typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys 
our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew 
demand for short term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors  including i the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys  ii seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions  iii the term of the lease and iv cost of seismic equipment 
we believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short term seismic equipment leasing as a cost effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  acquisition cost and the term of the lease 
we also sell a broad range of used seismic equipment on a worldwide basis and sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
seamap designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic  hydrographic and offshore industries 
seamap s primary products include the gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources  and the buoylink gps tracking system  which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
business strategy our business strategy is to meet the needs of the seismic industry by leasing a wide range of equipment and to provide technologically advanced solutions for marine seismic applications 
to accomplish this  we have identified the following major objectives provide a technologically advanced seismic equipment lease pool 
we intend to maintain the size and diversity of our equipment lease pool  including the addition of marine equipment 
we believe that the availability of a large and diverse seismic equipment lease pool encourages seismic data acquisition contractors to lease  rather than purchase  such equipment  due to the capital and operating efficiencies provided by short term leases 
continue to expand international operations 
we intend to expand our international leasing activities in new geographic areas  including the cis and north africa 
we believe there are significant opportunities to continue to expand our international leasing and sales activities 
maintain alliances with major seismic equipment manufacturers 
our relationships with leading seismic equipment manufacturers  sercel and i o  allow us to expand our equipment lease pool on favorable 
table of contents terms 
we believe these relationships improve our access to customers and provide a competitive advantage 
pursue additional business development opportunities 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business activities within the oil service industry  particularly in the seismic sector 
these opportunities could include the introduction of new products or services or the acquisition of existing businesses 
seismic technology and the oil service industry seismic surveys are a principal source of information used by oil and gas companies to identify geological conditions that are favorable for the accumulation of oil and gas and to evaluate the potential for successful drilling  development and production of oil and gas 
seismic technology has been used by the oil and gas industry since the s  and with improvements in computing and electronic technologies  has advanced significantly 
beginning in the early s  the oil and gas industry significantly expanded its use of d seismic data  which provides a more comprehensive subsurface image and is believed to have contributed to improved drilling success rates  particularly in mature oil and gas basins such as those in north america 
additionally  d seismic data continues to be used in many areas where d data acquisition is cost prohibitive or logistical access is limited 
oil and gas exploration companies utilize seismic data generated from the use of digital seismic systems and peripheral equipment in determining optimal locations for drilling oil and gas wells  in the development of oil and gas reserves and in reservoir management for the production of oil and gas 
a complete digital seismic data acquisition system generally consists of i a central electronics unit that records and stores digital data ceu  ii seismic recording channel boxes that contain from one to eight seismic channels channel boxes  iii geophones  or seismic sensors  iv energy sources including dynamite  air guns or earth vibrators that create the necessary acoustic wave to be recorded  v cables that transmit digital seismic data from the channel boxes to the ceu  vi geographic survey equipment  vii drilling equipment used in the seismic survey and viii other peripheral  or accessory  equipment 
in seismic data acquisition  an acoustic wave is generated at or below the earth s surface through the discharge of compressed air  the detonation of small explosive charges or the use of large mechanical vibrators 
as the acoustic wave travels through the earth  it is partially reflected by the underlying rock layers and the reflected energy is captured by the geophones  which are situated at intervals along paths from the point of acoustical impulse 
the resulting signals are then transmitted to the channel boxes  which convert the signals from analog to digital data and transmit this data via cable to the ceu 
the ceu stores the seismic data on magnetic tape  disk or other recording media for processing 
the digital data is then input into a specialized seismic processing system that uses sophisticated computer software programs to enhance the recorded signal and produce an image of the subsurface strata 
by interpreting seismic data  oil and gas exploration companies create detailed maps of exploration prospects and oil and gas reservoirs 
historically  d seismic survey has been the standard data acquisition technique used to map geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data can be visualized as a single vertical plane of subsurface information 
data gathered from a d seismic survey is best visualized as a cube of information that can be sliced into numerous planes  providing different views of a geologic structure with much higher resolution than is available with traditional d seismic survey techniques 
d seismic surveys generally require a larger amount of equipment than d surveys 
by using a greater number of channels and flexible configuration  d seismic data provides more extensive and detailed information regarding the subsurface geology than d data 
as a result  d data allows the geophysicists interpreting the data to more closely select the optimal location of a prospective drill site or oil and gas reservoir 
in the exploration and development process  oil and gas companies establish requirements for seismic data acquisition programs based on their technical objectives 
because of the expense associated with drilling oil and gas wells  decisions regarding whether or where to drill are critical to the overall process 
since d seismic data increases drilling success rates and reduce costs  we believe that d seismic surveys are now predominant 
as a result of the increasing requirements for this higher resolution data  which in turn requires additional channels to collect and transmit the data  seismic data acquisition systems have been expanding in size during the past several years 
industry advances include the use of high resolution d  three component geophones d c  which enhance the d image of the sub surface  and time lapse d seismic  where surveys are periodically reacquired to allow the monitoring of producing oil and gas fields for optimal production and reserve recovery 

table of contents these and other technical advances have contributed to increased drilling success rates and reduced oil and gas finding costs 
with the expanded use of seismic technology  particularly d seismic surveys  the size of data acquisition surveys has increased substantially in the past several years 
demand for higher resolution data  larger surveys and more rapid completion of such surveys is requiring seismic contractors to use data acquisition systems with a greater number of seismic recording channels 
additionally  in many areas  such as north america  the size of seismic surveys varies significantly  requiring frequent changes in the configuration of equipment and crews used for seismic surveys 
as a result of these advances  seismic survey channel count has increased from smaller d surveys  which typically averaged channels  to larger d surveys  which today average approximately  channels and often use  or more channels 
we believe that many seismic contractors will continue to meet changes in equipment needs by leasing incremental equipment to expand crew size as necessary  thereby reducing the substantial capital expenditures required to purchase such equipment 
seismic surveys utilizing d  d or d techniques require essentially the same equipment 
the manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs  however 
accordingly  our equipment can generally be utilized in d  d and d seismic surveys 
additionally d and d seismic surveys generally utilize significantly more equipment than d seismic surveys  which presents us with more opportunities to lease equipment 
business and operations equipment leasing 
we own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short term leasing to our customers  who are primarily seismic contractors 
we lease this equipment multiple times until the end of its useful life or its sale 
our equipment leasing services generally include the lease of the various components of seismic data acquisition systems and related equipment to meet a customer s job specifications 
these specifications frequently vary as to the number of required recording channels  geophones  energy sources eg  earth vibrators and other equipment 
our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment 
our equipment lease pool includes a total of approximately  seismic recording land channels each channel capable of electronically converting seismic data from analog to digital format and transmitting the digital data  geophones and cables  large earth vibrators  peripheral equipment and geographic survey and other equipment 
all of our lease pool equipment is manufactured by leading seismic equipment manufacturers and is widely used in the seismic industry 
our equipment leases generally have terms of three to six months and are typically renewable on a month to month basis 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  initial cost and the term of the lease 
we provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and will provide replacement equipment  as necessary 
in addition  we provide field technical support services when requested by our customers 
pursuant to the terms of our standard lease agreements  the customer is responsible for destroyed or damaged equipment  other than normal wear and tear 
in addition  the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes  other than income taxes  related to the lease of the equipment 
the customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance 
while it is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly basis  we may from time to time lease some equipment on a day rate usage basis in response to market conditions 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity occurs in the winter season  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
in other areas of the world  such as southeast asia and pacific rim  periods of heavy rain  known as monsoons  can impair seismic operations 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization 
upon completion of a lease  the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities for inspection  testing and  if necessary  repair 
while the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs  during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer 
therefore  managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations 
given the short term of most of our leases  we believe that the highest achievable annual utilization for most of our equipment is approximately 
however  many factors can effect this utilization  including the term of our 
table of contents leases  the shipping time required to return equipment to one of our facilities  the time required to inspect  test and repair equipment after return from a lease and the demand for the equipment 
historically  the majority of the inspection  testing and repair has been done in our huntsville  texas or calgary  alberta facilities 
in fiscal we added inspection and testing capabilities to our facility in ufa  bashkortostan  russia 
we plan to add inspection  testing and limited repair capabilities to our facility in singapore during fiscal we believe that by expanding these capabilities we will be able to more effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations 
the incremental cost for the additional facilities is not expected to be material 
lease pool equipment sales 
on occasion  we sell used equipment from our lease pool  normally in response to specific demand or to declining demand for rental of specific equipment 
used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margin depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item 
when used equipment is sold from our lease pool  the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold 
sales of our lease pool equipment are generally opportunistic and do not have a significant seasonal aspect 
we generally expect sales of lease pool equipment to be a smaller component of our business in future periods than they have been historically 
however  should opportunities arise for the sale of certain of our lease pool equipment  we will evaluate such opportunities and may sell additional equipment 
sales of this equipment could be material 
other equipment sales 
other equipment sales  included in our equipment leasing segment  fall into two broad categories sales of new seismic equipment 
on occasion we will sell new seismic equipment in response to a specific demand from a customer 
these sales are made in cooperation with our suppliers of lease pool equipment 
sales of hydrographic and oceanographic equipment 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
sap is a manufacturer s representative for an array of equipment lines 
seamap equipment sales 
seamap designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic  hydrographic and offshore industries 
seamap s primary products include i the gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which are designed to provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources  and ii the buoylink gps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
seamap s design and manufacturing facilities are located in the united kingdom and in singapore 
key supplier agreements the sercel lease agreement in september we entered into a new exclusive equipment lease agreement with sercel under which we are generally the exclusive authorized lessor for sercel s dsu xl products the exclusive products  except that we have agreed not to lease the exclusive products for use in mainland china and we have non exclusive rights to lease the exclusive products in the cis 
the geographic area covering the exclusive arrangement is referred to as the exclusive territory 
under the agreement  we have also agreed not to offer financing leases or leases with terms greater than one year related to the exclusive products without sercel s prior consent 
sercel has agreed to refer any inquires for short term rentals of the exclusive products for use within the exclusive territory to us and to not recommend any competitor of ours as a source of such rentals 
we and sercel have agreed to cooperate in the promotion and marketing of the exclusive products 
the agreement provides that sercel will grant us specified pricing for the purchase of the exclusive products and certain other products 
in return  we have agreed to purchase a total of  stations  or  channels  of the exclusive products through december  as of january   we have purchased  stations  or  channels  of these products 
the agreement allows us  however  to purchase other equipment from sercel to satisfy these purchase obligations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our remaining commitments regarding these purchase obligations 
we had previously entered into a similar agreement with sercel regarding other equipment 
this agreement expired by its own terms on december  
table of contents other agreements sap has a number of manufacturer s representation agreements for major product lines  including acoustic positioning systems  data acquisition systems  geophones  hydrophones  connectors  cables  test equipment  gps systems  heave compensators and attitude sensors  hydrographic data acquisition systems  magnetometers  tide gauges and current meters  radio positioning equipment  side scan sonar and sub bottom profiling systems  underwater communications and location devices  echo sounders and transducers 
seamap has a cooperation agreement with tanglesolve instrumentation ltd 
tanglesolve pursuant to which tanglesolve has developed certain software utilized in our gunlink products 
we pay tanglesolve a fee related to each of the gunlink systems we sell 
this fee is calculated based on our gross profit from the sale of the products 
tanglesolve provides on going support services for which it receives a portion of the annual maintenance fees paid by purchasers of the gunlink products 
customers  sales  backlog and marketing our lease customers are seismic data acquisition contractors 
we typically have a small number of lease customers  the composition of which changes yearly as leases are negotiated and concluded and equipment needs vary 
as of january   we had approximately lease customers with active leases of various lengths  but typically for less than a year 
our seismic equipment sales customers include seismic data acquisition contractors  foreign governments  universities  engineering firms and research organizations worldwide 
generally  we do not maintain a backlog of orders relating to our equipment leasing segment 
as of january   our seamap segment had a backlog of orders amounting to approximately million 
we expect all of these orders to be shipped during our fiscal year ending january  we participate in both domestic and international trade shows and expositions to inform the industry of our products and services and we advertise in major geophysical trade journals 
a summary of our revenues from customers by geographic region  outside the us  is as follows in thousands year ended january  uk europe canada south america asia south pacific eurasia other totals comprised of eastern europe  the russian federation and the cis includes africa  mexico and the middle east the net book value of our fixed assets in our various locations is as follows in thousands as of january  location of property and equipment united states canada australia russia singapore united kingdom total for information regarding the risks associated with our foreign operations  see item a risk factors 
effective january   the merger of compagnie generale de geophysique cgg and veritas dgc  inc veritas was completed  forming an entity known as cggveritas 
both cgg and veritas were 
table of contents our customers 
had cggveritas been in existence for all of our fiscal year ended january   sales to that entity would have represented approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
neither cgg nor veritas individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in fiscal sercel is a subsidiary of cggveritas 
veritas represented approximately of fiscal and total revenues 
no other customer exceeded of revenues for fiscal and see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the location of our lease pool equipment located in the united states and in foreign locations 
competition our major competitors are the major seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms 
we face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing  but competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as we do 
we compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of i price and delivery  ii variety and availability of both peripheral seismic equipment and complete data acquisition systems and iii length of lease term 
we believe that our broad geographic presence is also a major competitive advantage 
we compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad base of seismic equipment owners  including seismic data acquisition contractors  which use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than we 
we believe there is one competitor in the used seismic equipment sales business that generates comparable revenues from such sales  as well as numerous  smaller competitors who  in the aggregate  generate significant revenue from such sales 
suppliers we have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool 
we acquire the majority of our seismic lease pool equipment from two equipment manufacturers  sercel and i o 
other suppliers of peripheral seismic equipment include oyo geospace corporation geophones and cables  steward cable cables and seismic source company shooting systems 
from time to time  we purchase new and used peripheral seismic equipment from various other manufacturers 
management believes that our current relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 
employees as of january   we employed people  none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 
intellectual property the products designed  manufactured and sold by our seamap segment utilize significant intellectual property that we have developed or have licensed from others

table of contents item a 
risk factors demand for seismic data is not assured demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition worldwide 
the levels of such spending are influenced by oil and gas prices and industry expectations of future price levels  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the availability of current geophysical data  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  oil and gas prices  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated significantly 
these fluctuations have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
loss of significant customers will adversely affect us we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in the fiscal years ended january   and  our single largest customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
because our customer base is relatively small  the loss of one or more customers for any reason could adversely affect our results of operations 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in the fiscal year ended january  industry consolidation could adversely affect us there has recently been considerable consolidation among certain of our customers and this trend may continue 
this consolidation could result in the loss of our customers and or could result in a decrease in the demand for our equipment 
significant defaults of past due customer accounts would adversely affect our results of operations on january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and notes receivable  of which million was over days past due 
at january   we had an allowance of approximately million to cover losses in our receivable balances 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
international economic and political instability could adversely our results of operations our results of operations are dependent upon the current political and economic climate of several countries in which our customers either operate or are located 
international sources of revenues including canada accounted for approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended january  many of our operations are conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
those currencies include the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the singapore dollar and the british pound sterling 
in the future  we may also conduct significant business in the russian ruble 
therefore  we are subject to risks from fluctuations in the value of those currencies 
our internationally sourced revenues are also subject to the risk of currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars  taxation policies  and expropriation  as well as to political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other geopolitical hazards 
foreign currency exchange rates have increasingly materially affected our financial statements for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of our operating subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has in the past  and may in the 
table of contents future be  material because of the significant amount of assets held by our international subsidiaries and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates 
our operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected if we are unable to continually obtain additional lease contracts our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of three to six months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment on the initial lease 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lease customers are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other customers after the termination of the original leases we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
our failure to retain key personnel could adversely affect our operations our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our president and chief executive officer  mr 
michael pinnington  our managing director of seamap uk and mr 
mark welker  our managing director of seamap pte ltd 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham  mr 
pinnington or mr 
welker could have a material adverse effect on us 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment  and to correspondingly invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers 
weather conditions cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our lease revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in leasing revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada and russia from january through march or april 
this seasonal pattern may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
we face competition in our seismic equipment leasing activities we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers and data acquisition contractors that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than us 
competition exists to a lesser extent from seismic data acquisition contractors that may lease equipment that is temporarily idle 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenue from the sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 
we rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations we purchase the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers 
we believe we have satisfactory relationships with our suppliers 
however  should those relationships deteriorate  we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining our existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers specifications 
in addition  we may  from time to time  experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers  and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involve several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules  any of these could adversely affect our future results of operations 

table of contents the operations of seamap are subject to special risks the design and manufacturing operations of our seamap segment are subject to risks not associated with our equipment leasing business 
these risks include the following risks associated with intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our design information  documentation and other proprietary information 
these intellectual property protection measures may not be sufficient to prevent wrongful misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  these measures will not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the laws of many foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect proprietary information could result in  among other things  loss of competitive advantage  loss of customer orders and decreased revenues 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be impaired 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  require us to redesign the products that use the technology  or prevent manufacturing or sale of our products that incorporate the technology 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
any litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend ourselves against the claims of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful 
risks related to product performance 
the production of new products with high technology content involves occasional problems while the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
if significant reliability or quality problems develop  including those due to faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with reworking the manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there will be interruptions or delays in the activation of products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that cannot be promptly resolved  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
risks related to raw materials 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to design and test our products 
certain components used in our products are only available from a sole source or limited number of vendors 
if these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us  or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components  these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues  materials shortages  excess demand  reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us  thereby adversely affecting our business and 
table of contents customer relationships 
some of the sole source and limited source vendors are companies who  from time to time  may allocate parts to equipment manufacturers due to market demand for components and equipment 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements 
many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared vendors  thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components 
if our supply arrangements are interrupted  we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from alternative sources  reduced supplies and higher prices of components will significantly limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers 
a delay in receiving certain components or the inability to receive certain components could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
failures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products  can reduce customer confidence in our products  and may adversely affect our financial performance 
from time to time  we may experience delays in receipt of components and may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could harm our business

the equipment manufacturing segment is conducted by our seamap subsidiary and therefore is referred to as our seamap segment 
our equipment leasing operations are conducted from our huntsville  texas headquarters and from our locations in calgary  canada  brisbane  australia  and ufa  russia 
this includes the operations of our mitcham canada  sap and mse subsidiaries 
we acquired seamap in july seamap operates from its locations near bristol  united kingdom and in singapore 
management believes that the performance of our equipment leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment 
management further believes that the performance of our seamap segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales 
management monitors ebitda and adjusted ebitda  both as defined in the following table  as key indicators of our overall performance

we consider ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be important indicators for the performance of our business  but not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we have included these non gaap financial measures because they provide management with important information for assessing our performance and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures and finance working capital requirements 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda or adjusted ebitda differently than we do and ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
in our equipment leasing segment  we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements and offer technical support during the lease term 
the majority of all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
we acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our seamap segment 
these amounts  which have not been material to date  are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our seamap segment 
from time to time  we sell lease pool equipment to our customers 
these sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business 
we also occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers 
in addition to conducting seismic equipment leasing operations  sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
our seamap segment designs  manufactures and sells a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic applications 
seamap s primary products include the i gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools  and ii the buoylink gps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
our lease revenue is seasonal  especially in canada and russia  where a significant percentage of seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from january through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other equipment because of the unstable terrain 
additionally  monsoons that occur in some areas of southeast asia and the pacific rim may disrupt seismic operations 
our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which in turn are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews 
because an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
nonetheless  we believe the seismic industry is currently enjoying a period of stable and sustained growth 
this is evidenced by increased demand for our equipment 
table of contents and by improving financial results as reported by many seismic contractors 
we believe that this increase is being driven by relatively high world oil and north american natural gas prices  combined with the maturation of the world s hydrocarbon producing basins 
the future direction and magnitude of changes in seismic data acquisition activity levels will continue to be dependent upon oil and natural gas prices to a large degree 
the market for products sold by seamap is dependent upon activity within the offshore  or marine  seismic industry  including the re fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels 
current prices of oil and natural gas have resulted in increased activity in the oil and gas industry and in turn resulted in an increased demand for seismic services 
this has contributed to an increased demand for leasing of our equipment 
we cannot predict how long the current trend will last  but we believe that a depressed oil and gas industry results in lower demand  thus lower revenues from the leasing of our equipment 
we do not quantitatively calculate utilization rates for our equipment lease pool 
however  we do subjectively monitor factors which we believe reflect trends in utilization 
we have relatively fixed costs within certain revenue ranges and  as a result  our earnings are particularly sensitive to changes in utilization and demand for our lease equipment 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from international customers totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this amount represents  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian  canadian and singapore dollars and british pounds sterling 
our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years  except as described above 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded operating income of approximately million  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  and approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  our results for the year ended january  were negatively impacted by issues in our seamap segment related to a new product that was introduced during this period 
in addition  the results for this period were affected by expenses related to stock based compensation and by compliance with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
operating income increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to increased equipment leasing revenues 
our equipment leasing segment recorded increased gross profit in the year ended january  of approximately million  as compared to approximately million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to increased rental activity brought about by the continued increased demand for seismic equipment and decreased depreciation expense related to our equipment lease pool 
in late september  we were notified by a customer of certain mechanical failures relating to a specific version of our gunlink product that was introduced by our seamap segment earlier that year 
the gunlink product line is utilized on seismic vessels to coordinate and control the energy sources utilized in marine seismic surveys 
this version of the gunlink product is designed to operate with an energy source  an airgun in this case  recently introduced by another manufacturer 
in cooperation with our customer  we immediately began to investigate the cause of the failure 
the investigation revealed a design flaw in this particular version of the gunlink product 
the design flaw did not affect the functionality of the conventional airgun version of this product  which we confirmed through an evaluation of the conventional version 
we have completed changes to correct the design flaw 
certain of these changes were implemented in all versions of the gunlink product to ensure compatibility in the production process 
during this process we incurred significant costs  which we expect to be non recurring  amounting to approximately million  including approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal these costs include the cost to investigate and redesign the product  costs to support the operations of our customers during the process  including replacement components and on site support  and replacement and refurbishment of some components of our inventory 
as a result of these problems  one gunlink system that we had expected to ship during the year was delayed and not delivered until march in addition  the order for an additional gunlink that had been scheduled for delivery during the year ended january  was converted to an order for a gunlink system  which is scheduled for delivery in fiscal had these shipments occurred as originally anticipated  revenues for equipment sales would have increased by approximately million for the year 
table of contents ended january  as of january   the backlog of orders for our seamap segment totaled approximately million 
this backlog includes orders for gunlink  gunlink  buoylink and various other products 
effective february   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
accordingly  the amount of expense recognized related to stock based compensation during the year ended january  was approximately million  as compared to approximately  in the year ended january  and  in the year ended january  effective january   we became an accelerated filer as defined in rule b of the exchange act 
accordingly  our management is now required to assess and report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting 
furthermore  our independent registered public accounting firm is required to opine on management s assessment of those controls and on the effectiveness of the controls 
accordingly  in the year ended january   we incurred expenses amounting to approximately  related to these assessments that were not incurred in prior periods 
revenues and cost of sales equipment leasing revenue from our equipment leasing segment is comprised of the following year ended january  in thousands equipment leasing lease pool equipment sales new seismic equipment sales sap equipment sales equipment leasing revenues have increased in each of the past three fiscal years due to increased demand for seismic equipment  expansion into new geographic markets and expansion of our lease pool  including equipment for marine applications 
the demand for seismic equipment is primarily driven by the global oil and gas exploration issues discussed above 
in fiscal  we added approximately million of new lease pool equipment due to additional demand from customers 
however  approximately of this equipment was acquired in the fourth quarter and did not contribute significantly to our leasing revenues in fiscal from time to time  we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy our capital in other lease pool assets 
these transactions tend to be opportunistic and accordingly are difficult to predict 
the gross profit from the sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately million  million  and million in the years ended january   and  respectively 
often the equipment that is sold from our lease pool has been held by us  and therefore depreciated  for some period of time 
accordingly  the equipment sold may have a relatively low net book value at the time of the sale  resulting in a relatively high gross margin from the transaction 
the amount of the margin on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment 
occasionally  we will sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers 
often these arrangements are structured with a significant down payment  with the balance financed over a period of time at a market rate of interest 
in the year ended january   we entered into four such transactions in which we financed a portion of the selling price for periods of approximately to months 
sap regularly sells new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in australia and throughout the pacific rim 
the gross profit from the sale of new seismic equipment and hydrographic and oceanographic equipment amounted to approximately million   and  in the years ended january   and  respectively 
seamap sales of seamap equipment for the year ended january   amounted to approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million related to sales to our equipment leasing segment that are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations 
for the year ended january   revenues from the 
table of contents seamap segment amounted to approximately million but included only seven months of results for seamap  which we acquired in july sales of seamap products increased between fiscal and due to the full period of operations in fiscal and due to increased demand for the seamap products  including the buoylink and gunlink products 
demand for marine seismic equipment is influenced generally by the same factors that impact demand for the rental of seismic equipment 
as discussed above  we believe that sales of seamap equipment were negatively impacted by approximately million in the year ended january  due to the issues related to the gunlink product 
in addition  orders for two gunlink systems  along with other ancillary equipment  amounting to approximately million were not shipped in the fourth quarter of due to production delays and customers vessels not being ready for installation of the equipment 
these orders were shipped in the first quarter of fiscal the gross profit from the sale of seamap equipment included in our consolidated results of operations amounted to approximately million  or  of seamap revenues for the year ended january   as compared to approximately million  or  of seamap revenues for the year ended january  as stated earlier  gross profit for fiscal was negatively impacted by approximately million of non recurring costs associated with the gunlink design issue 
lower gross profit can also be attributed to high initial production cost related to the introduction of new products 
other direct costs equipment leasing depreciation expense related to lease pool equipment for fiscal amounted to approximately million  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the decline in depreciation expense is due to more of our equipment becoming fully depreciated 
at january   approximately million of our lease pool assets were fully depreciated 
this compares to million at january  and approximately million at january  these assets  though fully depreciated  are expected to generate revenue through leasing activity 
the decline in depreciation expense due to fully depreciated equipment in fiscal was offset to some extent by increased depreciation from new equipment purchases 
however  much of the equipment purchased in fiscal was not acquired or placed in service until late in the year and therefore did not materially affect depreciation expense 
our business generally parallels trends in the oil and gas industry 
when the oil and gas industry was depressed over the period from to  we experienced net losses for those periods 
as the oil and gas industry is on an upward trend  we are experiencing increased demand for our equipment  including equipment that has been fully depreciated 
increased demand for our equipment results in higher revenues and generally has no impact on depreciation in the short term as our equipment is depreciated from the first month it is placed in service until it is fully depreciated 
depreciation expense is recorded monthly whether or not the equipment is actually generating revenue on a lease contract 
during periods of high demand  such as the one we are currently experiencing  our ability to lease older equipment  including fully depreciated equipment is enhanced  whereas in periods of low demand  the opposite is true 
as a result  revenues and depreciation expense will not necessarily directly correlate 
over the long term  depreciation expense is impacted by increases in equipment purchases to meet growing demand for our leased equipment 
we have been able to purchase equipment at discounts through volume purchase arrangements 
a lower purchase price results in lower depreciation expense than in previous periods 
although some of the equipment in our lease pool has reached the end of its depreciable life  given the increased demand  the equipment continues to be in service and continues to generate revenue 
because the depreciable life of our equipment in our industry is determined more by technical obsolescence than by usage or wear and tear  some of our equipment  although fully depreciated  is still capable of functioning appropriately 
currently  in our industry  higher demand is generating more leasing revenue and older equipment is more in demand than in prior periods 
we recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal in the amount of approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  repairs and sublease expense 
costs in fiscal decreased in spite of higher leasing revenues  primarily due to greater reimbursement of costs from our customers and lower costs to lease certain equipment from others 
operating costs general and administrative expenses for fiscal amounted to approximately million  compared to approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
a significant portion of the increase from fiscal to fiscal  and substantially all of the increase from fiscal to fiscal  is 
table of contents attributable to the operations of seamap 
we acquired seamap in july and accordingly  fiscal was the first year to include a full twelve months of these operations as compared to seven months of operations in fiscal also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal were the effects of recognizing stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r and the costs of complying with sox in fiscal  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million  as compared to approximately  in fiscal  and approximately  in expenses related to compliance with sox under sfas r  which we adopted effective february   the fair value of stock based awards  such as stock options and restricted stock  is estimated at the time of the grant 
this estimated value is then amortized over the expected vesting period of the award as compensation expense 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  compensation expense was only recognized in connection with restricted stock awards 
during fiscal  and  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in the amount of   and  respectively 
at january  and  we had past due trade accounts and note receivables of approximately million and million  respectively 
in our industry  and in our experience  it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectible 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable amounted to approximately million 
depreciation and amortization  other than lease pool depreciation  amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately  in fiscal this increase reflects a full year of amortization of intangible assets acquired with seamap 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately  against our seismic equipment lease pool in fiscal of this amount   was attributable to land systems  cables  geophones and land peripherals and  was impaired in marine and other equipment 
we also recorded impairment of  for slow moving and obsolete lease pool inventory during the year 
interest and other income  net net interest and other income for fiscal amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  in fiscal and net interest expense of approximately  in fiscal these increases reflect higher levels of invested funds in fiscal and  as well as generally higher rates received on those invested funds 
the interest income was partially offset by interest expense of  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal related to notes issued in connection with the seamap acquisition in july provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal consists of a current provision of approximately  and a deferred benefit of approximately million 
the current taxes payable consist of foreign taxes of approximately  and approximately  payable in the united states 
income taxes currently payable in the united states are reduced by approximately  due to deductions arising from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
this amount does not reduce our current tax provision but is credited directly to paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the deferred tax benefit arises from the recognition of deferred tax assets  for which we had partially provided a valuation allowance in prior periods 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating losses carry forwards from prior periods and book tax differences related to fixed assets 
in prior periods we had not fully recognized these deferred tax assets as their realization was not assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
however  given our profitable operations in fiscal and and our expectation of profitable operations in future periods  we have relieved the remaining valuation allowance and have recognized the remaining deferred tax assets in the year ended january  in fiscal we had a current tax provision of approximately  and a deferred income tax benefit of million as a result of a reduction of our valuation allowance by that same amount 
at january   we evaluated potential realization of our deferred tax assets and as a result reduced the valuation allowance 
in fiscal we had current tax expense of  and no deferred provision 
as of january   we had established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash has been cash flows provided by operating activities 
during fiscal  and  our cash flows from operating activities were affected by several significant factors 
the 
table of contents principal factor that has affected our cash flows is a marked increase in oil and gas exploration and development activities 
increases in the price of oil and natural gas have improved market conditions and have increased demand for our equipment 
as of january   we had working capital of approximately million and cash and temporary investments of approximately million as compared to net working capital of approximately million and cash and temporary investments of approximately million at january  our working capital declined between fiscal and fiscal  in spite of our profitable operations during that period  due to significant purchases of new lease pool equipment during fiscal cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities were net income of million and non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization totaling approximately million and stock based compensation of approximately million 
these amounts were offset by the effect of our deferred tax benefit for fiscal of approximately million and the gross profit from the sale of lease pool equipment of approximately million 
the net change in other current assets and liabilities decreased net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal by approximately million 
included within this net change were several significant items 
increases in trade accounts and notes receivable resulted in a decrease of approximately million 
these changes were due to increased revenues and the resulting increase in trade accounts receivable and notes receivable taken in partial consideration in four sales of new seismic equipment during the year see results of operations above 
inventories increased by approximately million in fiscal due to increased production levels within seamap  especially related to the gunlink products 
offsetting these items was an increase in accounts payable that increased net cash provided by operations by approximately million 
cash flow used in investing activities for fiscal includes capital expenditures totaling approximately million  including million for lease pool additions 
we purchased a total of approximately million of new lease pool equipment in fiscal  however  payment for approximately million of this amount was not made until the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  these amounts are not reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended january  the million of lease pool equipment purchases are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  this compares with approximately million  including approximately million for lease pool additions  in fiscal and approximately million  including approximately million for lease pool additions in fiscal we generally acquire new lease pool equipment in response to specific customer demand 
in fiscal we significantly expanded the amount of new equipment  including purchases of additional land seismic channels  marine recording channels and three component recording channels 
these purchases were made based on demand from customers and we expect to increase our leasing revenues as a result of this new equipment 
we have been able to purchase new equipment for our lease pool at lower prices in recent years through volume purchasing discounts 
we do not anticipate that we will continue this higher level of equipment purchases  however  we may do so if favorable economic factors continue to exist 
in fiscal we received approximately million in cash from the sale of lease pool equipment 
this compares with approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the amount we receive from the sale of lease pool equipment could vary significantly based on market conditions and the demand for equipment 
we generally do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment  but do so from time to time 
we will sell lease pool equipment in response to specific demand from customers if the selling price exceeds the estimated present value of projected future leasing revenue from that equipment 
our net cash used in investing activities for fiscal reflects a payment of million to the former owners of seamap 
this payment was made pursuant to the earn out arrangement included in the seamap acquisition agreement 
we anticipate that in fiscal we will make a second  and final  million earn out payment pursuant to this agreement 
in fiscal we utilized approximately million in cash  which is net of million in cash acquired  to fund the acquisition of seamap 
during fiscal  we purchased million in certificates of deposit and redeemed million  with interest rates varying from to and maturities of six to nine months 
financing activities include the sale of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
these transactions resulted in cash provided of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal we utilized  in cash for the repayment of borrowings 
in fiscal the amount utilized for the repayment of borrowings was approximately million 

table of contents on february   we extended our million revolving loan agreement with first victoria national bank the bank which we originally entered into on june  the agreement amended the arrangement to provide for a maturity date of february  all other terms of the agreement remain unchanged 
the facility bears interest at the prime rate 
amounts available under the facility are subject to a borrowing base comprising eligible accounts receivable and eligible lease pool equipment 
we believe that the full amount of the facility is available for borrowing based on these criteria 
interest on any outstanding principle balance is payable monthly  while the principal is due at the end of the two year term 
the revolving loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants that require  among other things  that we maintain a debt to shareholders equity ratio of a maximum of to  maintain a current assets to current liabilities ratio of a minimum of to  and not incur or maintain any indebtedness or obligations or guarantee the debts or obligations of others in a total aggregate amount which exceeds million without the prior written approval of the bank  except for indebtedness incurred as a result of the seamap acquisition and other specific exceptions 
as of march   there is million outstanding under the facility 
we intend to utilize this facility from time to time to fund short term working capital needs  such as occurred in february due to the purchase of significant amounts of lease pool equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the july seamap acquisition  we issued million in promissory notes payable to the former shareholders of seamap 
the notes bear interest at annually with interest payable annually at each anniversary date of the notes 
principle is payable in two equal installments on the second and third year anniversary of the notes 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and from proceeds of our existing working capital facility 
should we make additional substantial purchases of lease pool equipment or should we purchase other businesses we may seek other sources of debt or equity financing 
as of january   we had deposits in foreign banks equal to approximately million 
these funds may generally be transferred to our accounts in the united states without restriction 
however  the transfer of these funds may result in withholding taxes payable to foreign taxing authorities 
any such transfer taxes generally may be credited against our federal income tax obligations in the united states 
additionally  the transfer of funds from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may result in currently taxable income in the united states 
the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total pursuant to our exclusive lease agreement with sercel  we agreed to purchase of total of  stations  channels of dsu xl equipment by december  as of january   we have purchased  stations  channels  which is included in our purchases of seismic equipment held for lease for the year ended january  under the agreement  however  we may  for good business reasons  substitute purchases of other equipment from sercel to meet this obligation 
we believe that as of january  we have made sufficient purchases of equipment from sercel that satisfy our obligations under the agreement 
we do  however  anticipate making additional purchases of dsu xl equipment from sercel during the remaining term of the agreement 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and useful lives of our lease pool assets  useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and our impairment assessment of the lease pool and various intangible assets 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease unless there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
commission income is recognized once it has been paid to us 
we do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease  the customer is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding normal wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from the equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred  unless there is a question as to its collectibility 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally one to two years in duration 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically  as conditions warrant  based on whether such receivables are estimated to be collectible 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance and do not recognize interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
long lived assets we carry our lease pool of equipment and other property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from two to years 
cables are depreciated over two years  geophones over three years  channel boxes over five to seven years and earth vibrators and other heavy equipment are depreciated over a year period 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of useful life and the life of the lease 
intangible assets are amortized from three to years 
the estimated useful lives for rental equipment are based on our experience as to the economic useful life of its products 
we review and consider industry trends in determining the appropriate useful life for our lease pool equipment  including technological obsolescence  market demand and actual historical useful service life of our lease pool equipment 
additionally  to the extent information is available publicly  we compare our depreciation policies to those of other companies in our industry for reasonableness 
when we purchase new equipment for our lease pool  we begin to depreciate it upon its first use and depreciation continues each month until the equipment is fully depreciated  whether or not the equipment is actually in use during that entire time period 
our policy regarding the removal of assets that are fully depreciated from our books is the following if an asset is fully depreciated and is still expected to generate revenue  then the asset will remain on our books 
however if a fully depreciated asset is not expected to have any revenue generating capacity  then it is removed from our books 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a review of our lease pool assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we typically review all major categories of assets not each individual asset in our consolidated lease pool with remaining net book value to ascertain 
table of contents whether or not we believe that a particular asset group will generate sufficient cash flow over their remaining life to recover the remaining carrying value of those assets 
assets that we believe will not generate cash flow sufficient to cover the remaining net book value are subject to impairment 
we make our assessments based on customer demand  current market trends and market value of our equipment to determine if it will be able to recover its remaining net book value from future leasing or sales 
during fiscal we recorded no impairment charge related to the valuation of our seismic equipment lease pool  while during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we have assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider the following positive indicators the current level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities resulting from historically high prices for oil and natural gas  increasing world demand for oil  our recent history of profitable operations in various jurisdictions  our anticipated positive income in various jurisdictions  and our existing customer relationships 
we also considered the following negative indicators the risk of the world oil supply increasing  thereby depressing the price of oil and natural gas  the risk of decreased global demand for oil  and the potential for increased competition in the seismic equipment leasing and sales business 
based on our evaluation of the evidence  we believe that it is appropriate to reduce our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to approximately million  which gave rise to deferred tax assets of approximately million at january  the remaining valuation allowance relates exclusively to deductions arising from the exercise of stock options 
the benefit from these amounts may not be recognized until realized by reducing current income taxes payable 
when recognized the benefit will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital 
stock based compensation effective february   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  stock based compensation expense recognized for share based awards during the fiscal year ended january  includes i compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and ii compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
determining the grant date fair value under both sfas r and sfas requires management to make estimates regarding the variables used in the calculation of the grant date fair value 
those variables are the future volatility of our common stock price  the length of time an optionee will hold their options until exercising them the expected term  and the number of options or shares that will be forfeited before they are exercised the forfeiture rate 
we utilize various mathematical models in calculating the variables 

table of contents share based compensation expense could be different if we used different models to calculate the variables 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both and 
the cumulative effect of applying this pronouncement to uncertain tax positions at the date of adoption will be recorded during the fiscal year beginning february  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas requires quantitative disclosures using a tabular format in all periods interim and annual and qualitative disclosures about the valuation techniques used to measure fair value in all annual periods 
sfas will be effective for our fiscal year beginning february  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas will be effective for us on february  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of foreign locations which gives rise to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to the extent possible  we attempt to denominate our transactions in foreign locations in us dollars 
for those cases in which transactions are not denominated in us dollars  we are exposed to risk from changes in exchange rates to the extent that non us dollar revenues exceed non us dollar expenses related to those operations 
our non us dollar transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling  canadian dollars  australian dollars and singapore dollars 
as a result of these transactions  we generally hold cash balances that are denominated in these foreign currencies 
at january   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents included foreign currency denominated amounts equivalent to approximately million in us dollars 
a increase in the us dollar as compared to each of these currencies would result in a loss of approximately  in the us dollar value of these deposits  while a decrease would result in an equal amount of gain 
we do not currently hold or issue foreign exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge these exposures 

table of contents some of our foreign operations are conducted through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
we currently have subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  australian dollar and the singapore dollar 
assets and liabilities from these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gains or losses are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
approximately of our net assets is impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we recorded a decrease of approximately  in our equity in the year ended january  related to strengthening of the us dollar against the foreign currencies mentioned above
