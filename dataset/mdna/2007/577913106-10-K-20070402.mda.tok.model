in addition to the decline in sales for the real estate segment  there was a million decline in net sales for the company s forest products segment

risk factors for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the company s forest products business segment has become increasingly unpredictable due to regulatory constraints and ongoing litigation challenges and harvest levels have declined significantly 
on january   the debtors palco and its five wholly owned subsidiaries  including scopac filed the bankruptcy cases  separate voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code  in the bankruptcy court the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas 
the six companies that filed for voluntary protection were scopac and the palco debtors palco  britt  sdllc  salmon creek and scotia inn inc scotia inn 
the term filing date shall mean january  the bankruptcy cases are being jointly administered case no 
c  with the debtors managing their business in the ordinary course as debtors in possession subject to the control and supervision of the bankruptcy court 
the filing of the bankruptcy cases was precipitated by liquidity shortfalls at palco and scopac and their resultant inability to make january interest payments on their respective debt obligations  arising from regulatory restrictions and limitations on timber harvest  increased timber harvesting costs and cyclical lumber prices 
both scopac and palco undertook various efforts in to generate additional liquidity to satisfy their respective debt service obligations  however  the cash generated from their efforts  together with their cash flows from operations  was not sufficient to cover their respective interest payment shortfalls in january see financial condition and investing and financial activities forest product operations for further discussion 
during  comprehensive external and internal reviews were conducted of palco s business operations 
these reviews were conducted in an effort to identify ways in which palco could operate on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
since  palco has implemented a number of changes  including closing four of its five sawmills  eliminating certain of its operations  including its company staffed logging operations now relying exclusively on contract loggers  its soil amendment and concrete block activities  and its scotia finishing and remanufacturing plant  and adopting various cost saving measures 
palco has continued to examine ways in which to achieve cost savings 
in april  palco commenced a mill improvement project  including a new sawmill located in scotia  california 
the new sawmill was constructed in two phases 
the first phase of the project  the processing of smaller diameter second growth logs up to in diameter is a high speed processing line that includes advanced scanning and optimization technology intended to maximize lumber recovery 
the second phase  the relocation of large log equipment from the carlotta mill  came on line in october this phase allows for processing of larger logs up to in diameter 
palco also completed a new million planer project in scotia in january the new planer is capable of processing rough sawn boards into finished lumber more rapidly 
these improvements have not been sufficient to overcome the adverse effects of regulatory harvest limits

results of operations between quarterly periods are generally not comparable for this segment due to the timing  varying lengths and types of racing meets held 
historically  sam houston race park and valley race park have derived a significant amount of their annual pari mutuel commissions from live racing and simulcasting 
pari mutuel commissions have typically been highest during the first and fourth quarters of the year  the time during which sam houston race park and valley race park have historically conducted live thoroughbred and greyhound racing  respectively

overview the company conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries 
accordingly  creditors of subsidiaries of the company have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of the creditors of the company 
certain of the company s subsidiaries  principally palco and scopac  are restricted by their various debt instruments as to the amount of funds that can be paid in the form of dividends or loaned to affiliates 
scopac is highly leveraged and has significant debt service requirements 
palco is also highly leveraged and has significant debt service obligations 
on january   palco  scopac and palco s other subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy cases are being jointly administered  with the debtors managing their business in the ordinary course as debtors in possession subject to the control and supervision of the bankruptcy court 
the filing of the bankruptcy cases was precipitated by liquidity shortfalls at palco and scopac and their resultant inability to make january interest payments on their respective debt obligations  arising from regulatory restrictions and limitations on timber harvest  increased timber harvesting costs and cyclical lumber prices

cash flow as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases  the operative documents provide that the outstanding principal of  and accrued interest on  all debt obligations of the debtors became immediately due and payable 
however  the vast majority of the claims in existence at the filing date including claims for principal and accrued interest on the debtors indebtedness and substantially all legal claims are stayed deferred while the debtors continue to operate the businesses as debtors in possession 
the automatic stay provisions of chapter of the bankruptcy code make it unnecessary to reclassify prepetition long term liabilities as of the filing date even though prepetition creditors might demand payment or there is violation of a covenant in the debt agreement 
accordingly  the debtors long term obligations  except for the palco term loan  where the borrowers did not meet the required minimum ebitda maintenance covenant for the three months ended december   have been classified in accordance with their contractual terms in the company s consolidated financial statements and in the cash flow table below

the holders of the scopac timber notes have priority over the claims of creditors of palco with respect to the assets and cash flows of scopac 
palco s credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants which effectively preclude the distribution of funds from palco to mgi 
on january   palco and its five wholly owned subsidiaries  including scopac  filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy cases are being jointly administered  with the debtors managing their business in the ordinary course as debtors in possession subject to the control and supervision of the bankruptcy court 
the filing of the bankruptcy cases was precipitated by liquidity shortfalls at palco and scopac and their resultant inability to make january interest payments on their respective debt obligations  arising from regulatory restrictions and limitations on timber harvest  increased timber harvesting costs and cyclical lumber prices 
both scopac and palco undertook various efforts in to generate additional liquidity to satisfy their respective debt service obligations  however  the cash generated from their efforts  together with their cash flows from operations  was not sufficient to cover their respective interest payment shortfalls in january scopac s indebtedness consists of the scopac timber notes  the class a  class a and class a timber collateralized notes due million principal outstanding as of december   and the scopac line of credit  a line of credit with a group of banks pursuant to which scopac was permitted to borrow to pay interest on the scopac timber notes the scopac line of credit million principal outstanding as of december   and each being secured by i scopac s timber  timberlands and timber rights  ii certain contract rights and other assets  iii the proceeds of the foregoing and iv the funds held by the trustee under the scopac indenture the trustee in various accounts related to the scopac timber notes 
annual interest obligations related to scopac s debt facilities were approximately million as of december  see note for further information regarding scopac s debt obligations 
palco s indebtedness consists of a five year million secured term loan the palco term loan million principal outstanding as of december  and a five year million secured asset based revolving credit facility the palco revolving credit facility million of borrowings outstanding and million of letters of credit issued as of december  
these facilities are secured by a security interest in the stock of palco held by mgi  and substantially all of the assets of the palco debtors other than palco s equity interest in scopac 
annual interest obligations related to palco s long term debt obligations were approximately million as of december  see note for further information regarding palco s debt obligations 
the debtors overall objectives in the bankruptcy cases are to achieve an operational and financial restructuring of each of the debtors long term debt obligations in view of estimated lower harvest levels  increased regulatory compliance costs  cyclical lumber prices  and also to continue their businesses 
see financial difficulties of the forest products entities below 
there can be no assurance that the debtors will be able to attain these objectives and achieve a successful operational and financial reorganization 
in the event the debtors are unsuccessful in attaining a successful operational and financial reorganization  the debtors could be forced to surrender all or substantially all of their assets to their creditors 
many of the matters discussed elsewhere in this document could adversely affect the debtors ability to achieve an operational and financial restructuring 
the outcome of the bankruptcy cases is impossible to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the debtors  on the interests of creditors  and on the company 
as provided by the bankruptcy code  each of the debtors generally has the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization during the exclusivity period  a day period following the date of filing of the bankruptcy cases  unless certain statutory exceptions apply or the bankruptcy court orders otherwise 
for instance  a group of holders of scopac timber notes has filed a motion that  if granted  might have the effect of shortening the exclusivity period 
palco and scopac have each engaged the blackstone group blackstone to serve as its financial advisor and assist in the development of a plan of reorganization for each of palco and scopac 
if the debtors fail to file such plan s of reorganization during the exclusivity period or any extension thereof  or such plan s are not accepted by the requisite number of creditors and equity holders entitled to vote on the plan s  other parties in interest in the bankruptcy cases may be permitted to propose their own plan s of reorganization for the debtors 
as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases  operative documents provide that the outstanding principal of  and accrued interest on  all long term debt of the debtors became immediately due and payable 
however  the vast majority of the claims in existence at the filing date including claims for principal and accrued interest on the debtors indebtedness  and substantially all legal proceedings are stayed deferred while the debtors continue to operate the businesses as debtors in possession 
the automatic stay provisions of chapter of the bankruptcy code make it unnecessary to reclassify prepetition long term liabilities as of the filing date even though prepetition creditors might demand payment or there is a violation of a debt covenant in the debt agreement 
accordingly  the debtors long term debt obligations  except for the palco term loan  where the borrowers did not meet the required minimum ebitda maintenance covenant for the three months ended december   have been classified in accordance with their contractual terms in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the bankruptcy court has  however  upon motion by the debtors  permitted the debtors to pay or otherwise honor certain unsecured pre filing date claims  including employee wages and benefits and customary claims in the ordinary course of business  subject to certain limitations 
the debtors also have the right to assume or reject executory contracts  subject to bankruptcy court approval and certain other limitations 
in this context  assumption means that the debtors agree to perform their obligations and cure certain existing defaults under an executory contract and rejection means that the debtors are relieved from their obligations to perform further under an executory contract and are subject only to a claim for damages due to the breach thereof 
any claim for damages resulting from the rejection of an executory contract is treated as a general unsecured claim in the bankruptcy cases 
the debtors anticipate that substantially all liabilities of the debtors as of the filing date will be resolved under one or more plans of reorganization to be proposed and voted on in the bankruptcy cases and in accordance with the provisions of the bankruptcy code 
however  there can be no assurance that the liabilities of the debtors will not be ultimate ly found to exceed the fair value of their assets 
if a debtor s creditors are not paid in full  the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor s equity holder will not be entitled to retain its equity interest  unless certain exceptions apply 
if the liabilities of one or more of the debtors are ultimately found to exceed the fair value of its assets  claims of creditors could be paid at less than of their face value 
in that event  palco could lose all or a material portion of its equity ownership in scopac and palco s other subsidiaries  mgi could lose all or a material portion of its equity ownership in palco  or the value of such equity ownership interests could be diluted  impaired or eliminated 
there is substantial uncertainty as to when the debtors will be able to file such plan s 
moreover  the debtors efforts to obtain approval of such plan s by the creditors and equity holders entitled to vote on the plan s  and to obtain confirmation by the bankruptcy court of such plan s  may not be successful 
the financial information of the debtors contained herein and consolidated with the company s results has been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business  however  as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to a significant number of uncertainties 
specifically  but not all inclusive  the financial information of the debtors for the year ended december   contained herein does not present a the realizable value of assets on a liquidation basis  b the estimated costs and expenses associated with the bankruptcy cases  c the amount that will ultimately be paid to settle liabilities and contingencies which may be allowed in the bankruptcy cases  or d the effect of any changes that may be made in connection with the company s investment in the debtors or with the debtors operations resulting from a plan of reorganization 
because of the ongoing nature of the bankruptcy cases  the discussions and financial information of the debtors contained herein are subject to material uncertainties 
financial difficulties of forest products entities future harvest levels scopac has conducted extensive reviews and analyses of its assets  operations and future prospects 
as a result of these extensive reviews and analyses scopac has concluded that  in the absence of significant regulatory relief and accommodations  its future annual timber harvest levels and cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be substantially below both historical harvest levels and the minimum levels necessary to allow scopac to satisfy the principal and interest payments specified by the scopac indenture 
scopac has estimated that its average annual harvest level over the ten year period that began in is not likely to exceed approximately million board feet per year 
this revised estimated harvest level reflects scopac s further analysis of the cumulative impact of ongoing regulatory limitations  watershed prescriptions  the requirements of the hcp and other matters  and is based on a number of assumptions that may or may not prove to be accurate 
actual harvest levels are expected to vary substantially from year to year 
moreover  the average annual harvest level over the ten year period could be even lower due to  among other things  the various matters discussed elsewhere in this document 
regulatory matters regulatory and environmental matters as well as legal actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant adverse effect on the company s forest products operations and liquidity 
the ability to harvest scopac timber depends in large part upon scopac s ability to obtain regulatory approval of its thps 
scopac has experienced difficulties and delays in the approval of its thps as the result of regulatory and litigation challenges and expects these challenges to persist 
the foregoing matters have resulted in declines in actual and expected harvest levels and cash flows  significant increases in the cost of logging operations and increased costs related to timber harvest litigation  all of which have severely impacted the historical cash flows of both palco and scopac 
these adverse effects are expected to continue 
scopac liquidity as noted above  in the absence of significant regulatory relief and accommodations  scopac s annual timber harvest levels and cash flows from operations will  for the foreseeable future  be substantially below both historical levels and the minimum levels necessary to allow scopac to satisfy the principal and interest payments specified by the scopac indenture 
in an effort to address expected future interest payment shortfalls  scopac in initiated a program to sell certain timberland properties  as well as various non timberland properties  such as ranchlands and recreational areas the scopac land sale program 
the scopac land sale program generated proceeds of million during  however  the proceeds generated from the scopac land sale program  together with other available liquidity  were not sufficient to cover the expected interest payment shortfall on the january   scopac timber notes payment date 
scopac experienced liquidity shortfalls during on the scopac timber notes payment date in january  scopac used its existing cash resources  all of the remaining funds available under the scopac line of credit  and the additional funds made available from a million timber log purchase by mgi  to pay all of the million of interest due million net of interest due in respect of the scopac timber notes held in the sar account 
using funds held in the sar account  scopac also repaid million of principal on the scopac timber notes million net of principal in respect of the scopac timber notes held in the sar account in accordance with scheduled amortization 
scheduled amortization is the amount of principal that scopac must pay on a cumulative basis through any scopac timber notes payment date in order to avoid prepayment or deficiency premiums 
see note  scopac timber notes for further information regarding scheduled amortization 
in april  scopac and mgi consummated a timber log purchase that provided scopac million of additional liquidity to pay its operating expenses 
on the scopac timber notes payment date in july  scopac used its existing cash resources  all of the remaining funds available under the scopac line of credit  million of funds from the scopac land sale program  a million timber log purchase by mgi  and a million early log payment by palco to pay all of the million of interest due million net of interest due in respect of scopac timber notes held in the sar account 
using funds held in the sar account  scopac also repaid million of principal on the scopac timber notes million net of principal in respect of scopac timber notes held in the sar account  an amount equal to scheduled amortization 
as the january scopac timber notes payment date approached  it became apparent to scopac that it would not have sufficient liquidity to make the interest payment 
the failure of scopac to pay all of the interest on the scopac timber notes when due constitutes an event of default under scopac indenture 
in the event of a failure to pay interest on the scopac timber notes in full when due  the trustee under the scopac indenture or the holders of at least of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the scopac timber notes were entitled to cause all principal  interest and other amounts related to the scopac timber notes to become immediately due and payable 
in the event of any such acceleration  the agent under the scopac line of credit was also entitled to accelerate the advances then outstanding thereunder 
if such accelerations of scopac timber notes and or advances under the scopac line of credit were to occur  the trustee would be entitled to exercise all rights under the scopac indenture and related security documents  including applying funds to pay accelerated amounts  and selling the scopac timberlands  scopac timber rights and scopac s other assets and using the proceeds thereof to pay accelerated amounts 
based upon a review of its alternatives under the circumstance and consultation with its legal advisors  on january   scopac elected to file for voluntary protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases  lender claims are stayed deferred while the debtors continue to operate the businesses as debtors in possession 
scopac has been authorized by the bankruptcy court to fund budgeted ongoing operating and bankruptcy related costs using operating cash flow and  to the extent needed  funds available in the sar account subject to no more than million in withdrawals from the sar account being outstanding at any given time 
if these sources of liquidity are not adequate  and if scopac is unable to obtain additional sources of liquidity and the necessary bankruptcy court approval to utilize such additional sources of liquidity  scopac may not be able to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
palco liquidity as of december   and june   palco and britt were in default under the prior palco britt term loan and prior palco britt revolving credit facility the prior palco britt facilities due to financial covenant breaches 
in the first half of  additional liquidity was needed at palco and palco borrowed an aggregate of million from mgi to meet its cash shortfalls 
on july   palco and britt  as borrowers  closed on the palco term loan  a five year million secured term loan  and the palco revolving credit facility  a five year million secured asset based revolving credit facility  and terminated the prior palco britt facilities 
the palco term loan was fully funded at closing 
the palco term loan and the palco revolving credit facility required mgi to provide a million subordinated loan to the borrowers  which was also funded at closing 
the borrowers used approximately million of the palco term loan to pay off the prior palco britt facilities and cash collateralize previously existing letters of credit  and million to pay transaction costs 
the remaining million of loan proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding under the palco term loan  and million of borrowings were outstanding and million of letters of credit were issued under the palco revolving credit facility 
the borrowers did not meet the required minimum ebitda maintenance covenant for the three month period ended september   due to an unplanned severance charge and a legal settlement 
on november   mgi made a loan to palco  enabling the borrowers to exercise their cure right under the two debt facilities 
the borrowers also notified the lenders that changing market conditions and other factors would likely adversely affect the borrowers ability to comply with the financial covenants at december  and in future periods 
the borrowers did not meet the required minimum ebitda maintenance covenant for the three month period ended december  accordingly  the palco term loan has been reclassified as a current liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in january  palco did not have sufficient liquidity to pay all of the interest due on the palco term loan 
based upon a review of its alternatives under the circumstances  and consultation with its legal advisors  in january   palco elected to file for voluntary protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases  lender claims are stayed deferred while the debtors continue to operate the businesses as debtors in possession 
the liquidity shortfalls experienced by palco throughout and resulted primarily from reduced log supply from scopac and operational inefficiencies related to palco s scotia sawmill 
additional liquidity shortfalls are expected in additionally  in  palco initiated an asset sale program palco asset sale program  including real property associated with palco s former fortuna and carlotta sawmills and palco owned homes in scotia  california  with the objective of reducing palco s overall debt levels 
the palco asset sale program did not generate any cash flow in and is not expected to generate liquidity in as  among other things  a substantial portion of the properties must be subdivided and or rezoned before such properties can be sold 
the palco debtors estimate that they will have liquidity shortfalls in the palco debtors are pursuing discussions with lenders in an effort to obtain dip financing in order to have sufficient liquidity to fund the palco debtors ongoing operating cash needs and bankruptcy related costs 
the palco debtors may not be successful in obtaining additional liquidity or the necessary bankruptcy court approval  in which case the palco debtors may not be able to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter of the bankruptcy code

the company does not use derivatives for any of its treasury or risk management activities 
contractual obligations as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases  the operative documents provide that the outstanding principal of  and accrued interest on  all debt obligations became immediately due and payable 
however  the vast majority of the claims in existence at the filing date including claims for principal and accrued interest on the debtors indebtedness and substantially all legal claims are stayed deferred while the debtors continue to operate the businesses as debtors in possession 
the automatic stay provisions of chapter of the bankruptcy code make it unnecessary to reclassify prepetition long term liabilities as of the filing date even though prepetition creditors might demand payment or there is violation of a covenant in the debt agreement 
accordingly  the debtors long term obligations  except for the palco term loan  where the borrowers did not meet the required minimum ebitda maintenance covenant for the three months ended december   have been classified i n accordance with their contractual terms in the company s consolidated financial statements and in the contractual obligations table below

trends forest products operations the forest products operations have become increasingly unpredictable due to regulatory constraints and ongoing litigation challenges and harvest levels have declined significantly 
regulatory and environmental matters as well as legal actions have had and are expected to continue to have a significant adverse effect on the company s forest products operations and liquidity 
these matters have resulted in declines in actual and expected harvest levels and cash flows  significant increases in the cost of logging operations and increased costs related to timber harvest litigation  all of which have severely impacted the historical cash flows of both palco and scopac 
these adverse effects are expected to continue 
additionally  the debtors expect to incur substantial legal and advisor fees as a result of the bankruptcy cases

racing operations the company has in the past and intends to continue to vigorously pursue texas gaming legislation favorable to it 
as some legislation may require the approval of two thirds of each legislative house and a majority of the texas voters  no assurance can be given that any such legislation will be enacted or become effective 
moreover  it is impossible to determine what the provisions of any such legislation would be or its effect on the company 
in january  a subsidiary of the company  laredo llc  applied to the racing commission for an additional license to construct and operate a class horse racing facility in laredo  texas

critical accounting policies and estimates this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see item business general  item a 
risk factors  and below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates due to changed facts  circumstances and conditions 
the following accounting policies and estimates are considered critical in light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on the company s reported financial information 
principles of consolidation under generally accepted accounting principles for entities consolidated through voting interests  consolidation is generally required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these rules  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code under generally accepted accounting principles  entities in reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcy code generally continue to apply the financial reporting principles they applied before filing petitions  accordingly  these consolidated financial statements do not reflect changes in the debtors financial condition that may result from the bankruptcy cases 
the automatic stay provisions of chapter of the bankruptcy code make it unnecessary to reclassify prepetition long term liabilities as of the filing date even though prepetition creditors might demand payment or there is a violation of a covenant in the debt agreement 
additionally  debt discounts  as well as debt issuance costs on debts that are not subject to compromise  such as fully secured claims  should not be adjusted 
accordingly  the debtors long term debt obligations  except for the palco term loan  where the borrowers did not meet the required minimum ebitda maintenance covenant for the three months ended december   have been classified according to their contractual terms in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and there have been no adjustments made to debt discounts or debt issuance costs as a result of the reorganization proceedings 
deconsolidation of kaiser on february   kaiser and certain of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  the company discontinued consolidating kaiser s financial results beginning february   and began reporting its investment in kaiser using the cost method  under which the investment was reflected as a single amount on the company s consolidated balance sheet and the recording of earnings or losses from kaiser was discontinued after february  kaiser s plan of reorganization provided for the cancellation of kaiser s equity  including the company s kaiser shares  without consideration or obligation 
kaiser s plan of reorganization became effective on july   and kaiser emerged from bankruptcy 
as a result  the company no longer has any ownership interest in or affiliation with kaiser 
since the company s kaiser shares were cancelled without obligation  the company reversed the million of losses in excess of its investment in kaiser along with the accumulated other comprehensive losses of million related to kaiser  resulting in a net gain of million  recognized in the third quarter of as a result of the cancellation of the company s kaiser shares in  the company expects it will take a worthless stock deduction on its consolidated federal income tax return 
however  it is uncertain whether the deduction meets certain criteria required for asset recognition purposes 
accordingly  the company has not recorded the resulting tax asset of approximately million in its consolidated balance sheet as of december gain and loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and other proceedings including those discussed in note such matters involve uncertainty as to reasonably possible losses and potential gains the company may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to income estimated losses including related estimated legal fees from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company recognizes gain contingencies when realization is assured 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of gains and losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative and regulatory developments  and other factors 
for larger environmental matters  the company estimates the losses using estimates prepared by third party experts and the advice of internal and external counsel 
risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome of litigation and environmental contingencies 
see note for further discussion of the company s material contingencies 
income taxes the company accrues and charges to income estimated taxes when it is probable at the balance sheet date that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  including situations in which the company has and has not received tax assessments from the relevant taxing authority 
taxes are provided in those instances where the company considers it probable that additional tax may be due in excess of amounts reflected in our tax returns as filed 
the company believes amounts currently provided for any such potential assessments will not be settled within the next twelve months and settlement of such amounts would not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
see note for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of million in valuation allowances and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company has prepaid or for which it will receive a tax benefit an asset or will have to pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that result from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibility between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code 
accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
the need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity of the determination 
projections of future taxable income  by their very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  although they might conceivably be predictable  are far less certain than events that have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of the company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note for further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses estimating future benefit payments for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations requires the company to make a number of assumptions about future experience 
these assumptions are combined with the terms of the company s plans to produce an estimate of required future benefit payments  which is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as a result  assumptions about the covered population demographic assumptions and about the economic environment economic assumptions significantly affect pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the most significant demographic assumptions are expected retirement age  life expectancy  and turnover  while the key economic assumptions are the discount rate  and the expected return on plan assets 
at december   the company s pension plans were frozen 
as a result  these plans will continue  but no additional benefits will accrue to participants subsequent to december  future benefit payments will continue to be measured based on the same types of demographic and economic assumptions  with the exception of salary growth as no new benefits will be accrued 
the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the company s other postretirement benefit plans was determined using a discount rate of at december   and at december  as the pension plans were frozen december   there is no assumed weighted average long term rate of compensation 
the assumed weighted average long term rate of return on the assets of the plans is 
the assets of the plans consist principally of common stocks and us government and other fixed income obligations 
the estimated impact of a decrease in the discount rate from to would increase the company s consolidated projected pension benefit obligation by approximately million  while the estimated impact of a increase in the discount rate from to would decrease the company s consolidated projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
see note for further discussion of the consolidated obligations related t o pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company reviews noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated if the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets  including the possible residual value associated with their eventual disposition  are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upon impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down for impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the need for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
in some instances  situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes in economic conditions or other factors that develop over time  which increases the subjectivity of assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
a probability weighted approach is used for situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
new accounting standards see note for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily under the scopac line of credit and the palco term loan and palco revolving credit facility  as well as certain other debt facilities used to finance real estate development activities 
these facilities bear interest at either the prime interest rate or libor  plus specified percentage point spreads 
the company s objective in maintaining its other variable rate borrowings is flexibility in borrowing funds and making repayments without penalties 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under all variable rate facilities 
based on the amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during  a change in interest rates effective from the beginning of the year would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of million 
all of the company s other debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of higher interest payments due to changes in market interest rates 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps or similar hedging arrangements
