overview core molding technologies is a compounder of sheet molding composite smc and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics 
core molding technologies produces high quality fiberglass reinforced molded products and smc materials for varied markets  including light  medium and heavy duty trucks  automobiles and automotive aftermarkets  personal watercraft  and other commercial products 
the demand for core molding technologies products is affected by economic conditions in the united states  canada  and mexico 
core molding technologies manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core molding technologies operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
on december   core molding technologies acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of international s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late columbus plastics  located in columbus  ohio  was a compounder and compression molder of smc 
in  core molding technologies began compression molding operations at its second facility in gaffney  south carolina  and in october  core molding technologies acquired certain assets of airshield corporation 
as a result of this acquisition  core molding technologies expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray up  hand lay up open mold processes and resin transfer rtm closed mold process 
in september  core molding technologies acquired substantially all the operating assets of keystone restyling products  inc  a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced products for the automotive aftermarket industry

sales to freightliner totaled  for  compared to  for sales to other customers decreased by approximately to  in from  in the decrease in sales was primarily due to the decrease in sales to yamaha due to their decision during the third quarter of to diversify their supplier base 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the primary reason for the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales was due to better absorption of fixed costs of production due to the increases in production volumes 
these gains were partially offset by increased profit sharing amounts resulting from improved profits 
selling  general  and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in the company s profit sharing amounts resulting from increased profits and increases in professional and outside services 
net interest income totaled  in  compared to net interest expense of  in the primary reason for this change was due to interest income of  in compared to  in due to increases in cash balances and the increase in the interest rate earned on those cash balances 
also contributing to the reduction of net interest expense was capitalized interest in of approximately  relating to the columbus plant expansion  as well as a reduction in debt from regularly scheduled principal payments 
there was no capitalized interest recorded in interest rates experienced by core molding technologies with respect to its long term borrowing facilities were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swaps core molding technologies entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed for these debt instruments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes compared to approximately in the decrease is primarily due to the company qualifying for certain manufacturing production activity deductions for its us manufacturing facilities under section of the internal revenue code 
these deductions are now available to the company as it has utilized all net operating loss carryforwards

table of contents addition of the batavia  ohio facility acquired in august sales to international totaled  an approximate increase from the amount of  the primary reason for the increase was due to the positive impact of general economic conditions and the affect on product sales 
sales to freightliner totaled  for  which was an increase of approximately from the  for the primary reason for the increase was due to the positive impact general economic conditions have had on the demand for medium and heavy duty trucks and having the full effect of products that went into production in the fourth quarter of sales to paccar in totaled  an approximate increase from the amount of  the primary reason for the increase in sales to paccar is due to the addition of the batavia  ohio facility 
sales to other customers decreased by approximately to  in from  in the primary reasons for this decrease were due to the decision by yamaha to diversify its supplier base and lower sales to lear reflecting lower demand for sport utility vehicles 
partially offsetting this decrease was the full year sales impact of core molding technologies automotive aftermarket division  which was acquired in september of  and new customers at core molding technologies matamoros facility 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales from the prior year  was due to a combination of many factors 
the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to production efficiencies related to labor and material usage 
increases in production volumes also added to the increased gross margin for the current year  as core molding technologies was better able to absorb its fixed cost of production 
the benefit gained in gross margin was partially offset by increases in raw material and energy costs as well as increases in the company s profit sharing amounts resulting from improved profits 
selling  general  and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in labor costs  certain employee benefits and the company s profit sharing amounts resulting from improved profits 
net interest expense totaled  in  decreasing from  in the primary reasons for this decrease were due to interest income of  in compared to  in  as well as  a reduction in debt from regularly scheduled principal payments 
interest rates experienced by core molding technologies with respect to its long term borrowing facilities were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swaps core molding technologies entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed for these debt instruments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes compared to in the increase is primarily due to the company eliminating its valuation reserve in related to its tax operating loss carryforwards 
this reserve was reduced by  as a result of the company anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
actual tax payments will be lower than the recorded expenses as the company has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  the company reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense 
the company used all federal tax loss carryforwards in net income for was  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  representing an increase of  from the net income of  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share 
included in net income was a one time benefit of  or 
per basic and diluted share  resulting from the company eliminating its valuation reserve related to its tax operating loss carryforward 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds have been cash generated from operating activities and borrowings from third parties 
the company s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital in totaled  changes in working capital increased cash provided by operating activities by  to  net income contributed  to operating cash flows 
non cash deductions of depreciation and amortization contributed  to operating cash flow 
the decrease in deferred income taxes also had a positive impact on operating cash flows of  which is a result of core molding technologies depreciation timing differences reducing current year tax obligations 
in addition  the increase in the postretirement healthcare benefits liability of  is not a current cash obligation  and this item will not be a cash obligation until retirees begin to utilize their retirement medical benefits 

table of contents cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december  capital expenditures totaled  which was primarily related to an expansion of the columbus plant  equipment lease buyouts  and the acquisition of machinery and equipment at production facilities 
at december   commitments for capital expenditures in progress were  capital expenditures for are expected to be  primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
financing activities reduced cash flow by  core molding technologies made principal repayments on its existing bank note payable of  and regularly scheduled payments on its industrial revenue bond of  partially offsetting these payments were proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise  by core molding employees and directors  of  stock options and  of favorable tax benefit related to disqualified disposition received from the exercise of stock options 
at december   the company had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  line of credit  which is scheduled to mature on april  at december   core molding technologies had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
management expects these resources to be adequate to meet core molding technologies liquidity needs 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its two financial debt covenants for the line of credit and letter of credit securing the industrial revenue bond and certain equipment leases 
the covenants relate to maintaining certain financial ratios 
management expects core molding technologies to meet these covenants for the year however  if a material adverse change in the financial position of core molding technologies should occur  core molding technologies liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for chargebacks such as customer returns  customer rework chargebacks  discounts offered to customers  and price adjustments 
should these customer returns  chargebacks  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company has reduced accounts receivable for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities below the assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers 
allowances for returned products and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized 
tooling revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership 
progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet 
income taxes 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and has not recorded a valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its three largest customers international  paccar  and freightliner  and the company s recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of the deferred tax asset of  at december   primarily includes temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s property and equipment of approximately  and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of labor  equipment  and raw materials 
due to the cost of crude oil and natural gas  raw material prices have increased and may continue to rise in these increases could have a significant impact on the future results of operations
