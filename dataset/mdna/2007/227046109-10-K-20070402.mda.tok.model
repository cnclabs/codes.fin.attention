the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a rapidly growing designer  manufacturer  and marketer of footwear for men  women  and children 
all of our footwear products incorporate croslite  which enables us to produce a soft and lightweight  non marking  slip and odor resistant shoe that retails at attractive price points ranging from to 
in addition to our footwear products  we recently acquired jibbitz a unique accessory brand with colorful snap on products specifically suited for crocs shoes and introduced a line of crocs branded apparel and accessory items 
we also recently acquired fury  which produces and distributes hockey and lacrosse equipment for adults and children  and exo  a italian designer and producer of eva ethylene vinyl acetate based finished products  primarily for the footwear industry 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of ocean minded  a leading designer and manufacture of high quality leather and eva based sandals primarily for the beach  adventure and action sports market 
we also use croslite to manufacture non branded products that we sell to original equipment manufacturers 
we currently sell our crocs branded products throughout the us and in over countries worldwide 
outside the us  we sell our products directly to retailers or through distributors where we believe they offer a preferable alternative to direct sales 
we also sell directly to consumers through our website and our company operated kiosks and retail stores 
the broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products to a wide range of distribution channels in the us  including traditional footwear retailers as well as a variety of specialty channels 
as of december   our retail customer base in the us included over  sales locations selling our products 
we have achieved significant growth since our inception  driven largely by the popularity of our footwear products and our ability to significantly expand the breadth and depth of our distribution network 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of million and net income of million  compared to million of revenues and net income of million for the year ended december  we have achieved strong gross profit margins on sales of our crocs footwear 
for the year ended december   our gross profit was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  we believe a number of factors have contributed to our ability to achieve gross profit margins at these levels 
generally  we have not discounted the sale price of our crocs footwear due to high levels of demand for our products 
additionally  our use of third party manufacturers as well as company operated manufacturing facilities has allowed us to maintain a relatively low cost structure while enabling us to achieve significant production flexibility 
we currently manufacture some of our footwear products and accessories  and all non branded products for original equipment manufacturers at foam creations facility in quebec city  canada 
we also manufacture our footwear products at our company owned and operated facilities located in mexico and italy 
in addition  we contract with third party manufacturers in china  romania and the united states for the production of our footwear products and accessories 
we believe our in house production capabilities enable us to make rapid changes to manufacturing schedules and provide us the flexibility to quickly ship in demand models and colors  while outsourcing allows us to lower our capital investment and retain the cost effectiveness of using third party manufacturing 
on february   we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in which we sold  shares and our selling shareholders sold  shares 
our net proceeds from the offering totaled approximately million  after payment of underwriters commissions and offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our amended and restated credit facility and amounts outstanding under foam creations loans from the national bank of canada and for capital expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and infrastructure improvements as well as to develop our international operations and increase our marketing activities 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling shareholders 
in august  we completed a secondary offering of our common stock in which existing stockholders  including certain members of the company s management  sold  shares 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares sold in the offering 
we incurred expenses from the offering 
general revenues are recorded when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of related receivables are probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
allowances for estimated returns and discounts are recognized when related revenue is recorded 
because we use both internal manufacturing and contract with third parties to manufacture our products  our cost of sales represents our costs to manufacture products in our own facilities  including raw materials costs and all overhead expenses related to production  as well as the cost to purchase finished products from our third party manufacturers 
cost of sales also includes the cost to transport these products to our facilities and all warehouse and outbound freight expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of selling  marketing  wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs  travel and insurance expenses  depreciation  amortization  professional fees  facility expenses  bank charges and non cash charges for stock based compensation 
we were initially organized as a limited liability company and until january  were treated as a partnership for us federal and state income tax purposes for each of the tax years ended december  and under us tax law  partnerships are treated as pass through entities and are not subject to direct taxation 
however  partners are subject to income tax on their allocable share of the partnership s income 
on january   we converted from a limited liability company to a taxable corporation 
for tax years beginning on january  and afterward  we have been subject to corporate level us federal  state and foreign income taxes 
factors affecting comparability set forth below are selected factors that we believe have had  or are expected to have  a significant affect on the comparability of recent or future results of operations stock based compensation expenses in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which requires the calculation of the fair value of stock based compensation  estimation of future forfeitures and income taxes  and recognition of the fair value as a non cash expense over the vesting period of the underlying instruments 
sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the footnote disclosure only provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and instead requires that such transactions be recognized and reflected in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
we adopted sfas r effective as of january  using the prospective method for option grants and restricted stock issued prior to august   which was the date we filed our initial registration statement on form s in connection with our initial public offering and the modified prospective method for option grants issued after august  the adoption of the sfas r fair value based method had a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash flow 
the effect of applying sfas r for the year ending december  was a decrease of million of pre tax income 
we recognized additional stock based compensation expense in based on the fair value of any share based payments made in the amount of compensation expense recognized depends on numerous factors and estimates  including the number and vesting period of option grants  the publicly traded price of our common stock  estimated volatility of the stock price  estimates of the timing and volume of exercises and forfeitures of the options  and fluctuations in future interest and income tax rates 
effects of initial public offering in february  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
as a part of the initial public offering  we issued  shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the initial public offering  all of our then outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock  which was not included in stockholders equity in our balance sheet  converted into  shares of our common stock  of which a portion was sold in our initial public offering  and accrued dividends aggregating  were paid with a portion of our net proceeds from the offering 
in addition  the put options on our redeemable shares of common stock terminated and such shares were also not previously included in stockholders equity in our balance sheet 
therefore  the immediate result of our initial public offering was a significant increase in cash and stockholders equity on our balance sheet  and the elimination of the accrual of dividends on the preferred stock 
in addition  our common stock outstanding increased significantly because of the conversion of the preferred stock  the termination of the put options on the redeemable shares of common stock and our issuance of shares of common stock 
as a result  the basis for the calculation of net income per share on both a basic and diluted basis has changed significantly 
acquisitions in september we entered into an endorsement agreement with jibbitz providing that we would publicly endorse the products of jibbitz and license to jibbitz certain company trademarks 
we allowed jibbitz to access our network of distribution and retailers as well as utilize our warehousing and logistics infrastructure 
we acquired jibbitz on december  with an aggregate purchase price of million  which included  in costs related to the acquisition 
the cash purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the closing date balance sheet of jibbitz  to be agreed on by both parties in the second quarter of the consolidated financial statements referred to in this report reflect the acquisition of jibbitz as of december   the date of acquisition 
in october  we acquired for million and million approximately million  fury and exo  respectively  as part of the company s effort to expand into new markets and expand our internal design capabilities 
the consolidated financial statements referred to in this report reflect the acquisitions of fury and exo as of the date of acquisition 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of significantly higher unit sales of our footwear products 
the higher unit sales resulted from an increase in the number of retail stores selling our products  additional sales resulting from new product offerings  stronger sales to our existing wholesale customers and increases in sales at retail locations owned by us and through our webstore 
in addition  our revenues from sales outside of the united states were million for the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  we expect our sales to continue to grow as we enter new domestic and international markets and introduce new products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  due primarily to higher revenues 
our gross profit margin improved to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december  we do not consider this to be a material change 
during  we increased the percentage of orders shipped factory direct reducing average order fulfillment costs 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in margin related to product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  including an increase in selling and marketing expenses of million  increases in personnel expenses of million due to our growth and expanding operations 
in addition  professional and consulting fees increased approximately million  primarily as a result of increased legal fees related to our secondary offering and defending our intellectual property  accounting  contract labor and consultants 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december   primarily due to the effect of the improved leverage of operating expenses resulting from higher sales 
interest expense 
interest expense was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  interest expense decreased due to our use of a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering to retire bank loans 
this debt retirement led to a decrease in average borrowings outstanding on our line of credit and long term debt during the year ended december  compared to average borrowings outstanding under those arrangements during the year ended december  other income expense  net 
other income was million in the year ended december   compared to income of  in the year ended december  the increase resulted from an increase in interest income related to an increase in interest bearing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from proceeds received upon completion of our initial public offering in february income tax expense 
in the year ended december   income tax expense was million  representing an effective income tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of million in the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of 
the decrease relates primarily to an increase in the pre tax earnings in jurisdictions with lower relative income tax rates as a percentage of total pre tax earnings 
dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
dividends on our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  our class c membership units  issued in june  had preferred liquidation and dividend rights 
in connection with our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation  our class c membership units converted into shares of our series a preferred stock 
our series a preferred stock provided for a dividend at the rate of five percent per annum on the initial investment amount per share 
all of our series a preferred stock converted into shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of the initial public offering on february  comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of significantly higher unit sales of our footwear products  which increased to million pairs for the year ended december   from  pairs for the year ended december  the higher unit sales resulted from an increase to  retail stores domestically and internationally selling our products and stronger sales to our existing customers 
during the year ended december   our results included revenues of million from sales by foam creations 
revenues from sales by foam creations that were included in our results of operations for the date of acquisition to december  were million 
in addition  our revenues from sales outside of the united states were million in the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit increased million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our gross profit margin improved to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower unit costs resulting from the addition of a third party manufacturer located in china  partially offset by higher freight and duty costs  from which we did not obtain footwear products in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  including an increase in selling and marketing expenses of million  increases in personnel expenses of million 
in addition  professional and consulting fees increased approximately million  primarily as a result of increased legal fees  as well as settlement costs with consultants 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december   primarily due to substantially higher revenues in interest expense 
interest expense was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  the increase is related to the interest expense associated with the indebtedness incurred under our line of credit during and the long term debt at our subsidiary foam creations  which we acquired in june other income expense  net 
other income was  in the year ended december   compared to expense of  in the year ended december   which primarily related to a minority interest associated with foam creations  which was acquired in june and an increase in interest income related to the increase in cash and cash equivalents 
income tax expense benefit 
in the year ended december   income tax expense was million  representing an effective income tax rate of  compared to a benefit of  in the year ended december  in the year ended december   we were not a tax paying entity for us income tax purposes and therefore did not record any income tax expense for the us entity for this period 
however  we acquired foam creations  a canadian corporation  in june during the period subsequent to the acquisition  foam creations recorded a tax benefit of  we recognized a tax benefit of  in the year ended december  to establish our deferred tax assets in connection with the conversion from a limited liability company to a taxable corporation 
dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
dividends on our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  our class c membership units  issued in june  had preferred liquidation and dividend rights 
in connection with our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation  our class c membership units converted into shares of our series a preferred stock 
our series a preferred stock provided for a dividend at the rate of five percent per annum on the initial investment amount per share 
all of our series a preferred stock converted into shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of the initial public offering on february  liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
other principal uses of cash have been for the distribution in april of million in cash to the members of our predecessor limited liability company pursuant to its operating agreement  for the purchase of our manufacturing operation in mexico and associated operating assets in april for approximately million  and for capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity and improve our global infrastructure 
prior to our initial public offering  we generally financed these needs through sales of our securities  borrowings under our credit facility and cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments compared to million as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects the completion of our initial public offering of our common stock in february whereby we received proceeds of million  net of underwriters fees and commissions and related offering costs of million 
to date  we have used million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay down our revolving line of credit and long term debt  million of the net proceeds for capital expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our infrastructure  million to expand and upgrade our existing information technology systems and million for acquisitions  net of cash received 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for the continual development of our global infrastructure  facility upgrades  working capital  and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  we may use a portion of the remaining proceeds to acquire products or businesses that are complimentary to our own 
the significant components of our working capital are cash  accounts receivable and inventory  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
capital requirements related to manufacturing include compounding and injection molding equipment for facilities we operate  as well as footwear molds used in facilities operated by us or purchased for our third party manufacturers 
cash provided by  or used in  operating activities consists primarily of net income or net loss adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  provision for bad debts  stock compensation expense and for the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily related to net income of million plus non cash items of depreciation and amortization of million and share based compensation expense of million  which was offset by increases in working capital resulting from increases in accounts receivable of million  inventory of million  and a increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was million and was primarily related to net income of million plus non cash items of depreciation and amortization of million and share based compensation expense of million  partially offset by increases in working capital resulting from significant increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  inventory of million and accounts receivable of million offset by increases in accounts payable of million and accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  all related to our sales growth and expanded operations 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  which was related to the net purchases of investments of million  capital expenditures for molds  machinery and equipment of million and million related to the upgrade and expansion of our information technology systems 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  which was related to capital expenditures for molds  machinery and equipment of million and  related to the acquisition of a non compete agreement 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the million increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock whereby we received net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of million  all partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on our line of credit and long term debt of million 
on april  we entered into a million secured revolving credit facility  and on october  we amended and restated the credit facility increasing the amount available under this credit facility to million 
the effective annual interest rate  on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility was as of december  our obligations under the revolving credit facility were secured by substantially all of our property  including  among other things  our accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and fixtures 
the credit facility also contained financial covenants that required us to meet a specified consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and specified levels of consolidated ebitda 
the credit facility was subject to an early termination fee of if we terminated the facility on or prior to october  in february  we terminated the credit facility and repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facility  together with accrued interest thereon  with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering  and we are no longer able to borrow against the facility 
we have considered our anticipated operating cash flows in  cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and access to capital markets and believes that these are sufficient to fund our operating needs  including commitments and contingencies  capital and investing commitments for at least the next twelve months 
any future acquisitions or other similar transactions may require additional capital 
there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years additional purchase price related to exo capital lease obligations operating lease obligations corporate sponsorship purchase obligations contractual severance commitment total excluded from the table above is the contingent cash purchase price of up to million for jibbitz  related to the earn out provisions of the agreement  see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
seasonality due to our significant sales growth since our inception  we cannot assess with certainty the degree to which sales of our footwear products will be subject to seasonality 
however  we expect that our business  similar to other vendors of footwear and related merchandise  will be subject to seasonal variation 
we believe many vendors that market footwear products suited for warm weather normally experience their highest sales activity during the second and third quarters of the calendar year 
while we have introduced footwear models that are more suitable for cold weather uses  such as the endeavor  georgie  all terrain  highland and snowmini  we expect demand for our products  and therefore our sales  may be subject to seasonal variations and significantly impacted by weather conditions  as over of our revenues during the year ended december  were attributable to our beach and cayman classic models and our flip flops and other open toed models  which are more suitable for warm weather 
in addition  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new model introductions or general economic or consumer conditions 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and revenues for any particular period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  intangible assets  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventories  share based compensation and goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived principally from wholesale sales to retailers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the arrangement with the customer 
allowances for estimated returns and claims are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
since inception  actual returns and claims have not exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual returns and claims exceed reserves  we would need to reduce our revenues at the time of such determination 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of some of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory write downs 
we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this write down is recorded to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our write down in the period in which we made such a determination and record it to cost of sales 
share based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas r which requires recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation over the vesting period of the option 
we adopted the prospective method for all stock option grants issued prior to august   which was the date we initially filed a registration statement on form s in connection with our initial public offering 
as a non public company we used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
we continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards which were the provisions of apb and its related interpretive guidance 
for stock option grants issued after the filing of our initial registration statement on form s on august   we have applied the modified prospective method 
under this method we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options  which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility  the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates 
the volatility assumptions were derived from our historical volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets 
had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different 
goodwill and other intangible asset valuation 
we classify intangible assets as finite lived or indefinite lived intangible assets  as well as goodwill 
finite lived intangibles include customer relationships  core technology  capitalized software  patents and non compete agreements 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the amortization periods related to our definite lived assets 
these assets are stated at cost 
indefinite lived intangibles include tradenames 
the excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired is classified as goodwill 
the indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are not subject to amortization  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we test for possible impairment of finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a reduction in operating cash flow or a dramatic change in the manner that the asset is intended to be used indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows related to the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flow amount  an impairment charge is recorded in the statement of operations for amounts necessary to reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
at least annually  we perform our impairment test for each reporting unit s indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill using a discounted cash flow model to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit  including indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill  is less than the fair value of the reporting unit 
certain assumptions are used in determining the fair value  including assumptions about cash flow rates  discount rates  and terminal values 
if the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  an impairment charge is recorded in the statement of operations for amounts necessary to reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
acquisitions 
we account for business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
these estimates and assumptions affect future amortization expense and gains or losses recorded on the sale of properties 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf no 
 which states a company must disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue 
if taxes included in gross revenues are significant  a company must disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented 
the issue is effective for the first annual or interim reporting period beginning after december  the disclosures are required for annual and interim financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented 
we adopted this issue effective january  based on the our current evaluation of this issue  we do not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of initially adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized on adoption of fin the company adopted fin on january   and we are still in the process of evaluating this interpretation 
we expect that the requirements of fin may add volatility to our effective tax rate and therefore our expected income tax expense in future periods 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for the first annual or interim reporting period beginning after november  we will adopt sfas effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
on september   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a potential current year misstatement 
prior to sab  companies could evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements using either the income statement or balance sheet approach  with the income statement approach focusing on new misstatements added in the current year  and the balance sheet approach focusing on the cumulative amount of misstatement present in a company s balance sheet 
misstatements that would be material under one approach could be viewed as immaterial under another approach  and not be corrected 
sab now requires companies to view financial statement misstatements as material if they are material according to either the income statement or balance sheet approach 
the bulletin is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  we adopted sab for the fiscal year ending december  the adoption of sab did not to have a significant impact our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas will be effective at the beginning of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we earn interest income on both our cash and cash equivalents and our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio generally consists of readily marketable investment grade debt securities of various issuers and maturities 
all investments are denominated in us dollars and are classified as available for sale
