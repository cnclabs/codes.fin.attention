item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
the report and order requires us to make a payment to the us treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the ghz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum positions in the mhz and mhz bands that we surrendered under the decision  plus the actual costs that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities under the report and order 
the fcc determined under the report and order that  for purposes of calculating that payment amount  the value of the ghz spectrum is about billion and the aggregate value of the mhz spectrum and the mhz spectrum surrendered  net of mhz spectrum received as part of the exchange  is about billion  which  because of the potential payment to the us treasury  results in minimum cash expenditures of about billion by us under the report and order 
the fcc has designated an independent transition administrator to monitor  facilitate and review our expenditures for mhz band reconfiguration 
a precise methodology for evaluating and confirming our internal network costs has not yet been established by the ta 
because the ta may not agree that all of the costs we submit as external and internal costs are appropriate or are subject to credit  we may incur certain costs as part of the reconfiguration process for which we will not receive credit against the potential payment to the us treasury 
we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed billion 
as of december   we estimate that we had incurred about million of costs directly attributable to the reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any indirect network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program 
as required under the terms of the report and order  we delivered a billion letter of credit to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
although the report and order provides for the possibility of periodic reductions in the amount of the letter of credit  we have not requested any reductions as of december  in addition  a financial reconciliation is required to be completed at the end of the reconfiguration implementation to determine whether the value of the spectrum rights received exceeds the total of i the value of spectrum rights that are surrendered and ii the qualifying costs referred to above 
if so  we will be required to pay the difference to the us treasury  as described above 
as a result of the uncertainty with regard to the calculation of the credit for our internal network costs  as well as the significant number of variables outside of our control  particularly with regard to the mhz reconfiguration licensee costs  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate what amount  if any  will be paid to the us treasury 
new spectrum opportunities and spectrum auctions we are a non voting  minority shareholder in a consortium called spectrumco llc  which was recently awarded numerous advanced wireless services  or aws  licenses in the ghz ghz bands 
aws licensees such as spectrumco have no fcc build out or active spectrum management requirements until they are required to demonstrate substantial service at the end of their fifteen year license terms 
separately  several fcc proceedings and initiatives are underway that may affect the availability of spectrum used or useful in the provision of commercial wireless services  which may allow new competitors to enter the wireless market 
for instance  federal law requires the fcc to commence auction of sixty megahertz in the mhz spectrum band for commercial use no later than january we cannot predict when or whether the fcc will conduct any spectrum auctions or if it will release additional spectrum that might be useful to wireless carriers  including us  in the future 
services pursuant to fcc rules  cmrs providers  including us  are required to provide enhanced  or e  services in a two tiered manner 
phase i requires wireless carriers to transmit to a requesting public safety answering point  or psap  both a the caller s telephone number and b the location of the cell site from which the call is being made 
phase ii requires the transmission of more accurate location information using latitude and longitude  and  with respect to our iden and cdma network services  such information can be determined only if the caller is using a handset with global positioning satellite  or gps  capability 
implementation of phase i or phase ii e service must be completed within six months of a psap request for service in its area  or longer  based on the agreement between the individual psap and carrier 
we were unable to satisfy the fcc requirement that of our iden subscriber base have assisted gps capable handsets by december  the fcc recently denied our request for an extension of this deadline and has referred the matter to the fcc s enforcement bureau for further action 
although we have asked the fcc to reconsider their decision  the fcc may impose fines  set new deadlines for compliance or seek to require us to take actions to encourage our customers to upgrade their handsets so we can fulfill the requirement 
truth in billing and consumer protection the fcc s truth in billing rules generally require cmrs licensees  such as us  to provide full and fair disclosure of all charges on their wireless bills  including brief  clear  and non misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided 
in response to a petition from the national association of state utility consumer advocates  the fcc found that state regulation of cmrs rates  including line items on consumer bills  is preempted by federal statute 
this decision was overturned by the th circuit court of appeals  however  and many states continue to attempt to impose various regulations on the billing practices of wireless carriers 
the fcc is continuing to look at issues of consumer protection and the appropriate state and federal roles 
if states gain such authority  or there are other changes in the truth in billing rules  our billing and customer service costs could increase 
homeland security homeland security issues are receiving attention at the fcc  from the states and in congress 
the fcc chairman has created a new fcc bureau devoted to this area 
we expect that increased scrutiny of wireless carriers networks and several new initiatives could lead to new regulatory requirements regarding disaster preparedness  network reliability  and communications among first responders 
in october  congress passed the warning  alert and response network act  or warn act  which created a new voluntary wireless emergency alert program 
as a result of the warn act  the fcc created the commercial mobile service alert advisory committee to recommend standards and protocols for delivery of emergency alerts to wireless customers 
we are unable to predict the impact of these initiatives on our business 
tower siting wireless systems must comply with various federal  state and local regulations that govern the siting  lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas  including requirements imposed by the fcc and the federal aviation administration 
fcc rules subject certain cell site locations to extensive zoning  environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties  including native americans 
the fcc adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects  which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities 
the fcc is also considering changes to its rules regarding environmental protection as related to tower constructions  which  if adopted  could make it more difficult to deploy facilities 
to the extent governmental agencies impose additional requirements on the tower siting process  the time and cost to construct cell towers could be negatively impacted 
state and local regulation while the communications act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating entry of  or the rates charged by  wireless carriers  certain state pucs and local governments regulate customer billing  termination of service arrangements  advertising  certification of operation  use of handsets when driving  service quality  sales practices  management of customer call records and protected information and many other areas 
also  some state attorneys general have become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers 
states also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers  similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the fcc 
we anticipate that these trends will continue 
it will require us to devote legal and other resources to working with the states to respond to their concerns while minimizing  if not preventing  any new regulation and enforcement actions that could increase our costs of doing business 
regulation and wireline operations competitive local service the telecommunications act of  or telecom act  the first comprehensive update of the communications act  was designed to promote competition  and it eliminated legal and regulatory barriers for entry into local and long distance communications markets 
it also required ilecs to allow resale of specified local services at wholesale rates  negotiate interconnection agreements  provide nondiscriminatory access to unbundled network elements  or unes  and allow co location of interconnection equipment by competitors 
the rules implementing the telecom act remain subject to legal challenges 
thus  the scope of future local competition remains uncertain 
these local competition rules impact us because we provide wholesale services to cable television companies that wish to compete in the local voice telephony market 
we provide cable companies with communications and back office services to enable the cable companies to provide competitive local and long distance telephony services primarily in a voice over ip  or voip  format to their end user customers 
we are now providing these cable services in a number of states while working to gain regulatory approvals and obtain interconnection agreements to enter additional markets 
certain ilecs continue to take steps to impede our ability to provide services to the cable companies in an efficient manner 
however  regulatory decisions in several states may speed our market entry in those states 
voice over internet protocol with the increasing availability of voip services  the fcc continues to consider the regulatory status of various forms of voip 
in  the fcc issued an order finding that one form of voip  involving a specific form of computer to computer services for which no charge is assessed and conventional telephone numbers are not used  is an unregulated information service  rather than a telecommunications service  and preempted state regulation of this service 
the fcc also ruled that long distance offerings in which calls begin and end on the ordinary public switched telephone network  but are transmitted in part through the use of ip  are telecommunications services  thereby rendering the services subject to all the regulatory obligations imposed on ordinary long distance services  including payment of access charges and contributions to the universal service funds or usf 
in addition  the fcc preempted states from exercising entry and related economic regulation of interconnected volp services that originate through the use of broadband connections and specialized customer premises equipment 
however  this ruling did not address specifically whether this form of voip is an information service or a telecommunications service  or what regulatory obligations  such as intercarrier compensation  should apply 
nevertheless  the fcc requires interconnected voip providers to contribute to the federal usf 
the fcc also requires interconnected voip providers to offer e emergency calling capabilities to their subscribers 
high speed internet access services following a june us supreme court decision affirming the fcc s classification of cable modem internet access service as an information service and declining to impose mandatory common carrier regulation on cable providers  the fcc issued an order in september declaring the wireline high speed internet access services  which are provided by ilecs  are information services rather than telecommunications services 
as a result  over time ilecs have been relieved of certain obligations regarding the provision of the underlying broadband transmission services 
the fcc is considering similar deregulation of wireless high speed internet access services 
such deregulation could result in less regulation of some of our ev do and wimax products and services 
deregulation of broadband services has sparked a debate over net neutrality 
proponents of net neutrality assert that operators of broadband transmission facilities should not be permitted to make distinctions among content providers for priority access to the underlying facilities 
a net neutrality mandate could adversely affect the operation of our networks that utilize ev do and wimax technologies by constraining our ability to control the network and enter into innovative business arrangements with third party content providers 
additionally  the fcc has a pending proceeding to consider whether all high speed internet access services  regardless of the technology used  are subject to various fcc consumer protection regulations 
the imposition of any such obligations could result in significant costs to us 
other regulations access charge reform and universal service requirements incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  and other carriers impose access charges for the origination and termination of long distance calls upon wireless and long distance carriers  including our wireless and long distance segments 
also  interconnected local carriers  including our wireless segment  pay to each other reciprocal compensation fees for terminating interconnected local calls 
in addition  ilecs impose special access charges for their provision of dedicated facilities to other carriers  including both our long distance and wireless segments 
these fees and charges are a significant cost for our wireless and long distance segments 
there are ongoing proceedings at the fcc related to access charges and special access rates  which could impact our costs for these services 
communications carriers also pay fees into and receive revenues from the usf  established by the fcc and many states 
the federal usf program funds services provided in high cost areas  reduced rate services to low income consumers  and discounted communications and internet services for schools  libraries and rural health care facilities 
the usf is funded from assessments on communications providers  including our wireless and long distance segments  who must make contributions into the fund 
our contributions to the federal usf are based on separate fcc prescribed percentages of our interstate and international end user revenues from telecommunications services for our wireless and long distance segments 
the fcc is considering changing the interstate revenue based assessment with an assessment based on telephone numbers or connections to the public network  which could impact the amount of our assessments 
as permitted  we assess customers for these usf charges 
the fcc is considering changing the way it distributes federal usf support to carriers 
in particular  fcc or state actions could make it more difficult for our wireless segment  which currently receives support in states as an eligible telecommunications carrier  or etc  to qualify for and to receive support 
further restrictions on our etc status at the federal and state levels could result in the rescission of our etc status 
calea requirements the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea  requires telecommunications carriers  including us  to modify equipment  facilities and services to allow for authorized electronic surveillance based on either industry or fcc standards 
our calea obligations have been extended to data and voip networks  with which we are required to be compliant by may privacy related regulations we comply with fcc mandated rules that limit how carriers may use customer proprietary network information  or cpni  for marketing purposes  and specify what carriers must do to safeguard cpni held by third parties 
it has recently been reported that the call detail records of both wireline and wireless telephone customers are available from certain internet based vendors 
congress has enacted  and state legislatures are considering  legislation to criminalize the sale of call detail records and to further restrict the manner in which carriers make such information available 
the fcc is investigating these practices and is examining whether existing regulations with respect to cpni require revision or expansion  which could result in additional costs to us  including administrative or operational burdens on our customer care  sales  marketing and it systems 
environmental compliance our environmental compliance and remediation obligations relate primarily to the operation of standby power generators  batteries and fuel storage for our telecommunications equipment 
these obligations require compliance with storage and related standards  obtaining of permits and occasional remediation 
although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations  we do not believe that any such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified seven former manufactured gas plant sites in nebraska  not currently owned or operated by us  that may have been owned or operated by entities acquired by centel corporation  formerly a subsidiary of ours and now a subsidiary of embarq 
we and embarq have agreed to share the environmental liabilities arising from these former manufactured gas plant sites 
three of the sites are part of ongoing settlement negotiations and administrative consent orders with the environmental protection agency  or epa 
two of the sites have had initial site assessments conducted by the nebraska department of environmental quality  or ndeq  but no regulatory actions have followed 
the two remaining sites have had no regulatory action by the epa or the ndeq 
centel has entered into agreements with other potentially responsible parties to share costs in connection with five of the seven sites 
we are working to assess the scope and nature of these sites and our potential responsibility  which is not expected to be material 
patents  trademarks and licenses we own numerous patents  patent applications  service marks and trademarks in the united states and other countries 
we have a program to file applications for trademarks  service marks and patents where we believe this protection is appropriate 
sprint  power vision  sprint pcs  nextel and boost mobile are among our trademarks 
our services often use the intellectual property of others  such as licensed software  and we often license copyrights  patents and trademarks of others 
in total  these licenses and our copyrights  patents  trademarks and service marks are of material importance to the business 
generally  our trademarks and service marks endure and are enforceable so long as they continue to be used 
our patents and licensed patents have remaining terms generally ranging from one to years 
we occasionally license our intellectual property to others  including licenses to others to use the trademarks sprint and nextel 
we have received claims in the past  and may in the future receive claims  that we  or third parties from whom we license intellectual property  have infringed on the intellectual property of others 
these claims can be time consuming and costly to defend  and divert management resources 
if these claims are successful  we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services  or the third parties from whom we license intellectual property could be forced to pay significant damages  which could increase the cost of these products and services or force the third parties to stop providing certain products or services to us 
we also could enter into licenses with unfavorable terms  including royalty payments  which could adversely affect our business 
employee relations as of december   we had about  employees  representing a reduction of about  employees since december   due primarily to the spin off of embarq 
in connection with the ongoing merger and integration cost rationalization projects  which began in the second half of  we continue to align our internal resources to achieve synergies from the sprint nextel merger and the acquisitions of the pcs affiliates and nextel partners 
in january  we announced that we would be reducing our workforce 
we expect to complete the majority of the reductions in the first quarter management for information concerning our executive officers  see executive officers of the registrant in this document 
information as to business segments for information regarding our business segments  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and also refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us 
our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
risks related to the sprint nextel merger and the spin off of embarq we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of nextel  the acquired pcs affiliates or nextel partners with ours and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and acquisitions 
we continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the nextel wireless network and other wireless technologies with ours  as well as the business practices  operations and support functions of the two companies 
the challenges we are facing and or may face in the future in connection with these integration efforts include the following integrating our cdma and iden wireless networks  which operate on different technology platforms and use different spectrum bands  and developing wireless devices and other products and services that operate seamlessly on both technology platforms  developing and deploying next generation wireless technologies  combining and simplifying diverse product and service offerings  subscriber plans and sales and marketing approaches  preserving subscriber  supplier and other important relationships  consolidating and integrating duplicative facilities and operations  including back office systems  and addressing differences in business cultures  preserving employee morale and retaining key employees  while maintaining focus on providing consistent  high quality customer service and meeting our operational and financial goals 
the process of integrating nextel s operations with ours has caused  and may in the future cause  interruptions of  or loss of momentum in  our business and financial performance 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies operations has had  and could continue to have  an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may also incur additional and unforeseen expenses in connection with the integration efforts 
there can be no assurance that the expense savings and synergies that we anticipate from the merger will be realized fully or within our expected timeframe 
during and  we also acquired six pcs affiliates and nextel partners 
the process of integrating the business practices  operations and support functions of these companies involves challenges similar to those identified above and could add to those challenges by placing a greater strain on our management and employees 
we are subject to exclusivity provisions and other restrictions under our arrangements with the remaining independent pcs affiliates 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to achieve synergies and fully integrate the operations of nextel and nextel partners in the geographic areas served by those pcs affiliates  and we could incur significant costs to resolve issues related to the merger under these arrangements 
the arrangements with the four independent pcs affiliates restrict our and their ability to own  operate  build or manage specified wireless communication networks or to sell certain wireless services within specified geographic areas 
two of these pcs affiliates have litigation pending against us asserting that actions that we have taken or may take in the future in connection with our integration efforts are inconsistent with our obligations under our agreements with them  particularly with respect to the restrictions noted above 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to achieve synergies and fully integrate the operations of nextel and nextel partners in the areas served by those pcs affiliates 
we could incur significant costs to resolve these issues 
we are subject to restrictions on acquisitions involving our stock and other stock issuances and possibly other corporate opportunities in order to enable the spin off of embarq to qualify for tax free treatment 
the spin off of embarq cannot qualify for tax free treatment if or more by vote or value of our stock  or the stock of embarq  is acquired or issued as part of a plan  or series of related transactions  that includes the spin off 
because the sprint nextel merger generally is treated as involving the acquisition of of our stock and the stock of embarq for purposes of this analysis  we are subject to restrictions on certain acquisitions using our stock and other issuances of our stock in order to enable the spin off to qualify for tax free treatment 
these restrictions apply to transactions occurring subsequent to the spin off that are deemed to be part of a plan or series of transactions related to the sprint nextel merger and the embarq spin off 
under applicable tax law  transactions occurring within two years of the spin off are presumed to be pursuant to such a plan unless we can establish the contrary 
at this time  it is not possible to determine how long these restrictions will apply  or whether they will have a material impact on us 
if the spin off of embarq does not qualify as a tax free transaction  tax could be imposed on both our shareholders and us 
we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  or irs  that the spin off of embarq qualifies for tax free treatment under code sections and in addition  we obtained opinions of counsel from each of cravath  swaine moore llp and paul  weiss  rifkind  wharton garrison llp that the spin off so qualifies 
the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain representations  assumptions and undertakings  including those relating to the past and future conduct of embarq s and our business 
the irs private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualifies for tax free treatment 
the irs could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations  assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated  or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the irs private letter ruling 
if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment  it will be treated as a taxable distribution to our shareholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of embarq s equity securities ie  embarq s common stock issued to our common shareholders received by them 
in addition  we would be required to recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of the embarq equity securities that we distributed on the distribution date plus the fair market value of the senior notes of embarq received by us 
furthermore  subsequent events  some of which are not in our control  could cause us to recognize gain on the distribution 
for example  even minimal acquisitions of our equity securities or embarq s equity securities that are deemed to be part of a plan or a series of related transactions that include the distribution and the sprint nextel merger could cause us to recognize gain on the distribution 
risks related to our business and operations we face intense competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our operating segments face intense competition 
our ability to compete effectively depends on  among other things  the factors discussed below 
if we are not able to attract and retain customers  our financial performance could be impaired 
our ability to compete successfully for new customers and to retain our existing customers will depend on our marketing and sales and service delivery activities  and our credit and collection policies  our ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced products and services that are attractive to existing or potential customers  and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced by our competitors  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions  and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors 
a key element in the economic success of communications carriers is the ability to retain customers as measured by the rate of subscriber churn 
our ability to retain customers and reduce our rate of churn is affected by a number of factors including  with respect to our wireless business  the actual or perceived quality and coverage of our network and the attractiveness of our service offerings 
for example  peak usage in certain metropolitan markets is being impacted by capacity constraints of the iden network  which in turn adversely affects customer satisfaction and churn 
our ability to retain customers also is affected by competitive pricing pressures and the quality of our customer service 
our efforts to reduce churn may not be successful 
a high rate of churn could impair our ability to increase the revenues of  or cause a deterioration in the operating margins of  our wireless operations or our operations as a whole 
as the wireless market matures  we must increasingly seek to attract customers from competitors and face increased credit risk from first time wireless subscribers 
we increasingly must attract a greater proportion of our new customers from our competitors existing customer bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
the higher market penetration also means that customers purchasing wireless services for the first time  on average  have a lower credit rating than existing wireless users  which generally results in a higher rate of involuntary churn and increased bad debt expense 
competition and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our average revenue per user  subscriber churn  our ability to attract new subscribers and operating costs  which would adversely affect our revenues  growth and profitability 
we compete with several other wireless service providers in each of the markets in which we provide wireless services 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we have created pricing plans that have resulted in declining average revenue per minute of use for voice services  a trend which we expect will continue 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact customer retention  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
the wireless communications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
this change causes uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services 
rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies or alternative services that are superior to our technologies or services or that consumers prefer over ours 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose customers to our competitors 
mergers or other business combinations involving our competitors and new entrants  including mvnos  beginning to offer wireless services may also continue to increase competition 
these wireless operators may be able to offer subscribers network features or products and services not offered by us  coverage in areas not served by either of our wireless networks or pricing plans that are lower than those offered by us  all of which would negatively affect our average revenue per user  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs 
for example  at t and verizon now offer competitively priced wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice and high speed internet services  and our boost mobile branded prepaid service competes with a number of regional carriers  including metro pcs and leap wireless  which offer competitively priced calling plans that include unlimited local calling 
one of the primary differentiating features of our nextel branded service is the two way walkie talkie service available on our iden network 
a number of wireless equipment vendors  including motorola  which supplies equipment for our nextel branded service  have begun to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing walkie talkie services that are designed to compete with our walkie talkie services 
several of our competitors have introduced handsets that are capable of providing walkie talkie services 
if these competitors services are perceived to be or become  or if any such services introduced in the future are  comparable to our nextel branded walkie talkie services  a key competitive advantage of our nextel service would be reduced  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
failure to improve wireless subscriber service and failure to continue to enhance the quality and features of our wireless networks and meet capacity requirements of our subscriber growth could impair our financial performance and adversely affect our results of operations 
we must continually make investments and incur costs in order to improve our wireless subscriber service and remain competitive 
in connection with our continuing enhancement of the quality of our wireless networks and related services  we must maintain and expand the capacity and coverage of our networks  secure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites and obtain zoning and construction approvals or permits at appropriate locations  obtain adequate quantities of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  and related accessories to meet subscriber demand  and obtain additional spectrum in some or all of our markets  if and when necessary 
network enhancements may not occur as scheduled or at the cost that we have estimated 
delays or failure to add network capacity  or increased costs of adding capacity  could limit our ability to satisfy our wireless subscribers  resulting in decreased revenues 
even if we continuously upgrade our wireless networks  there can be no assurance that existing subscribers will not prefer features of our competitors and switch wireless providers 
consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our long distance segment competes with at t  verizon  qwest communications  level communications  and cable operators  as well as a host of smaller competitors  in the provision of wireline services 
some of these companies have built high capacity  ip based fiber optic networks capable of supporting large amounts of voice and data traffic 
these companies claim certain cost structure advantages which  among other factors  may allow them to maintain profitability while offering services at a price below that which we can offer profitably 
increased competition and the significant increase in capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may drive already low prices down further 
at t and verizon  as a result of their acquisitions  continue to be our two largest competitors in the domestic long distance communications market 
we and other long distance carriers depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ilecs to serve our long distance customers  and payments to ilecs for these facilities are a significant cost of service for our long distance segment 
the long distance operations of at t and verizon have cost and operational advantages with respect to these access facilities because those carriers serve significant geographic areas  including many large urban areas  as the incumbent local carrier 
failure to complete development  testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
in addition  the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we develop  test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services 
successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend  in part  on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner 
we may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner  and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable  in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology 
deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services 
any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects 
our wireless networks provide services utilizing cdma and iden technologies 
wireless subscribers served by these two technologies represent a smaller portion of global wireless subscribers than the subscribers served by wireless networks that utilize gsm technology 
as a result  our costs with respect to both cdma and iden network equipment and handsets may continue to be higher than the comparable costs incurred by our competitors who use gsm technology  which places us at a competitive disadvantage 
the blurring of the traditional dividing lines between long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
the traditional dividing lines between long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in changes in the regulatory environment that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify across all of our business segments as a result of the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of services offered by existing competitors  and the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products  or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures we will be required to make in order to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in the competitive environment affecting our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue  cash flows and net income 
as a result of the financial strength and benefits of scale enjoyed by some of our competitors  they may be able to offer services at lower prices than we can  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  growth and profitability 
if we are unable to meet our future capital needs relating to investment in our networks and other obligations  it may be necessary for us to curtail  delay or abandon our business growth plans 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans  it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital 
we likely will require additional capital to make the capital expenditures necessary to implement our business plans and support future growth of our wireless business and satisfy our debt service requirements 
in addition  we may incur additional debt in the future for a variety of reasons  including future acquisitions 
we may not be able to arrange additional financing to fund our requirements on terms acceptable to us 
our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on  among other factors  our credit rating  financial performance  general economic conditions and prevailing market conditions 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
failure to obtain suitable financing when needed could  among other things  result in our inability to continue to expand our businesses and meet competitive challenges 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness  or if we do not continue to generate sufficient cash from our operations  our credit rating could be adversely affected  which would likely increase our future borrowing costs and could affect our ability to access capital 
we have entered into outsourcing agreements related to certain business operations 
any difficulties experienced in these arrangements could result in additional expense  loss of customers and revenue  interruption of our services or a delay in the roll out of new technology 
we have entered into outsourcing agreements for the development and maintenance of certain software systems necessary for the operation of our business 
we have also entered into agreements with third parties to provide customer service and related support to our wireless subscribers and outsourced many aspects of our customer care and billing functions to third parties 
we also have entered into an agreement whereby a third party has leased or operates a significant number of our communications towers  and we sublease space on these towers 
as a result  we must rely on third parties to perform certain of our operations and  in certain circumstances  interface with our customers 
if these third parties are unable to perform to our requirements  we would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide these services and that could result in delays  interruptions  additional expenses and loss of customers 
the intellectual property rights utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products from suppliers  including handset device suppliers  and outsource services to service providers  including billing and customer care functions  that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
such claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 
if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets in support of our iden based services  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements for those services  our operations will be adversely affected 
motorola is our sole source for most of the equipment that supports the iden network and for all of the handsets we offer under the nextel brand except primarily for blackberry devices 
although our handset supply agreement with motorola is structured to provide competitively priced handsets  the cost of iden handsets is generally higher than handsets that do not incorporate a similar multi function capability 
this difference may make it more difficult or costly for us to offer handsets at prices that are attractive to potential customers 
in addition  the higher cost of iden handsets requires us to absorb a larger part of the cost of offering handsets to new and existing customers 
these increased costs and handset subsidy expenses may reduce our growth and profitability 
also  we must rely on motorola to develop handsets and equipment capable of supporting the features and services we plan to offer to subscribers of services on our iden network  including a dual mode handset 
a decision by motorola to discontinue manufacturing  supporting or enhancing our iden based infrastructure and handsets would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  because iden technology is not as widely adopted and has fewer subscribers than other wireless technologies and because we expect that over time more of our customers will utilize service offered on our cdma network  it is less likely that manufacturers other than motorola will be willing to make the significant financial commitment required to license  develop and manufacture iden infrastructure equipment and handsets 
further  our ability to timely and efficiently implement the spectrum reconfiguration plan in connection with the fcc s report and order is dependent  in part  on motorola 
the reconfiguration process contemplated by the fcc s report and order may adversely affect our business and operations  which could adversely affect our future growth and operating results 
in order to accomplish the reconfiguration of the mhz spectrum band that is contemplated by the report and order  in most cases we will need to cease our use of a portion of the mhz spectrum on our iden network in a particular market before we are able to commence use of replacement mhz spectrum in that market 
to mitigate the temporary loss of the use of this spectrum  in many markets we will need to construct additional transmitter and receiver sites or acquire additional spectrum in the mhz or mhz bands 
this spectrum may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
in markets where we are unable to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum as needed  the decrease in capacity may adversely affect the performance of our iden network  require us to curtail subscriber additions in those markets until the capacity limitation can be corrected  or a combination of the two 
degradation in network performance in any market could result in higher subscriber churn in that market  the effect of which could be exacerbated if we are forced to curtail subscriber additions in that market 
a resulting loss of a significant number of subscribers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that the reconfiguration process has contributed adversely to the capacity and performance of our iden network  particularly in some of our more capacity constrained markets 
in addition  the report and order gives the fcc the authority to suspend our use of the ghz spectrum that we received under the report and order if we do not comply with our obligations under the report and order 
government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the fcc and other federal  state and local governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the licensing  construction  operation  sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the fcc and  depending on the jurisdiction  state and local regulatory agencies 
in particular  the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees  the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how such services may be offered  and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands 
various states are considering regulations over terms and conditions of service  including such things as certain billing practices and consumer related issues  that may not be preempted by federal law 
if imposed  these regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations 
the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation 
there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed 
failure to comply with fcc requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area 
the fcc has initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage 
it is considering new harmful interference concepts that might permit unlicensed users to share licensed spectrum 
these new uses could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum  and our operational costs 
cmrs providers must implement e capabilities in accordance with fcc rules 
we were unable to satisfy the requirement that of our iden subscriber base have assisted gps capable handsets by december  the matter has been referred to the fcc s enforcement bureau for further action  which could result in fines  new deadlines for compliance or further actions by us to encourage our customers to upgrade their handsets so we can fulfill the requirement 
depending upon their outcome  the fcc s proceedings regarding regulation of special access rates could affect the rates paid by our long distance and wireless segments for special access services in the future 
similarly  depending on their outcome  the fcc s proceedings on the regulatory classification of voip services could affect the intercarrier compensation rates and the level of usf contributions paid by us 
concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks  including cancer  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous wireless carriers  including us  seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase our cost of doing business 
we cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that our business and financial condition will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks 
the actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
further research and studies are ongoing  and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns

item legal proceedings in march  eight purported class action lawsuits relating to the recombination of our tracking stocks were filed against us and our directors by holders of pcs common stock 
seven of the lawsuits were consolidated in the district court of johnson county  kansas 
the eighth  pending in new york  has been voluntarily stayed 
the consolidated lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty in connection with allocations between the wireline operations and the wireless operations before the recombination of the tracking stocks and breach of fiduciary duty in the recombination 
the lawsuit seeks to rescind the recombination and monetary damages 
in december  the court denied defendants motions to dismiss the complaint and for summary judgment  and granted a motion to certify the class 
in february  the court upon reconsideration dismissed a count of the complaint related to intracompany allocations  which requires dismissal of the complaint against three of our former directors and reconsideration of the class definition 
the court has asked the parties for further briefing on the class certification issue and the plaintiffs request for a jury trial 
trial is scheduled for september all defendants have denied plaintiffs allegations and intend to defend this matter vigorously 
in september  the us district court for the district of kansas denied a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging that our and proxy statements were false and misleading in violation of federal securities laws to the extent they described new employment agreements with certain senior executives without disclosing that  according to the allegations  replacement of those executives was inevitable 
these allegations  made in an amended complaint in a lawsuit originally filed in  are asserted against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors  and seek to recover any decline in the value of our tracking stocks during the class period 
the parties have stipulated that the case can proceed as a class action 
all defendants have denied plaintiffs allegations and intend to defend this matter vigorously 
allegations in the original complaint  which asserted claims against the same defendants and our former independent auditor  were dismissed by the court in april a number of putative class action cases that allege sprint communications company lp failed to obtain easements from property owners during the installation of its fiber optic network in the s have been filed in various courts 
several of these cases sought certification of nationwide classes  and in one case  a nationwide class has been certified 
in  a nationwide settlement of these claims was approved by the us district court for the northern district of illinois  but objectors appealed the preliminary approval order to the seventh circuit court of appeals  which overturned the settlement and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings 
the parties now are proceeding with litigation and or settlement negotiations on a state by state basis 
in  we accrued an expense reflecting the estimated settlement costs of these suits 
various other suits  proceedings and claims  including purported class actions  typical for a large business enterprise are pending against us or our subsidiaries 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these proceedings and whether they will be resolved consistent with our beliefs  we expect that the outcome of such proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation

overview we are a global communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses and government customers 
we have organized our operations to meet the needs of our targeted customer groups through focused communications solutions that incorporate the capabilities of our wireless and wireline services to meet their specific needs 
we are one of the three largest wireless companies in the united states based on the number of wireless subscribers 
we own extensive wireless networks and a global long distance  tier internet backbone 
nextel merger and local communications business spin off on august   a subsidiary of our company merged with nextel communications  inc and  as a result  we acquired nextel 
we merged with nextel to secure a number of potential strategic and financial benefits  including those arising from the combination of our networks  spectrum assets  and diverse customer bases and services  the size and scale of the combined company and the opportunity to focus on the fastest growing areas of the communications industry 
we also believe that the merger provides significant opportunities to achieve operating efficiencies by realizing revenue  operating cost and capital spending synergies 
we have begun to realize cost savings and other synergies as a result of the merger and over a number of years expect to continue to realize significant cost savings and other synergies associated with the merger 
however  we believe that our operating results for at least the next several quarters will be impacted negatively by costs that will be incurred to achieve these benefits and other synergies 
such costs are generally not expected to be recurring in nature  and include costs associated with integrating back office systems  severance costs associated with the termination of the employment of certain employees  and lease and other contract termination costs 
the merger and integration costs that we incur will be dependent on a number of business or strategic decisions whose timing cannot be predicted with certainty  which could cause merger and integration costs  and our realization of benefits from the merger and integration efforts  to vary from period to period 
the ability to achieve these cost savings and other synergies and the timing in which the benefits can be realized will depend in large part on the ability to integrate our networks  business operations  back office functions and other support systems and infrastructure 
at the time that we announced the merger  we also announced our plans to spin off to our shareholders our local communications business  which is now known as embarq corporation and is comprised primarily of what was our local segment prior to the spin off 
we completed the spin off on may  in the spin off  we distributed pro rata to our shareholders one embarq common share for every shares of our voting and non voting common stock  or about million shares of embarq common stock  and received net cash consideration and net proceeds from the sale of embarq senior notes totaling about billion 
cash was paid for fractional shares 
as a result of the spin off  we no longer own any shares of embarq 
the results of embarq for periods prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations 
we received a ruling from the internal revenue service that  based on certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings set forth in the ruling  for us federal income tax purposes  the distribution of embarq common shares is not taxable to us or us holders of our common shares  except cash payments made in lieu of fractional shares  which generally are taxable 
business we offer a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses and government customers 
we conduct our operations through two segments referred to as wireless and long distance 
we  together with the pcs affiliates  offer digital wireless services in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands under the sprint brand name utilizing wireless code division multiple access  or cdma  technology 
the pcs affiliates  through commercial arrangements with us  provide wireless services mainly in and around smaller us metropolitan areas on wireless networks built and operated at their expense  in most instances using spectrum licensed to and controlled by us 
during  we acquired three pcs affiliates and in we acquired three additional pcs affiliates 
we also offer digital wireless services under the nextel and boost brand names using iden technology 
during  we acquired nextel partners which provides digital wireless communications services under the nextel brand name in certain mid sized and tertiary us markets 
the acquisitions of these pcs affiliates and nextel partners gave us more control of the distribution of services under our sprint and nextel brands  and provide us with the strategic and financial benefits associated with a larger customer base and expanded network coverage 
we also are one of the largest providers of long distance services and one of the largest carriers of internet traffic in the nation 
we believe the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price  the types of services offered and quality of service 
although we believe that many of our targeted customers base their purchase decisions on quality of service and the availability of differentiated features and services  competitive pricing  both in terms of the monthly recurring charges and the number of minutes or other features available under a particular rate plan  and handset offerings are often important factors in potential customers purchase decisions 
our industry has been and continues to be subject to consolidation and dynamic change as well as intense competition 
to maintain our operating margins in a price competitive environment  we continually seek ways to create or improve capital and operating efficiencies in our business 
consequently  we routinely reassess our business strategies and their implications on our operations  and these assessments may continue to impact the future valuation of our long lived assets 
as part of our overall business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand and complement our business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that  if consummated  could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the fcc regulates the licensing  operation  acquisition and sale of the licensed radio spectrum that is essential to our business 
the fcc and state public utilities commissions  or pucs  also regulate the provision of communications services 
future changes in regulations or legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations 
management overview wireless we offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services on networks that utilize cdma and iden technologies to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses and government customers 
through our wireless segment  we  together with the four remaining pcs affiliates  offer digital wireless service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and provide wireless coverage in over metropolitan markets  including of the largest us metropolitan areas  where more than million people live or work 
we offer wireless international voice roaming for subscribers of both cdma and iden based services in numerous countries 
we  together with the pcs affiliates and resellers of our wholesale wireless services  served about million wireless subscribers at the end of we offer wireless mobile telephone and data transmission services and features in a variety of pricing plans  including prepaid service plans 
we offer these services  other than those offered under prepaid service plans  typically on a contract basis  for one or two year periods  with services billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan 
we market our prepaid services under the boost mobile brand  as a means to directly target the youth and prepaid wireless service markets 
we also offer wholesale wireless services to resellers  commonly known as mobile virtual network operators  or mvnos  such as embarq  modiva communications  inc  helio inc  qwest communications international  inc  the walt disney company and virgin mobile usa  which purchase wireless services from us at wholesale rates and resell the services to their customers under their own brand names 
under these mvno arrangements  the operators bear the costs of acquisition  billing and customer service 
we also provide wireless services that are marketed and sold by several cable multiple systems operators  or msos  in four markets 
we also have entered into an agreement with several cable msos to jointly develop converged services designed to combine many of cable s core products and interactive features with wireless technology to deliver a broad range of services  including video  wireless voice and data services  high speed internet and cable phone service  to the participating cable mso s customers 
during  we expect to develop new products and services and introduce service in additional markets 
our strategy is to utilize state of the art technology to provide differentiated wireless services and applications in order to acquire and retain high quality wireless subscribers 
we offer numerous sophisticated data messaging  imaging  entertainment and location based applications  marketed as power vision sm  across our cdma network that utilize high speed evolution data optimized  or ev do  technology 
currently ev do technology covers nearly million people and serves customers in over communities with populations of at least  ev do data roaming is available in selected markets in canada and mexico 
we also have begun to incorporate ev do rev 
a  the next version of ev do technology  into our network  with plans for coverage across the majority of the footprint of our cdma network by the end of ev do rev 
a is designed to support a variety of internet protocol  or ip  and video and high performance walkie talkie applications for our cdma network 
on our iden network  we continue to support features and services that are designed to meet the needs of our customers 
both the nextel and boost mobile brands feature our industry leading walkie talkie services  which give subscribers the ability to communicate instantly across the continental united states and to and from hawaii and  through agreements with other iden providers  to and from selected markets in canada  latin america and mexico  as well as a variety of digital wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services 
in recent periods  we have experienced declines in the number of new subscribers for our wireless services and increases in our rate of subscriber churn 
customer satisfaction and churn have been adversely impacted by capacity constraints on our iden network as a result of a number of factors  including the addition to the network in recent years of many high call volume subscribers  limited effectiveness of the voice coder upgrade in the iden technology that was designed to increase network capacity  and the impact of the reconfiguration process under the report and order 
in certain of our most capacity constrained markets  we have had to take actions to limit the acquisition of new subscribers of nextel and boost mobile branded services 
also  churn of subscribers of our cdma services remains high relative to our competitors  in large part due to credit related deactivations 
in  we reorganized our sales and distribution and customer management operations to improve customer satisfaction  adopted a regional sales  service  and distribution structure to streamline operations  increase productivity and move decision making closer to the customer  and tightened our credit policies for new subscribers of both cdma and iden services 
in  we are adding cell sites to improve network performance and expand the coverage and capacity of our networks  are increasing media expenditures to improve brand awareness  have enhanced incentives to improve third party sales distribution and accelerate growth  and are implementing customer retention programs that focus on our high value customers  are adjusting our credit policies on a market by market basis in an effort to optimize the balance between new subscribers who are of a prime and sub prime quality  are improving our handset portfolio across both our cdma and iden network platforms  are helping to relieve capacity constraints on the iden network and to offer subscribers of our iden services all of the benefits of applications on our cdma network and our walkie talkie applications  by offering a new line of combined cdma iden devices  marketed as powersource tm  that feature voice and data applications over our cdma network and walkie talkie applications over our iden network and we are expecting to introduce powersource devices that also feature our power vision data applications over our cdma network  and expect to substantially complete the integration of a number of other systems  including human resources  general ledger  sales commissions and billing 
we believe that integration of these systems onto single platforms will create efficiencies in the way we do business  and in the case of our billing system  will increase functionality for our customer care representatives and produce more reliable information  which should enhance the customer experience 
we have completed various phases of our systems and processes consolidation plan in the fourth quarter as discussed in part ii  item a  controls and procedures 
in the future  we also plan to utilize qualcomm incorporated s qchat technology  which is designed to provide high performance walkie talkie services on our cdma network  and we are designing interfaces to provide for interoperability of walkie talkie services on our cdma and iden networks 
we also plan to deploy a next generation broadband wireless network that will be designed to provide significantly higher data transport speeds using our spectrum holdings in the gigahertz  or ghz  band and technology based on the worldwide inter operability for microwave access  or wimax  standard 
we are designing this network to support a wide range of high speed ip based wireless services 
our initial plans contemplate deploying the new network in larger metropolitan areas with a goal of launching the related service offerings in some of those markets beginning in our wireless segment generates revenues from the provision of wireless services  the sale of wireless equipment and the provision of wholesale and other services 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of the number of subscribers that we serve  which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers  and the revenue generated by each subscriber  which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates that we charge for those services 
we believe that wireless carriers increasingly must attract a greater proportion of new customers from the existing customer bases of competitors rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
for example  we are experiencing increased competition in our prepaid and youth markets from new entrants that are targeting these subscribers 
certain of our competitors continue to increase their focus on customer retention efforts and have reported improvements in their customer retention rates  which may make it harder for us to acquire new customers from these competitors 
in addition  the higher market penetration of wireless services in our markets may suggest that customers purchasing wireless services for the first time may  on average  have a lower credit rating than existing wireless users  which generally results in both a higher churn rate due to involuntary churn and in higher bad debt expense 
this has intensified the competition among wireless carriers to attract higher quality customers with stronger credit standing  resulting in aggressive pricing strategies for both voice services and other features that are designed to attract those customers 
we have also experienced declines in the average voice revenue per subscriber due to our offering more competitive service pricing plans  including lower priced plans  such as business essentials and plans that allow users to add additional units to their plans at attractive rates 
we are developing and implementing service plans that are designed to offset these declines in voice revenue by expanding and enhancing our value added array of imaging  high speed data messaging  entertainment and location based applications 
recently  the growth in revenue per subscriber generated by these data services  while significant  has not kept pace with the decline in voice revenue  resulting in a decline in our overall monthly average revenue per subscriber 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate equipment revenues is primarily a function of the number of new and existing subscribers who purchase handsets and other accessories 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate wholesale revenues is primarily a function of the number and type of mvnos that resell our wireless service and the rates that we charge mvnos for utilization of our network 
although many of the costs relating to the operation of our wireless networks are fixed in the short term  other costs  such as interconnection fees  fluctuate based on the utilization of the networks 
sales and marketing expenses are dependent on the number of subscriber additions and the nature and extent of our marketing and promotional activities 
customer care costs are dependent on the number of subscribers that we serve and the nature of programs designed to serve and retain subscribers 
general and administrative expenses consist of fees paid for billing  customer care and information technology operations  bad debt expense  customer retention and back office support activities  including collections  legal  finance  human resources  strategic planning and technology and product development  along with the related payroll and facilities costs 
although our goal is to improve operating margins through cost savings initiatives and benefits of scale  costs that fluctuate based on network utilization and the number of subscribers that we serve and costs associated with enhancing and expanding the coverage of our network generally will increase in absolute terms over time 
we also seek to realize operating efficiencies in our business from merger related cost savings and other synergies 
in february  nextel accepted the terms and conditions of the report and order  which implemented a spectrum reconfiguration plan designed to eliminate interference with public safety operators in the mhz band 
under the terms of the report and order  nextel surrendered certain spectrum rights and received certain other spectrum rights  and undertook to pay the costs incurred by nextel and third parties in connection with the reconfiguration plan  which is required to be completed within a month period  subject to certain exceptions particularly with respect to markets that border mexico and canada 
we assumed these obligations when we merged with nextel in august if  as a result of events within our control  we fail to complete the reconfiguration plan within the month period  the fcc could take actions against us to enforce the report and order 
these actions could have adverse operating or financial impacts on us  some of which could be material 
we believe that  based on our experiences to date  we will not complete the reconfiguration process within the month period due to events largely outside of our control 
we do not believe at this time that the impact from this delay will be material to our results of operation or financial condition  although there can be no assurance 
recognizing the current limitations in the reconfiguration process  both sprint nextel and the public safety community jointly filed a letter with the fcc on february  requesting that the fcc direct the transition administrator  through working closely with the affected parties  to develop a schedule and benchmarks for completing the second phase of the mhz reconfiguration 
see forward looking statements 
as part of the reconfiguration process in most markets  we must cease using portions of the surrendered mhz spectrum before we are able to commence use of replacement mhz spectrum  which has contributed to the capacity constraints experienced on our iden network  particularly in some of our more capacity constrained markets  and has impacted performance of our iden network in the affected markets 
based on the fcc s determination of the values of the spectrum rights received and surrendered by nextel  the minimum obligation to be incurred under the report and order is billion 
the report and order also provides that qualifying costs we incur as part of the reconfiguration plan  including costs to reconfigure our own infrastructure and spectrum positions  can be used to offset the minimum obligation of billion  however  we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed that amount 
in addition  a financial reconciliation is required to be completed at the end of the reconfiguration implementation  at which time we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury to the extent that the value of the spectrum rights received exceeds the total of i the value of spectrum rights that are surrendered and ii the qualifying costs referred to above 
as a result of the uncertainty with regard to the calculation of the credit for our internal network costs  as well as the significant number of variables outside of our control  particularly with regard to the mhz reconfiguration licensee costs  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate what amount  if any  will be paid to the us treasury 
as required under the terms of the report and order  we delivered a billion letter of credit to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
although the report and order provides for the possibility of periodic reductions in the amount of the letter of credit  no reductions have been made as of december  long distance through our long distance segment  we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services targeted to domestic business customers  multinational corporations and other communications companies 
these services include domestic and international data communications using various protocols  such as multi protocol label switching  or mpls  technologies  internet protocol  or ip  asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  frame relay  managed network services and voice services 
we also provide services to the cable msos that resell our long distance service and or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user customers 
we are one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital long distance and tier ip networks 
for several years  our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies  as well as cable msos and internet service providers 
growth in voice services provided by cable msos is accelerating as consumers use cable msos as alternatives to local and long distance voice communications providers 
we continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our long distance segment and are focusing our efforts on ip based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non ip based data services 
for example  in addition to increased emphasis on selling ip services  we are converting many of our existing customers from atm and frame relay to more advanced ip technologies  in part to support our effort to move to one platform  which will reduce our cost structure 
over time  this conversion is expected to result in decreases in revenue from frame relay and atm service offset by increases in ip and mpls services 
we also are taking advantage of the growth in voice services provided by cable msos  by providing large cable msos with long distance voice communications service  which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations  either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates 
while management believes that the estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues  revenues generated from handset and accessory sales and revenues from wholesale operators and pcs affiliates  as well as long distance voice  data and internet revenues 
service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges  variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees  such as activation fees  directory assistance  operator assisted calling  equipment protection  late payment charges and certain regulatory related fees 
we recognize service revenues as services are rendered and equipment revenue when title passes to the dealer or end user customer  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts  billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage 
we recognize excess wireless usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
additionally  we recognize excess wireless data usage based on kilobytes and one time use charges  such as for the use of premium services  as incurred 
as a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month  we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and our historical usage and billing patterns and represented about of our accounts receivable balance as of december  certain of our bundled products and services  primarily in our wireless segment  are considered to be revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
total consideration received in these arrangements is allocated and measured using units of accounting within the arrangement ie  service and handset contracts based on relative fair values 
the activation fee revenue associated with these arrangements in our direct sales channels is recognized as equipment sales at the time the related handset is sold 
for our indirect sales channels  the activation fee is solely linked to the service contract with the subscriber 
accordingly  the activation fee revenue is deferred and amortized over the estimated average service life of the end user customer  and is classified as service revenue 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
because of the number of accounts that we have  it is not practical to review the collectibility of each of those accounts individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts each period  although we do perform some account level analysis with respect to long distance customers 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors  including collection experience  current economic trends  estimates of forecasted write offs  aging of the accounts receivable portfolios  industry norms  regulatory decisions and other factors 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate at december  were to change by  it would represent a change in bad debt expense of million for the wireless segment and million for the long distance segment 
the accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue in the results of operations require us to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers  unauthorized usage and future returns on handset sales 
the allowance amounts recorded  in each instance  represent our best estimate of future outcomes  but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimate selected  and the impact that changes in our actual performance versus these amounts recorded would have on the accounts receivable reported on our balance sheet and our results of operations could be material to our financial condition 
inventories inventories of handsets and accessories in the wireless segment and inventories in the long distance segment are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost by the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
handset costs in excess of the revenues generated from handset sales  or handset subsidies  are expensed at the time of sale 
we do not recognize the expected handset subsidies prior to the time of sale because the promotional discount decision is made at the point of sale and or because we expect to recover the handset subsidies through service revenues 
as of december   we held about billion of inventory 
we analyze the realizable value of our handset and other inventory on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes assessing obsolescence  sales forecasts  product life cycle  marketplace and other considerations 
if our assessments regarding the above factors change  we may be required to sell handsets at a higher subsidy or potentially record expense in future periods prior to the point of sale to the extent that we expect that we will be unable to sell handsets with a service contract 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets including definite lived intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
long lived assets consisting of property  plant and equipment represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives as follows long lived assets estimated useful life average useful life buildings and improvements to years years network equipment and software to years years non network internal use software  office equipment and other to years years since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change  we perform annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for most categories of property  plant and equipment 
these studies utilize models  which take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions about technology evolution  to calculate the remaining life of our asset base 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the original assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted estimated useful life 
if our studies had resulted in a depreciable rate that was higher or lower than those used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by about million 
in addition to performing our annual studies  we also continue to assess the estimated useful life of the iden network assets  which had a net carrying value of billion as of december   and our future strategic plans for this network  as a larger portion of our subscriber base is served by our cdma network 
a reduction in our estimate of the useful life of the iden network assets would cause increased depreciation charges in future periods that could be material 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  our views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
for software projects that are under development  we periodically assess the probability of deployment into the business to determine if an impairment charge is required 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in asset impairment charges primarily related to software asset impairments and abandonments of various assets  including certain cell sites under construction 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in asset impairment charges primarily related to the write down of various software applications 
in  we determined that business conditions and events impacting our long distance operations constituted an indicator of possible impairment requiring an evaluation of the recoverability of the long distance long lived assets  which resulted in a non cash asset impairment charge of billion  reducing the net carrying value of long distance property  plant and equipment by about to billion at september  additionally  we recognized a non cash charge of million in to adjust the carrying value of our wholesale dial ip assets to fair value 
these impairments represented of long distance s property  plant and equipment  net and of the consolidated property  plant and equipment  net at december  intangible assets with definite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships that are amortized over three to five years using the sum of the years digits method  which we believe best reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed 
other definite lived intangible assets primarily include certain rights under affiliation agreements that we reacquired in connection with the acquisitions of the pcs affiliates and nextel partners  which are being amortized over the remaining terms of those affiliation agreements on a straight line basis  and the nextel and direct connectsm trade names  which are being amortized over years from the date of the sprint nextel merger on a straight line basis 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist that would trigger a test of any of these definite lived intangible assets  including  but not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  cash flows or a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used 
in addition  if we ever were required to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill as part of a second step goodwill impairment test  it would result in our evaluating the recorded value of our definite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives of our definite lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization  which would be addressed prospectively 
for example  we review certain trends such as customer churn  average revenue per user  revenue  our future plans regarding the iden network and changes in marketing strategies  among others 
significant changes in certain trends may cause us to adjust  on a prospective basis  the remaining estimated life of certain of our definite lived intangible assets 
valuation and recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we have identified fcc licenses and our sprint and boost mobile trademarks as indefinite lived intangible assets  in addition to our goodwill  after considering the expected use of the assets  the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used  and the effects of obsolescence on their use 
we review our goodwill  which relates solely to our wireless reporting unit  and other indefinite lived intangibles annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  a sustained  significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  changes in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or slower growth rates  among others 
when required  we first test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our wireless reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired  and no further testing would be necessary 
if the carrying amount of our wireless reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  we would perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
to measure the amount of any impairment loss  we would determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our wireless reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
when required  we test other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the asset s respective carrying value to estimates of fair value  determined using the direct value method 
our fcc licenses are combined as a single unit of accounting following the unit of accounting guidance as prescribed by eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  except for our fcc licenses in the ghz band  which are tested separately 
the accounting estimates related to our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets require us to make significant assumptions about fair values 
our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations  as well as our views regarding the prospects of our business 
changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values 
during the fourth quarter  we performed our annual goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset analyses as described above 
the result of these analyses was that our indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired 
as permitted by financial accounting standards board  or fasb  guidance  our goodwill analysis included an estimate of a control premium with respect to the minority interest traded value of our common shares and an estimate of the value of our long distance business  as well as other assumptions 
as of december   we have not identified any indicators of impairment with respect to our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
however  if our share price were to experience a sustained  significant decline as compared to the share price as of december   or if any other indicator of impairment exists  such as a decline in expected cash flows  we may be required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test  which could cause us to recognize a non cash impairment charge that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
tax valuation allowances we are required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
we record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
additionally  we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions based upon our judgment regarding potential future challenges to those positions 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position 
the accounting estimate related to the tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material 
we carried an income tax valuation allowance of million as of december  this amount includes a valuation allowance of million for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards  subject to utilization restrictions  acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates to capital loss  state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
within our total valuation allowance we had million related to separate company state net operating losses incurred by the pcs entities while owned by us 
the valuation allowance was provided on these separate company state net operating loss benefits since these entities had no history of taxable income 
current trends indicate that the valuation allowance continues to be appropriate and we do not anticipate adjusting this amount in the near term 
we continue to monitor these trends  and in the future it is possible that our cumulative historical test will ultimately yield sufficient positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefit of some of the separate company state net operating losses for which the valuation allowance has been provided 
should that occur  subject to review of other qualitative factors and uncertainties at that time  we would expect to start reversing some of the valuation allowance 
for the valuation allowance related to the acquired tax benefits described above  we would first reduce goodwill or intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions  or reduce income tax expense if these intangible assets have been reduced to zero 
for the remainder of our valuation allowance  we would reduce income tax expense 
assumption changes that result in a change of expected benefits from realization of capital loss  state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards by would result in a decrease or increase in our valuation allowance by million  which would be reflected in the statement of operations

fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for our quarterly reporting period ending march  the cumulative effect of adopting fin generally will be recorded directly to retained earnings 
however  to the extent the adoption of fin results in a revaluation of uncertain tax positions acquired in purchase business combinations  the cumulative effect will be recorded as an adjustment to any goodwill remaining from the corresponding business combination 
we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations we present consolidated information as well as separate supplemental financial information for our two reportable segments  wireless and long distance

this adjustment did not impact direct net subscriber additions or the monthly customer churn rates for the quarter ended december  in addition  there were additional customer subscriber base adjustments of  during the first three quarters of direct net subscriber additions do not include subscribers acquired in connection with the sprint nextel merger or the pcs affiliate or nextel partners acquisitions 
the direct prepaid monthly customer churn rate and average monthly service revenue per user metrics in are calculated based only on results subsequent to the sprint nextel merger 
service revenue service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges  variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees  directory assistance  operator assisted calling  equipment protection  late payment charges and certain regulatory related fees 
service revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to the sprint nextel merger and other acquisitions and the increase in the number of our direct subscribers  partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average monthly service revenue per user to in as compared to in service revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to the merger with nextel and the increase in the number of our direct subscribers  while our weighted average monthly service revenue per user remained flat year over year 
in  we ended the year with about million direct subscribers and during the year had about million net direct subscriber additions  excluding the nextel partners and pcs affiliate subscribers of about million that were acquired with these companies 
in comparison  we ended with about million direct subscribers and during the year had about million net direct subscriber additions excluding the nextel and pcs affiliate subscribers of about million that were acquired with the merger or acquisition of these companies 
in  we ended the year with about million direct subscribers and had about million net direct subscriber additions 
we believe that the growth in direct subscribers  separate from the growth attributable to subscribers gained as part of the sprint nextel merger and pcs affiliate and nextel partners acquisitions  is primarily due to the following factors growth in the number of subscribers purchasing our wireless prepaid service offering of in compared to in for a end of period wireless prepaid subscriber total of million  our differentiating products and services  particularly data related services  including those available under our sprint power vision service plans  and other non voice services  such as instant messaging and emails  sending and receiving pictures  playing on line games and browsing the internet wirelessly  and selected handset pricing promotions and improved handset choices 
our weighted average monthly service revenue per user decreased to in from in both and  primarily due to the following factors we continued to offer more competitive service pricing plans  including lower priced plans  such as business essentials on both the iden and cdma networks and plans that allow users to add additional units to their plan at attractive rates  such as add a phone and family plans  our prepaid wireless subscribers  who generally have a lower average revenue per user  as illustrated in the table above  increased as a percentage of our total subscriber base to in compared to in  and our integrated pcs affiliate subscribers  who have a lower average monthly service revenue and who will no longer be a source of roaming revenue for us  partially offset by the increase in data service revenues  resulting from higher usage as subscribers took advantage of our wide array of data offerings such as short message service  or sms  connection cards and our sprint vision and power vision service plans 
we have limited distribution of our prepaid services  which may adversely impact our ability to add users of prepaid services in the affected markets 
we also are adjusting our credit policies in certain markets  which may adversely impact our ability to add lower credit quality subscribers in markets with relatively tight credit policies 
we expect our weighted average monthly service revenue per user to continue to decline as a result of decreases in pricing due to competitive market pricing  incremental customer acquisitions at lower average revenues and existing customer migrations to lower priced plans  partially offset by expected growth in demand for our data services

cost of services increased in compared to and in compared to  primarily due to increased costs relating to the expansion of our network and increased minutes of use on our networks due to our acquisitions 
specifically  we experienced an increase in cell site and switch related operational costs  including increases in fixed and variable interconnection costs  due to the increase in usage  cell sites and related equipment in service  an increase in backhaul costs driven by the increased capacity required to support our ev do service  as well as our pcs affiliate and nextel partners acquisitions  and an increase in costs for premium data services resulting from increased subscriber data usage  partially offset by the decrease in roaming expenses due to the acquisition of nextel partners and the pcs affiliates

our subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to customers such as offering new handsets at discounted prices 
we expect to increase handset subsidies to acquire new subscribers or to retain existing subscribers 
for example  we have introduced a new line of hybrid cdma iden devices  marketed as powersource  and may offer these devices at a discount in an effort to retain our iden subscribers  which may result in an increase in handset subsidies in future periods

this responsibility includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding the timing and amount of capital expenditures 
discontinued operations on may   we completed the spin off of embarq 
the separation of embarq from us resulted in two separate companies each of which can focus on maximizing opportunities for its distinct business 
we believe this separation presents the opportunity for enhanced performance of each of the two companies  including allowing each company separately to pursue the business and regulatory strategies that best suit its long term interests and  by doing so  addressing the growing strategic divergence between embarq s local wireline centric focus and our increasingly national wireless centric focus  creating separate companies that have different financial characteristics  which may appeal to different investor bases  creating opportunities to more efficiently develop and finance expansion plans  and creating effective management incentives tied to the relevant company s performance 
in the spin off  we distributed pro rata to our shareholders one embarq common share for every shares of our voting and non voting common stock  or about million embarq common shares 
cash was paid for fractional shares 
the distribution of embarq common shares is considered a tax free transaction for us and for our shareholders  except cash payments made in lieu of fractional shares which are generally taxable

the cash and senior notes were transferred by our parent company to our finance subsidiary  sprint capital corporation  in satisfaction of indebtedness owed by our parent company to sprint capital 
on may   sprint capital sold the embarq senior notes to the public  and received about billion in net proceeds 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with embarq  which provide that generally each party will be responsible for its respective assets  liabilities and businesses following the spin off and that we and embarq will provide each other with certain transition services relating to our respective businesses for specified periods at cost based prices 
we also entered into agreements pursuant to which we and embarq will provide each other with specified services at commercial rates 
further  the agreements provide for a settlement process surrounding the transfer of certain assets and liabilities 
it is possible that adjustments will occur in future periods as these matters are settled 
at the time of the spin off  all outstanding options to purchase our common stock held by employees of embarq were cancelled and replaced with options to purchase embarq common stock 
outstanding options to purchase our common stock held by our directors and employees who remained with us were adjusted by multiplying the number of shares subject to the options by and dividing the exercise price by the same number in order to account for the impact of the spin off on the value of our shares at the time the spin off was completed 
generally  restricted stock units awarded pursuant to our equity incentive plans and held by our employees at the time of the spin off including those held by those of our employees who became employees of embarq were treated in a manner similar to the treatment of outstanding shares of our common stock in the spin off 
holders of these restricted stock units received one embarq restricted stock unit for every twenty restricted stock units held 
outstanding deferred shares granted under the nextel incentive equity plan  which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock  were adjusted by multiplying the number of deferred shares by 
cash was paid to the holders of deferred shares in lieu of fractional shares

liquidity as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion 
we have a billion revolving credit facility  which represents our total committed financing capacity under this facility 
this credit facility  which expires in december  provides for interest rates equal to the london interbank offered rate  or libor  or prime rate plus a spread that varies depending on the parent company s credit ratings 
there is no rating trigger that would allow the lenders involved to terminate this facility in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
in april  we commenced a commercial paper program  which reduced our borrowing costs by allowing us to issue short term debt at lower rates than those available under our billion revolving credit facility 
the billion program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces the amount we can borrow under the facility to the extent of the commercial paper outstanding 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding  net of discounts 
although our credit rating remains investment grade  recent downgrades to our credit rating by major credit rating agencies have impacted  and may continue to impact  our ability to place the paper with investors  as well as the duration and interest rates of commercial paper issued since the ratings downgrade 
as of december   we had billion in letters of credit  including a billion letter of credit required by the report and order  outstanding under our billion revolving credit facility 
these letters of credit reduce the availability under the revolving credit facility by an equivalent amount 
as a result of the letters of credit and outstanding commercial paper  we had about billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we had million of general letters of credit outstanding 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants  including all financial ratio tests  associated with our borrowings 
our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately impacted by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets 
given the volatility in these markets  we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable capital cost structure 
as of december   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of billion as of december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the utilization of cash to fund our acquisitions  the impact of the spin off of embarq  debt payments and retirements  the purchase of common shares and the retirement of our seventh series redeemable preferred shares

future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under gaap currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts

interest payments are based on management s expectations for future interest rates

includes future lease costs related to sites  switches  offices  retail stores  circuits  towers and spectrum 
excludes billion of blanket purchase orders 
see below for further discussion 
the table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligation under the report and order 
the total minimum cash obligation for the report and order is billion 
costs incurred under the report and order associated with the reconfiguration of the mhz band may be applied against the billion obligation  subject to approval by the transition administrator under the report and order 
in addition  costs associated with the reconfiguration of the ghz spectrum are not fully approved for credit until the completion of the entire reconfiguration process 
because the final reconciliation and audit of the entire reconfiguration obligation outlined in the report and order will not take place until after the completion of all aspects of the reconfiguration process  there can be no assurance that we will be given full credit for the expenditures that we have incurred under the report and order 
additionally  since we  the transition administrator and the fcc have not yet reached an agreement on the methodology for calculating certain amounts of property  plant and equipment to be submitted for credit associated with reconfiguration activity with our own network  we cannot provide assurance that we will be granted full credit for certain of these network costs 
as a result of the uncertainty with regard to the calculation of the credit for our internal network costs  as well as the significant number of variables outside of our control  particularly with regard to the mhz reconfiguration licensee costs  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate what amount  if any  will be paid to the us treasury 
since the inception of the program through december   we estimate that we have incurred million of costs directly attributable to the reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any indirect network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program 
purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
they include agreements for communications and customer billing services  advertising services and contracts related to information technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements 
amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted  subscribers and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes about billion of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified 
no time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding 
as a result  they are not firm commitments

future outlook we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs for at least the next months by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  and or cash available under our existing credit facility and our commercial paper program 
in making this assessment  we have considered anticipated levels of capital expenditures  including funding required in connection with the deployment of next generation technologies and our next generation broadband wireless network  anticipated payments under the report and order  declared and anticipated dividend payments  scheduled debt service requirements and purchases of our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program  merger and integration costs associated with the sprint nextel merger and the acquisitions of the pcs affiliates and nextel partners  and other future contractual obligations 
if there are material changes in our business plans  or currently prevailing or anticipated economic conditions in any of our markets or competitive practices in the mobile wireless communications industry  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow or profitability  anticipated cash needs could change significantly 
the conclusion that we expect to meet our funding needs for at least the next months as described above does not take into account any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies  potential material purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt securities for cash  and potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources  including existing cash on hand  borrowings available under our existing credit facility and our commercial paper program 
if existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs  it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that cannot currently be predicted with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  the market prices of our securities  and tax law restrictions related to the spin off of embarq that may limit our ability to raise capital from the sale of our equity securities 
we have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  other than the existing arrangements that have been described in this report  we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital 
the above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under forward looking statements and in part i  item a risk factors 
financial strategies general risk management policies we primarily use derivative instruments for hedging and risk management purposes 
hedging activities may be done for various purposes  including  but not limited to  mitigating the risks associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes  credit support agreements  continual review and monitoring of all counterparties  and thorough legal review of contracts 
we also control exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits 
our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions  and all transactions comply with the policy 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments  usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currencies and equity prices 
the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
specific interest rate risk include the risk of increasing interest rates on short term debt  the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings  and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned refinancing using long term fixed rate debt 
cash flow hedges we enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk 
the interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that were designated as fair value hedges 
about of our debt as of december  was fixed rate debt excluding interest rate swaps 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
as of december   we held fair value interest rate swaps with a notional value of billion 
these swaps were entered into as hedges of the fair value of a portion of our senior notes 
these interest rate swaps have maturities ranging from to on a semiannual basis  we pay a floating rate of interest equal to the six month libor plus a fixed spread and receive an average interest rate equal to the coupon rates stated on the underlying senior notes 
on december   the rate we would pay averaged and the rate we would receive was 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing forward yield curve  the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying senior notes would change by million 
these interest rate swaps met all the requirements for perfect effectiveness under derivative accounting rules as all of the critical terms of the swaps perfectly matched the corresponding terms of the hedged debt  therefore  there is no net effect to earnings and cash flows for any fair value fluctuations 
we perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt including interest rate swaps 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on our statements of operations and cash flows as of december  while our variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair values 
we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in the fair market value of our debt to billion 
this analysis includes the hedged debt 
in  we entered into a series of interest rate collars associated with the issuance of debt by embarq at the time of its spin off on may  these collars were designated as cash flow hedges in embarq s consolidated financial statements against the variability in interest payments that would result from a change in interest rates before the debt was issued at the time of the spin off 
however  because the forecasted interest payments of debt started after the spin off  the derivative instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in our consolidated financial statements 
as such  included in discontinued operations in is million in gains  after tax  realized from the change in fair value of these interest rate collars 
foreign currency risk we also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and net foreign currency receivables from international operations was million as of december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant 
equity risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate 
these securities  which are classified in investments and marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets  include equity method investments  investments in private securities  available for sale securities and equity derivative instruments 
we entered into a series of option contracts associated with our investment in nii holdings in order to hedge the price risk associated with this security 
the first of these contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and the changes in fair value of that contract were recognized in earnings during the period of change 
the remainder of these equity derivative instruments were settled in december additional information regarding our derivative instruments can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
in certain business transactions  we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates 
these warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments 
during and  we entered into variable prepaid forward contracts to monetize equity securities held as available for sale 
the derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in expected cash flows related to the forecasted sale of the underlying equity securities 
these prepaid contracts were settled between the fourth quarter and fourth quarter
