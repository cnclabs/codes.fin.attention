liquidity and capital resources despite having a net loss of  for fiscal  our operations produced net cash of  during fiscal  we wrote off  of inventories   of capitalized test software  and  of property and equipment no longer in use  all of which increased the net loss but did not affect cash flows from operations 
during the year  we also increased our inventory valuation allowance by  while writing off  of inventories against this valuation allowance 
we also continue to purchase additional available for sale securities as a means to increase the return on our cash and cash equivalents balances  with purchases of  in fiscal capital expenditures of  included leasehold improvements for our new facilities into which we moved on september  while producing a net income of  during fiscal  our operations produced net cash of  during the year  we increased the inventory valuation allowance by  and wrote off  of capitalized test software  both of which reduced net income but not cash flows 
in addition  logic collected  from a property tax refund and had increases in its accrued payroll and vacation and other accrued expenses totaling  due to the timing of these expenses 
capital expenditures of  for fiscal were substantially less than fiscal  which totaled  despite a net loss of  for fiscal  our operations produced net cash of  which is mainly the result of a reduction of inventories of  the collection of a sales tax refund of  and an increase in accounts payable of  at year end 
the increase in accounts payable was from the timing of purchases and invoices being received but not yet due at year end 
we maintain prompt payment terms with our vendors 
the percent decrease in our net cash balance from  in fiscal to  at september  was the result of a substantial increase in capital expenditures totaling  including a one time purchase of  of engineering design software and capitalized software development costs of  our current working capital requirements are greatly reduced due to our past cost cutting 
we believe that these cost cutting actions and our continued focus on higher margin products should result in after tax cash earnings being sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
based on the fact that  as of december   we hold approximately million in cash reserves and available for sale securities and our cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than our current revenue rate  we believe we can cover our cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
working capital our investment in inventories has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
however  during the past few years  we have been able to reduce our levels of inventories as we shift from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products 
we seek to further streamline our inventories as we continue to shift to sole source proprietary products 
we rely on third party suppliers for our raw materials  particularly our processed wafers  for which we currently rely primarily on two suppliers  and as a result  maintain substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
we have periodically experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers 
as we continue to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  we expect to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining our product offerings 
periodically  we review inventory to determine recoverability of items on hand using the lower of cost or market locom and excess methods 
we group and evaluate our products based on their underlying die or wafer type our raw materials  silicon wafers  can generally be used to make multiple products  to determine the total quantity on hand and average unit costs 
management uses judgment in comparing historical sales quantities to the quantity on hand at the end of the fiscal year 
if the quantity on hand exceeds the sales quantities  we provide a valuation allowance for the potentially obsolete or slow moving items 
for the locom analysis  we compare the average historical sales price to the average unit cost of inventories at the end of the fiscal year 
if the average unit cost exceeds the average sales price  we provide a valuation allowance 
with continuing low revenue levels  management felt it necessary to also review our raw materials and work in process 
our products generally exhibit an active sales product life cycle of ten or more years 
however  due to rapid changes in process technology  we are generally unable to obtain wafers for our products for as long a period as their life cycles 
as a result  early in a product s life  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle and purchase materials upfront 
on some occasions  our expectations become lower and we provide a reserve for potential excess materials 
in fiscal and  we increased our inventory valuation allowance by  and  respectively  for potential excess materials 
during fiscal  we wrote off  of inventory against the previously established allowance 
in addition  during fiscal and  we scrapped other inventory of  and  respectively 
we believe our current inventory valuation allowance of  provides a reasonable estimate of the recoverability of inventories at the end of fiscal although current levels of inventory impact our liquidity  we believe that this is a less costly alternative to owning a wafer fabrication facility or continuously redesigning our products to newer process technologies  which would divert limited engineering resources from new product development 
we continue to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify our risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool masks with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for our limited product development resources 
we seek to achieve on going reductions in inventory  although there can be no assurance we will be successful 
in the event economic conditions remain slow  we may consider identifying additional portions of inventory to write off at a future date 
historically  due to customer order scheduling  up to of our quarterly revenues were often shipped in the last month of the quarter  so a large portion of the shipments included in year end accounts receivable were not yet due per our net day terms 
this results in year end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the respective period 
financing while we will continue to evaluate future debt and equity financing opportunities  we believe the cost reductions implemented in the past few years have resulted in the cash flow generated from operations providing an adequate base of liquidity to fund future operating and capital needs 
based on the fact that  as of december   we hold approximately million in cash reserves and available for sale securities and our anticipated cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than our current revenue rate  we believe we can cover our cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
contractual obligations our only contractual obligation is our facility operating lease 
the following table summarizes the future fixed payments under this lease as of september  payment timing may be subject to change 
payments due by period total within year years after years building off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net revenues for fiscal increased one percent from  in fiscal to  this slight increase is the result of one customer increasing its order rate to an amount that offset decreases in older product sales 
cost of revenues for fiscal increased percent from  in fiscal to  mainly the result of write offs of inventory totaling  and a decrease in sales of products previously written down to zero value in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
research and development expenses increased percent from  in fiscal to  while this increase includes the write off of  of capitalized test software development costs  the remaining increase is the result of our continued commitment to expand our product development team  in both numbers and expertise 
while the expenses  net of the write off of capitalized test software development costs  are outside our goal of to percent of net revenues  we believe we must continue at this current level as new product development is the key to our future growth and success 
future new product introductions will result in future revenue increases that will begin to offset these expenditures down to our goal level 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased nine percent from  in fiscal to  while we attempted to identify areas for cost cutting during the fiscal year  the need for outside consultants and the expensing of certain prepaid expenses whose useful life had expired early in the normal course of business resulted in the total increase 
interest income increased percent from  in fiscal to  the increase is the result of more funds being invested in available for sales securities during fiscal and from the fact that the investments existed for the full fiscal year compared to only four months of fiscal as a result of the foregoing  we had a net loss of  for fiscal  compared to net income of  in fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net revenues for fiscal increased percent from  in fiscal to  these increases are due to increases in certain customers order quantity rates and from certain customers returning to their past order quantity rates after a slowdown in fiscal in addition  we experienced a renewed interest in fiscal in military grade products that had been previously written down to zero value 
while net revenues increased percent  cost of revenues decreased by percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this is the result of percent of fiscal net revenues coming from items previously written down to zero value compared to percent in fiscal  and the recognition of favorable standard cost variances from jobs in process at september  that were completed in the current year 
this increase in profitability was partially offset by increases in the inventory reserve totaling  our products generally exhibit an active sales product life cycle of ten or more years 
however  due to rapid changes in process technology  we are generally unable to obtain wafers for our products for as long a period as their life cycles 
as a result  early in a product s life  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle and purchase materials upfront 
on some occasions  our expectations become lower and we provide a reserve for or write down potential excess materials 
recognizing the need to increase new product development  we expanded our research and development team  which resulted in a percent increase in expenses  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal however  this amount remains within our goal of being between to percent of net revenues percent in fiscal 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased nine percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal we are making various changes to our administrative and sales structure  which we believe will increase our visibility to customers  and in turn  increase revenues 
interest income increased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  mainly as a result of increases in our cash balances and investments in higher yield available for sale securities 
other income increased from in fiscal to  in fiscal  as a result of the sale of previously written off fixed assets 
as a result of the foregoing  we had net income of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this report and the data used to prepare them 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and we are required to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
the summary of accounting policies included with the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our judgments  estimates  and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  and valuation of long lived assets 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are the critical accounting policies we believe are affected by significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide the distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
revenues from such sales are recognized upon shipment  with a provision for estimated returns and allowances recorded at that time  if applicable 
while distributors are allowed to return items for stock rotation  they are required to place an order of equal or greater value at the same time 
therefore  no allowance for returns is recorded 
because we generally do not change the pricing of our products more than once a year  there have not been any pricing issues in the past several years  therefore  there is no allowance for price protection recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness  and current economic conditions 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to receivables 
inventories we write down our inventories for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves  and obsolescence reserves 
as a result of production requirements and constraints  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle of a product which can be ten or more years and purchase materials upfront 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
conversely  if demand increases for product types that have been fully reserved  future margins may be higher 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets  are assessed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  or whenever management has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets 
such assets are carried at the lower of book value or fair value as estimated by management based on appraisals  current market value  and comparable sales value  as appropriate 
assets to be held and used affected by such impairment loss are depreciated or amortized at their new carrying amounts over the remaining estimated life  assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are not subject to further depreciation or amortization 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we use undiscounted future cash flows without interest charges compared to the carrying value of the assets 
deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when we are unable to conclude that our deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred income tax assets that may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that we will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of september  accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets as of september  impact of new financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the provisions are effective for the company as of october  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial statements  if any 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the pronouncement clarifies the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial statements  if any 
in september  the sec staff published staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements and considering the effects of prior year uncorrected errors on the statements of operations as well as the balance sheets 
sab no 
does not change the requirements under sab no 
regarding qualitative considerations in assessing the materiality of misstatements 
we adopted sab no 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  and the adoption had no impact on its results of operations or financial condition as of and for the fiscal year ended september  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial statements  if any 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts all of its transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
it is therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and does not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to the company may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of the company s prices relative to the prices of its foreign competitors
