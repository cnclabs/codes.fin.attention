item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion may contain forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward looking statements 
some factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward looking statements are described in item a risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the marketing and sale of marine  aviation and land fuel products and related services on a worldwide basis 
in our marine segment  we offer fuel and related services to a broad base of maritime customers  including international container and tanker fleets and time charter operators  as well as to the united states and foreign governments 
in our aviation segment  we offer fuel and related services to major commercial airlines  second and third tier airlines  cargo carriers  regional and low cost carriers  corporate fleets  fractional operators  private aircraft  military fleets and to the united states and foreign governments 
in our land segment  we offer fuel and related services to petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market 
we compete by providing our customers value added benefits including single supplier convenience  competitive pricing  the availability of trade credit  price risk management  logistical support  fuel quality control and fuel procurement outsourcing 
our revenue and cost of sales are significantly impacted by world oil prices as evidenced in part by our revenue and cost of sales increases year over year 
however  our gross profit is not necessarily impacted by the change in world oil prices as our profitability is driven by gross profit per unit which is not directly correlated to the price of fuel 
therefore  in a period of increasing or decreasing oil prices  our revenue and cost of sales would increase or decrease proportionately but our gross profit may not be negatively or positively impacted by such price changes 
in our marine segment  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and act as brokers for others 
profit from our marine segment is determined primarily by the volume and gross profit achieved on fuel resales and by the volume and commission rate of brokering business 
in our aviation and land segments  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and we do not act as brokers 
profit from our aviation and land segments is primarily determined by the volume and the gross profit achieved on fuel resales 
our profitability in our segments also depends on our operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debts 

table of contents we may experience decreases in future sales volume and margins as a result of deterioration in the world economy  transportation industry  natural disasters and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  because fuel costs represent a significant part of our customers operating expenses  volatile and or high fuel prices can adversely affect our customers businesses  and consequently the demand for our services and our results of operations 
see item a risk factors of this form k 
in april  we acquired tramp oil 
this acquisition primarily added to our marine segment 
the results of operations of this acquisition have been included with our results since april reportable segments we have three reportable operating business segments as of december  marine  aviation and land 
in the first quarter of  we determined that due to expanding business operations  increased infrastructure support and management s approach to reviewing operational results  our activities for fuel sales and related services to the land transportation market would be treated as a separate reportable operating business segment 
prior to this determination  the reporting of our land activities was aggregated with the activities of our aviation reportable operating business segment 
corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage  where possible  or on other factors according to the nature of the activity 
financial information with respect to our business segments is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we evaluate and manage our business segments using the performance measurement of income from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenue and related costs of sales  bad debts  share based payments  derivatives  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when fuel deliveries are made and title passes to the customer  or as fuel related services are performed  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed by each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits above certain amounts  setting and maintaining credit standards  and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon a customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to most of our customers 
accounts receivable are deemed past due based on contractual terms agreed with our customers 

table of contents we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market and industry conditions affecting our customers  and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for estimated credit losses 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see item a risk factors of this form k 
share based payment in january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensations using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees and non employee directors be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
under previous accounting guidance  companies had the option of recognizing the fair value of share based compensation to employees and non employee directors in the financial statements or disclosing the pro forma impact on the statement of income of share based compensation to employees and non employee directors in the notes to the financial statements 
in april  we adopted the fair value accounting provisions of sfas no 
using the prospective method 
therefore  for stock options granted prior to april  we continued to use the intrinsic value method promulgated under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the last stock options granted prior to april became fully vested and exercisable in september because we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
in april  the adoption of sfas no 
r did not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
under fair value accounting of share based payment awards  the grant date fair value of the share based payment is amortized over the vesting period for both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight line basis as compensation expense 
as required by sfas r  annual compensation expense for share based payment is reduced by an expected forfeiture amount on outstanding share based payment 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  forfeiture benefits were recorded as a reduction to compensation expense when the share based payment award was forfeited 
sfas no 
r also requires that cash flows from tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for share based awards excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows prospectively from january  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  such excess tax benefits were presented as operating cash flows 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars 
the estimation of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected term of the stock options and ssars represents the estimated period of time from grant until exercise or conversion and is based on vesting schedules and expected post vesting  exercise and employment termination behavior 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
any adjustment to the historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility would be based on the impact to historical volatility of significant non recurring events that would not be expected in the future 
risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
dividend yields are based on the historical dividends of world fuel over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life  as adjusted for stock splits 

table of contents the estimated fair value of common stock  restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the grant date market value of our common stock  as defined in the respective plans under which they were issued 
derivatives we enter into derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel  and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
we also enter into derivatives in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in interest rates 
all derivatives are recognized as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the balance sheet at estimated fair market value based on quoted market prices or available market information 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for fair value hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge and the hedged item are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
for cash flow hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
we use a three year period in assessing the qualification for our fair value hedges 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when the hedging relationship over an extended period of time is determined to be ineffective 
we assess hedge effectiveness based on total changes in the fair market value of our hedging instruments and hedged items and any ineffectiveness is recognized in the statement of income 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
for additional information on derivatives  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this form k 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents our cost in excess of the estimated fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of acquired companies and the joint venture interest in pafco 
goodwill is not subject to periodic amortization 
instead  it is reviewed annually at year end or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  which is the same as our reporting segments  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting segment is estimated using discounted cash flow and market capitalization methodologies 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded identifiable intangible assets for customer relationships existing at the date of the acquisitions and non compete agreements 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their useful lives that range from five to seven years

net income and diluted earnings per share 
net income for was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to diluted earnings per share for was per share  an increase of per share  or  as compared to liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  as compared to million at december  additionally  we had short term investments of million at december  as compared to million as of december  our primary use of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is to fund the purchase of inventories and finance increased receivables to support business growth relating to sales of fuel to our customers 
we are usually extended unsecured trade credit from our suppliers for our fuel purchases  however  certain suppliers require us to provide a letter of credit 
our ability to fund fuel purchases  obtain trade credit from our suppliers  and provide letters of credit is critical to our business 
increases in oil prices negatively affect liquidity by increasing the amount of cash needed to fund fuel purchases as well as reducing the amount of fuel which we can purchase on an unsecured credit basis from our suppliers 
historically  we have not required significant capital investment in fixed assets for our businesses as we subcontract fueling services and maintain inventory at third party storage facilities 
however  we are currently undertaking the implementation of an enterprise integration project the project  which consists of a company wide financial and commercial information system upgrade 
with respect to the implementation of the project  we currently 
table of contents believe we will incur million in capitalized expenditures and million in costs which are expensed as incurred

our business is funded through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our cash on hand fluctuate primarily based on operating cash flow  most significantly  the timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our suppliers 
our unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to million with a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit and provides us the right to request increases in available borrowings up to an additional million  subject to the approval of the administrative agent 
our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility totaled million  our issued letters of credit totaled million and our issued bank guarantees totaled million 
the revolving credit facility contains certain operating and financial covenants with which we are required to comply 
our failure to comply with the operating and financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party  and impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have certain loans between wholly owned subsidiaries which are eliminated in consolidation 
these loans are not permitted under the revolving credit facility and resulted in our non compliance with one of the revolving credit facility covenants 
on november   we received a waiver for this non compliance for all periods prior to such date and obtained a consent that these loans may remain in place on an ongoing basis 
we also have a separate million unsecured credit line for the issuance of letters of credit from one of the banks participating in our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million under this credit line 
higher interest rates can have a negative effect on our liquidity due to higher costs of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
to mitigate this risk  in part  we entered into two interest rate swaps in march in the amount of million  which reduces our exposure to increases in interest rates 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility  adjusted for the interest rate swaps  was per annum 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for this million increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net income 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for this million increase in cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures primarily relating to the enterprise integration project and the acquisition of the minority ownership interest of tramp oil brasil limitada in partially offsetting these cash usages was a reduction in the net cash outflow related to our short term investments activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million for this million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from our public offering of shares in less net repayments of million under our revolving credit facility in working capital at december  was million  representing an increase of million from working capital at december  
table of contents our accounts receivable amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase in accounts receivable of million was primarily attributable to increased business volume and higher fuel prices in the aviation segment 
at december   the allowance for bad debts was million  an increase of million as compared to december  inventories of million  at december   increased million from december  this increase was due to higher inventory levels and higher unit costs 
prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  at december   decreased million from december  which was primarily due to decreases in prepaid fuel  transaction taxes receivable and deferred tax assets  partially offset by increases in receivables related to derivative contracts 
our current liabilities other than short term debt increased million primarily due to increases in accounts payable and payables related to derivative contracts 
these increases were due to greater business volume and increased fuel prices 
partially offsetting these increases were lower accrued compensation  accrued expenses  transaction taxes payable and customer deposits 
short term and long term debt decreased by million primarily due to the repayment of the final installment of an acquisition promissory note 
stockholders equity amounted to million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity of approximately million was mainly due to million in earnings  million amortization of share based payment awards and million from the exercise of stock options 
partially offsetting these increases was the declaration of million in dividends and approximately million for the purchase of shares for the settlements of employee withholding taxes 
we believe that available funds from existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility  together with cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to obtain financing are based on currently available information 
to the extent this information proves to be inaccurate  or if circumstances change  future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity would be adversely affected 
factors that may affect the availability of trade credit  or other financing  include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities  the state of worldwide credit markets  and our levels of outstanding debt 
in addition  we may decide to raise additional funds to respond to competitive pressures or changes in market conditions  to fund future growth  or to acquire businesses 
financing may not be available when needed or desired on terms favorable to us

fair value measurements 
in september  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements

also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods for that fiscal year

income taxes 
in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the definition of tax position also includes a decision to not file a tax return and an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
the effect of the application of this interpretation could have a significant impact on our financial position 
while we have made substantial progress  we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of fin no 
on our financial position 
we do business in most countries around the world  many of which do not have clear tax rules applicable to our operations 
this lack of clarity in the tax rules creates uncertainty which cannot be easily analyzed or predicted 
the cumulative effect of applying fin no 
will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings with a corresponding adjustment to liabilities as of january  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity we enter into derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel  and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
we also enter into derivatives in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in interest rates 
all derivatives are recognized as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the balance sheet at estimated fair market value based on quoted market prices or available market information 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for fair value hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge and the hedged item are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
for cash flow hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
we use a three year period in assessing the qualification for our fair value hedges 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when the hedging relationship over an extended period of time is determined to be ineffective 
we assess hedge effectiveness based on total changes in the fair market value of our hedging instruments and hedged items and any ineffectiveness is recognized in the statement of income 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
cash flow hedges 
we enter into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december  and  our unrealized net gains on these interest rate swaps was thousand and thousand  respectively  which were included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
fair value hedges 
we enter into derivatives in order to hedge price risk associated with our inventories 
effective july   fair value hedge accounting has been applied to hedged inventory 
accordingly  inventories designated as hedged items are marked to market through the statement of income  as is the derivative that serves as the hedge 
as a result  gains and losses attributable to changes in fuel prices offset based on the effectiveness of the hedge in the period in which the hedge is in effect 
for these fair value hedges  we recorded an unrealized net gain of million as of december  and an unrealized net loss of as of december  hedge ineffectiveness resulted in an unrealized gain of million for and a realized loss of million for non designated derivatives 
our non designated derivatives are primarily entered into in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel in the form of swaps as well as fixed price purchase and sale contracts and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
in addition  non designated derivatives are also entered into to hedge foreign currency fluctuation 
the changes in fair value of our non designated derivatives are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
we recorded an unrealized net gain of thousand as of december  and an unrealized net loss of thousand as of december

however  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate protection arrangements that  in effect  fix the rate of interest on our debt 
the amount of debt covered by such arrangements may change depending on our working capital needs 
as of december   we had entered into two interest rate protection arrangements in the form of interest rate swaps  for the entire million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swaps expire equally in march and april as of december   our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility adjusting for the interest rate swaps was per annum 
accordingly  until the expiration of one of our interest rate swaps  our future earnings per share would not be impacted by any interest rate changes on the million outstanding balance at december  foreign currency the majority of our business transactions are denominated in united states dollars 
however  in certain markets  primarily mexico  colombia and the united kingdom  payments to our aviation fuel suppliers and from some of our customers are denominated in local currencies 
this subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk 
although we use hedging strategies to manage and attempt to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange risk  at any given time  only a portion of such risk may be hedged 
as of december   we had the following foreign currency purchase contracts in thousands settlement period hedge strategy foreign currency amount united states currency amount fair value asset liability january non designated clp   non designated gbp
