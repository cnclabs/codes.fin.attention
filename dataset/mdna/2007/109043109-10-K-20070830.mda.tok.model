the decrease is primarily due to lower sales volumes in both segments 
engines segment net sales were billion compared to billion in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in engine unit shipments between years 
the shipment decline is due to a reduction of engine shipments for portable generators caused by a lack of events  such as hurricanes  that cause power outages 
the reminder of the decrease is due to lower retail demand for lawn and garden equipment in the us along with a smaller market share in europe 
unfavorable weather conditions and various economic factors contributed to difficult market conditions for lawn and garden products 
pricing improvements and the impact of favorable euro exchange rates in fiscal were almost entirely offset by an unfavorable mix shift to smaller displacement  lower priced engines

approximately million of the decrease was the result of the anticipated reduction of murray branded lawn and garden product sold to retailers 
excluding murray branded product  lawn and garden equipment sales were comparable between years 
the remainder of the net sales decrease was primarily due to a reduction of portable generator unit shipments because of no landed hurricane activity in fiscal and lower pre hurricane season sales

engines segment gross profit margins decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal approximately million of the decline is attributable to expense incurred with the write down of assets primarily associated with the rationalization of a major operating plant in the united states 
the balance of the reduction resulted primarily from lower sales and production volumes  and increased costs for raw materials 
lower unit sales negatively impacted fiscal margins by approximately million

the decrease is primarily due to lower sales volumes in both segments 
engines segment net sales were billion versus billion in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in engine unit shipments between years 
the shipment decline is attributable to softer retail demand for lawn and garden equipment and efforts by retailers and oems to control inventory levels in the wake of reduced demand 
this unit shipment decline was partially offset by million from a price increase implemented in the beginning of the fiscal year  as well as a favorable mix of engine unit shipments 
power products net sales were billion in both fiscal and lower volumes in fiscal of million for pressure washer and lawn and garden equipment sales were almost fully offset by million of increased volume and pricing on generators as well as million from a favorable mix of lawn and garden product 
management believes the decline in volume of lawn and garden and pressure washer sales is attributable to lower consumer discretionary spending  which resulted in lower demand at retailers 
gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of the volume decreases noted above offset by pricing improvements in both segments 
engines segment margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in margin is attributable to the price increase discussed above as well as million in gains on the sale of operating assets 
in addition  ongoing cost reduction programs contributed million to the margin 
these positive margin enhancers were enough to overcome the impact of a production volume decline  a mix of product that favored lower margin units and other manufacturing cost increases 
the power products segment margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline is primarily attributable to million in losses associated with the wind down of operations at the murray  inc operating facility and the write off of excess inventory related to murray product 
partially offsetting these losses was million in pricing improvements  primarily on generators 
engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative costs increased million between years 
excluding the impact of the million write off of the murray  inc trade receivable that occurred in fiscal the category increased million between years 
increases in this category in fiscal as compared to fiscal included million from the expensing of stock based compensation in fiscal  million in increased legal fees associated with litigation  million associated with increased information technology spending  and million from increased engineering costs associated with new product development in the power products segment

interest expense interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is attributable to higher borrowings between years associated with the term notes used for the murray  inc asset acquisition in february other income other income decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is attributed primarily to higher deferred financing expenses 
deferred financing expense increased as a result of the acceleration of debt repayments and the write off of associated deferred financing costs 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was approximately in both fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million less than the prior year 
the primary reason for the decrease is due to net income being lower by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in net income was partially offset by non cash impairment charges of million in fiscal in addition  higher fourth quarter sales within our engines segment increased working capital requirements for accounts receivable by million partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million higher than the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase is lower working capital requirements in fiscal lower fourth quarter sales in fiscal resulted in higher inventory levels offset by lower receivables and accrued liabilities including rebates  incentive compensation and income taxes 
the reduction in net income between years was more than offset by a series of increased non cash items in fiscal including non cash pension charges  stock compensation expense  gains on fixed asset sales  the deferred tax credit  and the elimination of the extraordinary gain 
the fiscal cash flows from operations were million higher than the prior year 
fiscal did not experience the significant increase in inventories experienced in  resulting in a million improvement in cash flows in fiscal during fiscal  inventories for engines and power products were increased to what management believes were a more normal level 
accordingly  no such incremental inventory build up was required in fiscal offsetting the favorable impact of inventory levels on cash flows was a million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities between years 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million reduction in incentive compensation accruals between years and million in lower rebate accruals 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these cash flows include capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures relate primarily to reinvestment in equipment  capacity additions and new products 
during fiscal  we increased our engines segment capacity by opening a new plant in ostrava  czech republic which accounted for million of capital expenditures 
this new plant began production in december in addition  the power products segment is adding lawn and garden product capacity with a new plant in newbern  tennessee that accounted for million of capital expenditures in fiscal this plant is expected to begin production in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  briggs stratton received million in cash from the sale of certain operating assets

the company received million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options 
the stock option activity is a direct reflection of the market value of the company s stock and option strike prices that encourage the exercise of the options 
future liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  the company had no borrowings outstanding under its million revolving credit facility that was to expire in may on july   the company entered into a million amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement revolver provides a revolving credit facility for up to million in revolving loans  including up to million in swing line loans 
the company will use proceeds of the revolver to  among other things  pay off amounts outstanding under the company s term loan agreement dated february  with various financial institutions 
the revolver will also be used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs 
at any time during the term of the revolver  the company may  so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are satisfied  elect to increase the maximum amount available under the revolver from million by up to an amount not to exceed million through  at the company s election  increases of commitments by existing lenders and or the addition of new lenders 
the revolver has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the revolver will be due and payable on july  on august   briggs stratton announced its intent to initiate repurchases of up to million of its common stock through open market transactions during fiscal and fiscal the timing and amount of actual purchases will depend upon certain governing loan covenants 
as of august   approximately million of common stock has been repurchased under this plan 
briggs stratton expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in equipment  new products  and capacity enhancements 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund briggs stratton s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial strategy management believes that the value of briggs stratton is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that briggs stratton has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
several successful joint ventures and the acquisition of generac portable products  inc and simplicity are examples of our successful execution of this strategy 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  we should return capital to the capital providers through dividends and or stock buy backs 
off balance sheet arrangements briggs stratton has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
briggs stratton s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
briggs stratton is subject to financial and operating restrictions in addition to certain financial covenants under its domestic debt agreements 
as is fully disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  these restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends  incur further indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale and or leaseback transactions  consolidate  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of our assets 
we believe we will remain in compliance with these covenants in fiscal briggs stratton has obligations concerning certain employee benefits including its pension plans  postretirement benefit obligations and deferred compensation arrangements 
all of these obligations are recorded on our balance sheets and disclosed more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases consulting agreement other matters labor agreement briggs stratton has collective bargaining agreements with its unions 
these agreements expire at various times ranging from emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has developed national emission standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines 
briggs stratton currently has a complete product offering that complies with the epa s phase ii engine emission standards 
the epa issued proposed phase iii standards to further reduce engine exhaust emissions and to control evaporative emissions from small off road engines and equipment they are used in 
the proposed standards are similar to those adopted by the california air resources board carb 
the proposed phase iii program would require some evaporative controls in and go into full effect in for class ii engines cubic centimeter displacement and larger and for class i engines less than cubic centimeter displacement 
briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
carb s tier regulation requires additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions and new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 
the tier regulation is phased in between and depending upon the size of the engine and type of control 
while briggs stratton believes the cost of the regulation may increase engine costs per unit  briggs stratton does not believe the regulation will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
this assessment is based on a number of factors  including revisions the carb made to its adopted regulation from the proposal published in september in response to recommendations from briggs stratton and others in the regulated category and intention to pass increased costs associated with the regulation on to consumers 
the european commission adopted an engine emission directive regulating exhaust emissions from engines manufactured by briggs stratton 
the directive parallels the regulations previously promulgated by the us epa 
stage was effective in february and stage phases in between calendar years and  with some limited extensions available for specific size and type engines until briggs stratton s full european product line has been compliant with stage since briggs stratton has certified the majority of its class engines to be compliant with the stage standards and intends to have a full european product line compliant with stage before the end of calendar year briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the directive will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies briggs stratton s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable and inventory reserves  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates  pension obligations  postretirement benefits  warranty  product liability  litigation and taxation 
the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the company s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded tax related assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at july  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody s aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  including inflation assumptions and active management of the plan s invested assets 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of the company s pension plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 
at july  the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense or income are also calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by million 
for pension and postretirement benefits  actuarial gains and losses are accounted for in accordance with gaap 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  at this time  the impact of adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial position is being assessed

sfas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a postretirement benefit plan in the statement of financial position  as well as recognition of changes in that funded status through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 
sfas also requires a change in the measurement of a plan s assets and benefit obligations as of the end date of the employer s fiscal year 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december   except for the measurement date provisions  which are effective for fiscal years ending after december  see note pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the company s adoption of sfas in its fiscal year 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin details how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions that have been or expect to be taken 
as such  financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
fin is effective for public companies for annual periods that begin after december  briggs stratton corporation is required to and intends to adopt the provisions of fin as of july  the cumulative effect of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for fiscal we have evaluated the impact of fin and do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas no 

sfas no 
seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk briggs stratton is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  briggs stratton uses financial instruments 
briggs stratton does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency briggs stratton s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against various currencies  with the japanese yen and the euro as the most significant 
the yen is used to purchase engines from briggs stratton s joint venture 
briggs stratton purchases components in euros from third parties and receives euros for certain products sold to european customers 
briggs stratton s foreign subsidiaries earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of the local currency against the us dollar as these subsidiaries previously purchased inventory from the parent in us dollars 
starting mid year of fiscal  subsidiaries make these purchases in euros 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at july   briggs stratton had the following forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with the fair value gains losses shown in thousands hedge notional fair market conversion gain loss currency value value currency at fair value japanese yen us euro us australian dollars us all of the above contracts expire within twelve months 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the shareholders investment in briggs stratton 
amounts invested in briggs stratton s non us subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year end 
the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders investment as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of shareholders investment increased million during the year 
using the year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in non us subsidiaries on july  was approximately million 
interest rates briggs stratton is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings  depending on general economic conditions 
on july   briggs stratton had the following short term loans outstanding in thousands weighted average currency amount interest rate us dollars this loan has a variable interest rate
