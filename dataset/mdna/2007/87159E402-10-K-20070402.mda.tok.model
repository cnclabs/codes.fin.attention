phs concentrates on what it perceives to be faster moving promotional items such as tide  bounty  nyquil  pantene  clorox bleach  scott tissues  marcal tissues among many others  and uses promotions  logistics and distribution savings to streamline and reduce its sale prices and increase gross profit thereby 
the second business segment within the company s sector wherein phs participates was previously proset hair systems proset but proset discontinued its operations in the th quarter of fy as further discussed infra 
in the third quarter of phs entered the private label grocery market specializing in the distribution of baking mixes and spices to national chains on a proprietary basis 
phs hopes to develop private label programs for national accounts by creating proprietary baking mix products and spice plan o grams specifically designed for particular retail needs 
phs further hopes to expand its grocery distribution business by complementing the distribution of its promotional grocery and hba items with higher margin secondary items that would blend a higher margin into phs operations

corporate expenses such as legal  accounting  corporate employees and regulatory costs as well as depreciation costs primarily represent the difference between the company s consolidated results and operating results 
management believes that its corporate expenses may increase as a result of additional regulatory requirements that have been enacted by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the company is and will likely continue to be required to comply with those and additional governance and financial regulations that will likely result in additional corporate expenses

in order to better understand the company s financial historical status and performance a discussion of the company s segments and their respective financial results follow  phs group grocery and hba operations phs group distributes grocery and hba products to retailers and wholesalers predominately located in the northeastern united states  as well as in canada 
phs constitutes the largest segment of the company s operations from a financial prospective  representing about of the overall company sales 
phs s core sales base remains the distribution of nationally branded consumer products in the grocery and health and beauty hba sectors 
phs has positioned itself as a distributor for major manufacturers as opposed to a full line wholesaler 
a full line wholesaler has the responsibility of servicing the entire needs of a retail operation  where as a distributor caters to specific merchandising categories 
as a result  phs is able to plan the needs of its customers directly from the source of supply which in turn is designed to increase sales to its customers through this unique focus 
phs concentrates on what it perceives to be the fastest moving consumer product items and uses promotional savings to streamline and reduce their sale prices 
phs focuses on approximately  products manufactured by the top grocery and hba companies in the united states and as a result the company believes that they have a competitive advantage in comparison to the traditional wholesaler  which may concentrate on over  different items

as an example  special packaging was created for folgers  marcal paper  crest displays as well as gain detergent among others  with unique retail display features  that phs has been able to strongly promote during fy as opposed to marketing those products for normal replenishment 
the company believes that promotional displays allow phs to sell better mixes of product as well as introduce new items in combination with regularly stocked items 
as long as the company maintains or expands its vendor relationships  management believes that it can continue to improve its operating results 
however  the company is dependant on promotional allowances and any material changes to manufacturers allowances will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results

bill rancic  founder of caw at www

com and donald trump s first apprentice on the popular nbc tv program  was on hand for the store s grand opening 
one of the attractions of the new store is the membership program  which enables club members to rent a climate controlled locker to keep their personal cache in an optimally controlled temperature and humidity environment 
management believes that the club has the potential to provide an additional revenue stream to the strong sales we continue to see in the cigar division 
upcoming events include plans for a father s day celebration in the lounge of cigars around the world similar to the grand opening 
fathers will be given the special treatment the company believes that they deserve as well as exceptional discounts on their favorite cigars 
caw plans nfl weekends as the football season starts and a super bowl event next year 
based upon this model and the perceived results thereof  caw is exploring other retail opportunities to expand this concept 
the store s grand opening celebration received coverage by local media including wsvn tv  fox  wplg tv  abc  waxy am  the ticket  the miami herald  the miami lakes  and the miami new times 
revenues in the company s bc operation for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  caw on a current operating basis represented approximately of bc revenues for the year ended december  gross profit for year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the table above provides comparative details for the company s bc operation 
caw is operating profitably  but the logistical needed for support of the miami lakes  florida operations is consuming much of the segment s resources and thereby slowing it to show a profit at those sales levels 
the on line segment has over  customers  generates an average order of  with over a repeat rate and generates at a fulfillment rate 
the company believes that building its bc segment brands along with popularity of bill rancic  the winner of the abc show the apprentice should bring the segment effective critical mass 
discontinued operations the company discontinued proset s operation in the fourth quarter of and such discontinuance is reflected in the financial statements hereinafter provided 
the prior proset segment of the company s business has never been considered a significant component thereof 
after review of the relevant components required for measuring the importance of and particulars of the proset segment  the company determined that the lessened value to the company of proset s revenues because of the cost factor did not warrant continuing its operations because such revenues had not become sufficient to sustain the costs of its operations 
proset has not been able to acquire and sell salon hair care products at costs needed to market those products profitably 
in addition  proset s inventory could not be replenished at appropriate levels to accommodate customers needs as determined by the company 
proset has continued to operate at a loss and management believed that there is little likelihood of establishing a plan to bring such segment profitable 
management further believes that the expansion of its profitable grocery operations will provide for vertical growth that may require additional capital that would be better invested in phs operations rather then proset operations

the company s working capital increased by million in fy to million due to a combination of several factors including amortization of debt  refinancing of short term debt to long term debts and operating profits from phs group 
receivables including trade and other receivables increased by million due to revenue increases and vendor rebates 
the company plans to further improve its working capital through conversion of short term debt to long term debt  increasing its operating profit  reducing its financing expenses and the utilization of equity financing 
the company needed million to support cash needed for operating activities 
the predominant need for cash involved the increase of accounts receivable by million 
the company supported this need through an increase of its utilization of lines of credit  additional equity and debt instruments 
in addition  improved operating performance by phs group contributed to the operating needs of the company 
the company financed its operating activities by issuing million in notes in the first quarter of  and utilized its asset based financing facilities and trade financing for million in the fourth quarter of liquidity for the company predominately involves the need to finance accounts receivables  inventory  interest and operating expenses 
the cash flow realized from the company s gross profit has been sufficient to cover the company s operating expenses 
however  the company relies on debt and equity financing in order to support the interest that it pays in support of financing its receivables and inventory 
the company has not been able to date to completely support its financing costs solely from operations and has relied on equity and debt financing to bridge the gap 
the company generated a net loss attributable to common shareholders of approximately  in financing costs totaled  and non cash charges totaled approximately  for the period 
reductions in financing expenses through equity conversions and debt repayments through operating or capital transactions have been and should continue to be beneficial to the company s performance 
the capital resources that were available to the company consisted of million in lines of credit  million in short term notes  million of non redeemable preferred and million in long term notes as of december  the company s objective is to reduce its notes through the issuance of equity and cash flow as well as refinancing its current obligations with debit with lower rates 
towards such goal  in the first quarter of the company refinanced it s million dollar senior line of credit with a million year term facility and reduced its interest rate to 
however there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve its stated objectives 
achieving these goals and objectives is believed material to the company s success 
the company s liquidity relies in material part on the turnover of it inventory and accounts receivable 
the company has for the last fiscal year turned its receivables on average every days and the company has turned its overall inventory on average approximately every days 
the company believes that its collection procedures and procurement policies are consistent with industry standards 
however  nearly of the company s assets consist of trade receivables and inventory 
the company must maintain a strict policy on insuring collections of receivables and adequate procurement based upon customer demands to optimize its profit potential 
the company s sales are reliant in significant part on extending credit that ranges from to days 
as a result  the company must have financing facilities that will continue to allow the company to procure inventory and extend accounts receivable credits 
the company has strict credit policies and reviews  however credit extensions may pose material financial risks to the company 
in addition the company relies on performance incentives from its manufacturers that are based upon sales 
provided the company maintains its performance standards with the manufacturers with whom it contracts for procurement of goods its estimates of incentives that are due should remain accurate 
however  if the respective manufactures change their policies or the company does not meet the manufacturers standards  incentives may be reduced 
management believes that continued cost containment  improved financial and operating controls  debt reduction  and a focused sales and marketing effort should provide sufficient cash flow from operations in the near term and the company is working toward reliance on such financial sources and attributes to cover its cash flow requirements but achievement of these goals  however  will likely continue to be dependent upon the company s attainment of increased revenues  improved operating costs  reduced financing cost and trade support levels that are consistent with management s plans 
such operating performance will likely continue to be subject to financial  economic and other factors likely to be beyond its control  and there can be no assurance that the company s goals will be achieved 
in the interim while such goals are being pursued achievement of positive cash flow has been and continues to be reliant on equity and debt financing  including the company s exchange of notes payable for common shares and its issuance of further common and preferred stock in private placements and the company is hopeful that the market will continue to recognize the company s stature so that such financing method will continue to be available in the future because  at least in the near future  the company is likely to continue to use such financing opportunities to maintain adequate cash flow

critical accounting policies 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management uses authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable are due from businesses engaged in the distribution of grocery  health and beauty products as well as from consumers who purchase health and beauty products and premium handmade cigars from the company s web sites 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and  generally  collateral may be required 
accounts receivable are due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the company s historical collections experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historical write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality of its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of reserves  which have been deducted for financial statement purposes  but have not been deducted for income tax purposes as well as net operating loss carry forwards 
the company annually reviews the deferred tax asset accounts to determine if is appears more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
at december   the company has established a full valuation allowance 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets periodically to determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with expected net cash flows expected to be provided by the operating activities of the business or related products 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  the company would determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets and their ultimate disposition 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset

in september  the fasb issued no 
 fair value measurements

sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognizing  classification interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we believe that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact of our consolidated financial statements 
for our company  this interpretation will be effective beginning january  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
in september sab expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the process of quantifying the materiality of financial misstatements 
sab requires both the balance sheet and income statement approaches be used when quantifying the materiality of misstatement amounts 
in addition  sab contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach and provides transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years 
sab was effective in the company s fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
seasonality sales by phs group usually peak at the end of the calendar quarter  when the company s suppliers offer promotions which lower prices and  in turn  the company is able to lower its prices and increase sales volume 
suppliers tend to promote at quarter end and as a result reduced products costs may increase sales 
in particular  the first and second quarters are usually better operating quarters 
sales of beauty care products and fragrances increase over traditional gift giving holidays such as christmas  mother s day  father s day  and valentine s day 
cigar product sales also increase during holiday periods and summer months as well as around special sporting events 
inflation the company believes that inflation  under certain circumstances  could be beneficial to the company s major business  phs group 
when inflationary pressures drive product costs up  the company s customers sometimes purchase greater quantities of product to expand their inventories to protect against further pricing increases 
this enables the company to sell greater quantities of products that are sensitive to inflationary pressures 
however  inflationary pressures frequently increase interest rates 
since the company is dependent on financing  any increase in interest rates will increase the company s credit costs  thereby reducing its profits 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does rely partly not to any material extent on variable interest rate debt instruments representing less than in amount of all working capital financing  and the company does not therefore consider there to be any overall material market risk potentially derived from the existence of such loan terms see md a supra for further details regarding existing variable interest rate instruments 
the company does not believe that it has any other potential market risk sensitive financial instruments
