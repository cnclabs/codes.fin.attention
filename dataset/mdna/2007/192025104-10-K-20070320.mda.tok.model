currently  there are three federal regulatory definitions of capital that take the form of minimum ratios 
table capital ratios  shows that the corporation and peoplesbank were well capitalized on december  a more detailed analysis of the factors and trends affecting corporate earnings follows 
income statement analysis net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in interest rates  volumes and the composition or mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for analytical purposes  tables   and are presented on a tax equivalent basis to make it easier to compare taxable and tax exempt assets 
income from tax exempt assets  primarily loans to or securities issued by state and local governments  is increased by the amount of federal income taxes which would have been incurred if the income was taxable at the statutory rate of percent 
unless otherwise noted  the discussion that follows is based on interest income and interest expense as reported in the consolidated statements of income  not on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income for was  an increase of  or percent above the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the volume of earning assets 
earning assets averaged million and yielded percent tax equivalent basis for  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in earning assets occurred primarily in business loans and secondarily in consumer loans 
rising market interest rates resulted in increases in yields on variable rate business loans  investment securities and overnight investments  which also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million at an average rate of percent for  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities occurred primarily in money market deposits and floating rate cds 
current period deposit growth was attributable to several factors including the successful introduction of new money market products  the addition of two financial centers in march  and higher market interest rates  which improved returns for bank depositors 
funding costs also increased as a result of issuing million in floating rate trust preferred debt in june  as a capital strategy to support planned balance sheet growth 
a flat yield curve  a growing reliance on interest rate sensitive funding sources  and competitive pricing pressures all contributed to the decrease in net interest margin  which was percent tax equivalent basis for  compared to percent for net interest margin is net interest income tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets 
in the period ahead  management expects that growth in net interest income will remain constrained by the flat or inverted us treasury yield curve environment and competitive pricing pressures 
comparatively  net interest income for was  an increase of  or percent above the increase was primarily the result of an increase in loan volume  although an increase in loan yields and fees also contributed

the provision reflects management s judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the risk management section  including tables nonperforming assets  analysis of allowance for loan losses  and allocation of allowance for loan losses  of this report  provides detailed information about the allowance  provision and credit risk 
for  the provision expense for loan losses was  compared to  for and  for the current period provision was based on management s assessment of overall credit quality  loan growth  particularly commercial and commercial real estate loans  which are inherently more risky than other types of loans  and macro economic factors 
macro economic factors included heightened energy costs and market interest rates  and a downturn in the real estate market  which could portend debt service problems for some of our borrowers 
as reported on form k  filed by codorus valley on february   peoplesbank received a check for approximately  the check represented peoplesbank s portion of a million restitution

the check partially reimbursed peoplesbank for loan losses that were incurred in and that pertained to a group of related equipment leasing contracts that peoplesbank acquired from a third party broker who designated bank of new york as escrow agent for payments under these contracts 
management plans to recognize this recovery as a credit to the loan loss provision in the first quarter of noninterest income the following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past three years 
a key operating strategy is to increase noninterest or fee based income by offering new services  enhancing traditional services and expanding sales into new geographic markets

acre  to the local township for a road throughway 
one parcel was held by codorus valley bancorp  inc and the other was held by its subsidiary  peoplesbank

comparatively  gains increased  or percent above due to an increase in the volume of mortgage loan originations and sales 
loss gain on sales of securities for and the corporation recognized losses of  and  respectively  from the sale of securities in connection with an investment swap 
a swap entails selling low yielding investments at a loss investments purchased in a low interest rate environment and replacing them with higher yielding investments  which increases portfolio yield and interest income in future periods

current period problem loan and foreclosed real estate carrying costs increased  above  due primarily to the recognition of an unusually large  gain from the sale of loan collateral in the level of current period expense also reflected a larger portfolio of nonaccrual loans 
current period miscellaneous expense reflected the recognition of two non recurring expenses 
the first was a  loss charge off on architectural drawings for a branch office prototype that did not materialize 
the second was a  expense for services to create a manuscript of the history of peoplesbank  which management plans to use for client appreciation and promotional purposes

a primary responsibility of the committee is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes six basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed preestablished dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation directly lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern maryland 
although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers minimizes this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
and sixth  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein 
in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
in addition to internal controls  loan portfolios are reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 

table of contents one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
at year end  the corporation had one industry concentration that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio  real estate construction and land development  which was percent of the portfolio 
comparatively  at year end  real estate construction and land development was percent of the portfolio  and commercial real estate leasing was percent of the portfolio 
commercial leasing pertains to borrowers who lease real estate for business purposes 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate 
nonperforming assets table nonperforming assets  presents asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss 
management generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  are contractually past due  but well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the final category  foreclosed real estate  is real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to peoplesbank 
table also provides a summary of nonperforming assets and related ratios

the corporation recognizes interest income on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans 
on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio was  compared to  on december  the  increase was attributable to the addition of two unrelated business loans with outstanding principal balances at year end of  and  respectively 
in management s judgment  the  loan  which has matured  is adequately secured both by collateral based on a recent independent appraisal  and personal guarantees  which should ensure the 
table of contents ultimate recovery of interest and principal in full 
the net realizable value of the collateral for the  loan was deemed insufficient 
accordingly  management has established a  loss allowance for this account 
on december   nonaccrual loans were comprised of unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  management and the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly 
collection efforts  including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts based on prevailing market conditions and liquidation of collateral assets  are being employed to maximize recovery 
foreclosed real estate  net of allowance  was  on december   compared to  on december  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of a property in satisfaction of a delinquent mortgage loan 
in january  this property was sold resulting in a principal loss of approximately  the provision expense for foreclosed real estate  due to declines in the fair value of individual assets  was for  compared to  for and  for on december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans for which management has doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which were not disclosed in table a loss allowance is established for those potential problem loans that in management s judgment were inadequately collateralized 
comparatively  management was monitoring approximately million in potential problem loans on december  allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio at december  the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 
in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance  management considers the results of internal and external credit reviews  past loss experience  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adequacy of collateral  general economic conditions and the local business outlook 
all of these factors are susceptible to significant change 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which are often subjective and fluid 
table presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses represents probable losses inherent in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated allowance analyses  such as industry concentrations  imprecision in the loan risk evaluation process and current economic factors 
the allowance was  or

percent  respectively  on december  the  or percent increase in the allowance was based on management s estimate to bring the allowance to a level reflective of risk in the portfolio  loan growth  and macro economic factors such as the heightened level of energy costs and interest rates  and a downturn in the real estate market 
these factors contributed to an increase in the unallocated component in as noted in table based on a recent evaluation of probable loan losses in the current portfolio  management believes that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the loan portfolio on december

furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire loan portfolio 

table of contents liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
retained earnings from profitable operations are another source of liquidity 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
for  management believes that liquidity was more than adequate based on the level of overnight investment  the potential liquidation of a million portfolio of available for sale securities  valued at december   and available credit from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
on september   the latest available date  available funding from the fhlbp was approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was percent for year end  compared to percent for year end the decrease in this ratio was the result of strong deposit growth 
management believes that the addition of two financial centers in march of will continue to provide liquidity in the form of new deposits 
off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist mainly of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit of this report and totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 
accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank 
contractual obligations table contractual obligations  presents the amount and timing of payments due under long term contractual obligations

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
as discussed below in the market risk management section  management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management in the normal course of conducting business  the corporation is exposed to market risk  principally interest rate risk  through the operations of its banking subsidiary  peoplesbank 
interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that may affect cash flows  income  expense and the values of financial instruments 
peoplesbank is particularly vulnerable to changes in short term interest rates such as the prime rate and libor 
an asset liability committee committee comprised of members of senior management manages interest rate risk 
the committee s objective is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk and within capital adequacy constraints 
peoplesbank is not subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk and it does not own any trading assets 
the committee manages interest rate risk primarily through sensitivity analysis 
asset liability management simulation software alm model is used to model and measure the potential loss in future net income based on hypothetical changes in interest rates 
interest rate forecasts are supplied by a national forecasting service and integrated with the alm model 
the corporation s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net income is percent over a twelve month period 
this policy limit is tested on a quarterly basis by measuring the change in net income from a baseline scenario where interest rates are held constant  to a high rate scenario gradual basis point increase in prime and fed funds rates  a low rate scenario gradual basis point decrease in prime and fed funds rates and a most likely scenario defined by a forecasting service over the future twelve month period 
important alm modeling assumptions include the use of a static balance sheet and contractual cash flows  varying levels of prepayments for loans and mortgage backed securities  stability of noninterest income and expense  reinvestment of repriceable cash flows in the same type of asset or liability  and constant product rate spreads  determined at the balance sheet date  over the twelve month measurement period 
the alm model also includes significant balance sheet characteristics such as rate caps and floors 
for year end  management presumed that in all scenarios trust preferred investment securities  which are callable at a premium  would be called by the issuers due to the relatively high coupon rate and would result in a one time increase in interest income 

table of contents the corporation performed a financial simulation on the balance sheet for december  and the results of these point in time analyses are shown in table for year end  the alm model portrayed a balance sheet that was liability sensitive 
liability sensitivity means that deposits and debt are likely to re price to a greater and faster degree than the loans and investments that they fund 
this suggests that net income may increase if market interest rates  particularly short term rates  decrease 
conversely  net income would be expected to decrease if market interest rates increase 
from june through june  short term market interest rates have systematically increased in response to economic tightening by the federal reserve  while long term interest rates remained relatively stable  or in some cases declined slightly 
during the flat slightly inverted us treasury yield curve environment that prevailed in many loan clients showed a preference for fixed rate loans to lock in rates  while deposit clients preferred variable or floating rate deposit products with short maturities 
the result was a gradual shift in the balance sheet to a liability sensitive position for year end  compared to a more neutral interest rate risk position for year end table interest rate sensitivity forecasted interest rate scenario change in interest rates ramped over months basis points change in net income s at december  most likely high flat baseline low at december  most likely high flat baseline low measurement of interest rate risk requires many assumptions 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower rates on net income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including timing of cash flows  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  customer behavior  changes in market conditions  and management strategies
