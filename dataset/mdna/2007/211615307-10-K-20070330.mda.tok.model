item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview as discussed in item  business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
within these two industry groups  the company has identified two reportable segments in each of the two industry groups the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  williams furnace co 
wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  phoenix manufacturing  inc pmi of phoenix  arizona 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are offered from numerous locations along the front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries castle concrete company and transit mix concrete co  of colorado springs  transit mix of pueblo  inc of pueblo and rocky mountain ready mix concrete  inc of denver 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mckinney door and hardware  inc of pueblo  colorado 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services and an other classification is used to report a real estate operation 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal and weather sensitive except for fan coils 
revenues in the company s concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment are influenced by the level of construction activity and weather conditions along the front range of colorado 
sales for the door segment are not as strongly seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in colorado and the seasonal sales of the evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
this seasonal pattern has prevailed in and is expected to continue in cash and cash equivalents were  at the end of compared to  at the prior year end 
operations in provided  of cash compared to  in and  generated in the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in was due to changes in working capital  principally an increase in receivables of  during compared to a decrease in receivables of  during the increase in receivables was largely due to the increased sales in all segments during the fourth quarter of compared to and to some slowing of collections at our colorado businesses 
the increase in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was due to changes in net working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was  in   in  and  in capital expenditures for  and were   and  respectively  exclusive of those assets purchased as part of the asci and cssl acquisitions 
current year expenditures were predominantly in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
the expenditures included  for the first outlay on an industrial sand plant while the remaining additions consisted primarily of routine equipment replacements 
expenditures during included completion of a batch plant in pueblo and fines recovery system for the colorado springs sand operation as well as the capitalization of subsidized leasehold improvements in the new office space leased for the corporate office 
the capital expenditures in included a new batch plant in pueblo west and a truck tracking system 
an additional  was used in for the purchase of the asci and cssl assets 
on january  the company purchased the assets of cssl for  in cash including  of goodwill and  for a non compete agreement 
on june   the company purchased certain assets of asci for  of cash and a  note remaining balance due on the note at december  is 
in addition to the  of trucks  equipment and concrete plant  the asci purchase price included  for a non compete agreement   for a restrictive land covenant   for existing customer relations and  of goodwill 
investing activities provided cash from the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment amounting to   and  during  and  respectively 
the sales were mainly of equipment replaced during the year 
the sales of an excess parcel of land adjacent to one of the colorado springs batch plants and the site of the closed pueblo west plant accounted for  of the cash proceeds 
in addition  during the company received a note for  related to one of the property sales 
sales of two parcels of real estate generated  of the proceeds 
budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  which is approximately  more than planned depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the budget includes  for a new door fabrication facility in colorado springs 
the purchase of equipment to increase production in the heating and cooling segment is also planned 
the remaining expenditures are primarily for routine replacement and upgrades 
the company expects that the expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during  cash of  was provided by financing activities 
as more fully discussed in note  the principal amount of the term loan was increased by  during  primarily to fund the acquisition of the assets of asci 
the balance of the additional term loan proceeds will be used for business expansion 
see additional discussion of the term loan under revolving credit and term loan agreement  below 
scheduled debt repayments of  were made during the year 
in addition  scheduled payments of  were made against the  note issued as part of the purchase price of asci leaving a balance due of  at december  during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
the principal amount of the term loan was increased by  during approximately  of the proceeds were used to fund the purchase of the company s stock under the modified dutch auction tender offer completed during the second quarter  and to pay related fees and expenses 
under the company s ongoing share repurchase program  an additional  was used to acquire shares during a total of  shares were acquired during scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year 
during  the remaining outstanding options were exercised for  shares  shares net of  shares tendered as payment of option price which generated proceeds of  for the company and resulted in a  tax benefit the tax benefit is classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year including the final  due on capital lease obligations 
under the company s ongoing share repurchase program  cash of  was used to acquire  shares during revolving credit and term loan agreement the company signed a revolving credit and term loan agreement credit agreement with lasalle bank national association and fifth third bank during september on june   the company entered into a fourth amendment to the credit agreement 
this fourth amendment increased the principal amount of the term loan portion of the credit agreement by  the revolving credit facility was also increased from  to  under the terms of the fourth amendment primarily due to increased stand by letters of credit requirements to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program and to provide additional liquidity 
all other material terms of the credit agreement remain in force  except to the extent they have been modified by the fourth amendment as described in this paragraph 
the credit agreement provides that  at the company s option  the term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
based on the terms of the fourth amendment  the increase in the term loan and the company s performance for the twelve months ended december   the performance based rates would be libor plus for the term loan and libor plus for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
such rate is subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
payment of accrued interest is due and payable quarterly by the company 
payments of principal under the term loan are payable on a quarterly basis  ending on march  the fourth amendment extends the revolving credit facility until july  at december    was outstanding on the term loan 
there were no borrowings against the revolving credit facility leaving  available after reserving  for the outstanding stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is available at the discretion of management 
it is primarily used for funding the seasonal sales programs related to the furnace and evaporative cooler product lines 
as noted  the line is also used to secure stand by letters of credit to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
during the fiscal year  the highest amount of company borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  not including the amount securing stand by letters of credit  was  and the average amount outstanding was  at december   the company was not in compliance with the cash flow ratio as defined in the loan agreement 
the company has obtained waivers of the requirement for the year end and the first quarter of the company expects to be in compliance with the covenant at the end of the second quarter of a principal reason for not meeting the required ratio was the high level of capital expenditures during during fiscal  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement covering the period december  through december  in order to minimize the adverse impact of the floating interest rate characteristic of some of the company s term loan borrowings 
the company s effective interest rate on the portion of the outstanding term loan covered by the swap agreement was during the effect on the operations was to increase net income by approximately  the company believes that its existing cash balance and anticipated cash flow from operations  supplemented by seasonal borrowings against the revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits deductible policy limits product and general liability workers compensation auto and truck liability should the aggregated out of pocket payments for the three policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  an umbrella policy is maintained which covers the next  of claims

results of operations this section discusses consolidated results 
the following sections discuss the results of the reporting segments and contain more detail 
consolidated sales were  in   in and  in the increase in over was realized by all four segments as virtually all products ended the year with higher volumes than achieved in the primary driver of the sales increase was the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment as a result of both volume and price increases 
the increase in over the sales was realized primarily by the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment although the door and evaporative cooling segments also reported gains 
the increased sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment was the result of both volume increases due to construction activity along the front range of colorado as well as price increases in response to higher cement and fuel costs 
the sales volume declined modestly in the heating and cooling segment where warmer than usual weather in california throughout most of the year depressed sales 
although all of the segments experienced a high level of price competition during  some price improvements were introduced in response to higher costs 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization remained relatively constant at for both and the effect of flooding at two of our aggregates operations in july and august of reduced the effect of price increases and operating efficiencies in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
door margins declined due to lower margins in the newly acquired electronic access business 
price competition and some dramatic material cost increases narrowed the margins of the heating and cooling segment while the evaporative cooling segment improved margins primarily due to a shift in product mix to larger industrial units 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization increased as a percentage of sales from for to for the increase in percentage was due to competitive market conditions which prevented sales price increases from fully recovering the material and fuel cost increases 
an increase in workers compensation claims also added to the costs during depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from to due to increased capital expenditures during and amortization of intangible assets associated with the asci and cssl acquitions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization had declined from to reflecting the effect of reduced capital spending in the prior three years 
selling and administrative costs increased both in dollars and as a percentage of sales  although the latter only modestly from in to in while much of the increase was due to the increased sales volume  a substantial increase in the heating and cooling segment as well as additional costs of approximately  associated with the redefinition of our segments and related late filing of the form k also drove these costs higher 
selling and administrative costs at the corporate office declined largely due to lower incentive based compensation 
selling and administrative costs increased during as compared to primarily due to the increased sales volume 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined modestly as compared to the administrative costs at the corporate office increased largely due to compensation 
selling and administrative costs within the segments varied and are discussed below 
the gain on disposition of property and equipment decreased during compared to current year sales primarily related to the disposition of equipment that was replaced during the year 
the amount includes gains of  on the sales of property in colorado springs and pueblo while the gain includes  generated by sales of two parcels of real estate in colorado 
operating income declined from  in to  in despite the increase in sales largely due to the margin decline and increased selling and administrative costs in the heating and cooling segment 
the expenses related to the flooding at two of our aggregate operations as well as the decrease in gains on the sale of property and equipment also reduced operating income in operating income increased from  for to  for primarily as a result of the increased sales volume  the decrease in depreciation expense and the increased gain on the sale of property and equipment 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material and fuel costs 
net interest expense increased over the prior year in both and due to increased borrowings as well as higher average interest rates during both years 
the company s effective income tax rates reflect federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the effective rate for was increased by for adjustments made to state taxes and reduced by for the benefit realized from percentage depletion 
the effective rate for was reduced by for adjustments made to the accrual for tax contingencies as a result of the closure of tax years subject to audits by taxing authorities 
the effective rate was also reduced by for percentage depletion 
the effective rate for was reduced by for adjustments made to the accrual for tax contingencies 
the rate was also reduced by for state tax credits and for percentage depletion 
the company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies 
based on these reviews and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
reserves for these tax matters are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note as discussed above  the company operates primarily in two industry groups both of which are somewhat seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products industry group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies doors revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment improved to  in  an increase of  or over the amount of  the improvement was primarily due to three large commercial jobs in the pueblo area  the relatively strong construction market during the first half of coupled with favorable weather conditions during the first quarter of the year as compared to the quarter and concrete price increases 
although the housing market slowed midyear  continued work on the three large industrial jobs allowed us to increase sales volume for despite volume declines in denver and colorado springs for the year 
the purchase of asci on june  also helped offset some of the effect of the slowing market in colorado springs 
concrete pricing improved during althought the increases were largely instituted to offset increased cement and fuel cost 
aggregates sales improved in combination with the concrete volume 
sales of the supplies division declined in a slower  more price competitive market 
sales for in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment increased  or over the amount of  concrete volume increased in colorado springs and denver while pueblo saw a small decline 
volumes improved primarily as a result of increased construction activity along the front range of colorado 
pricing improved at all locations largely in response to the higher cost of cement and fuel 
the denver operations also experienced an increase in their cost of aggregates 
although prices in the denver ready mix concrete market rose for the first time in three years  conditions remain very competitive 
management estimates that the market wide cement shortage during the months of september and october resulted in lost concrete volume of to for the year 
aggregates sales improved as demand for concrete rose 
sales of construction supplies mirrored the increases experienced by the other products 
operating income is highly sensitive to sales volume in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
this segment has also historically required a sizable investment in capital assets resulting in a large portion of its costs being relatively fixed in nature 
operating income as a percent of sales  therefore  generally increases and decreases at a higher rate but in tandem with sales changes 
operating income was  for and increased at a greater rate than sales as compared to the results of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales declined from in to in the improvement is the result of some price increases in excess of the higher cement and fuel costs  delivery cost efficiencies on the large industrial jobs  lower workers compensation claims  and the relatively fixed nature of some costs that rose at a lower rate than the sales increases 
selling and administrative costs increased but declined as a percentage of sales due to the fixed nature of some of the costs 
partially offsetting these improvements were the  decrease in the gain on dispositions of property and equipment from the level in this segment and the effect of flooding at our two arkansas river operations in july and a second flood at our pueblo east pit in late august 
both were the result of heavy rains in the area 
all expenses incurred to repair the damage and resume production have been recognized in cost of sales 
both quarries are back in operation although some measures to mitigate future vulnerability have not yet been finalized 
management estimates that the effect of the flooding added over  in expenses at the two gravel operations 
the company has filed insurance claims 
the claims  which are subject to policy deductibles  are currently being reviewed by the insurance companies 
no recovery has been anticipated or recorded in the results of operations 
operating income was  during and increased at a greater rate than sales as compared to the results of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales  however  increased from during to for the increased percentage was the result of a highly competitive market 
a higher level of workers compensation claims also increased costs at our colorado springs operations during the effect of the increased cost of sales dampened the effect of increased sales on operating profit 
there were several other factors that increased operating income during selling and administrative costs increased at a lesser rate than the improved sales primarily due to office staff reductions in denver 
depreciation  depletion and amortization declined reflecting the effect of reduced capital spending in recent years 
finally  the gain on disposition of property and equipment increased from the level primarily due to the transactions noted above in the discussion of consolidated results 
operating income as a percent of sales improved as a result of these factors 
the return on assets for increased as a result of the higher sales and improved profit margins partially offset by the investment related to the asci acquisition and a higher level of receivables 
the return on assets in as compared to the return for was enhanced by the  decrease in assets that related to this segment s portion of the receivable for insured losses 
this asset  which we are required to record by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts  is offset by an equal liability for unpaid claims covered by insurance 
a change in this asset between years distorts the return on assets percentage 
door segment sales in the door segment for increased  or over primarily due to the acquisition of cssl at the beginning of the year 
sales in the door segment for were  an increase of  or over the amount of  the increase was the result of a slightly stronger market and  to some extent  higher sales prices resulting from increased costs 
operating income was  during compared to  during despite the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of cssl 
narrower margins in the electronic access business and expenses associated with the assimilation of the businesses contributed to the decline 
operating income was  during compared to  for the improvement was the result of the increased sales 
operating income as a percentage of sales for returned to the level due to the narrower margins in the newly acquired cssl electronic access business noted above 
the higher percentage of operating income to sales achieved during was due to the higher operating income resulting from the increase in sales 
similarly  the return on assets for also declined from the level although it remained above the return 
the decline in as compared to was the result of both the decreased operating income in combined with an increase in the segment assets  primarily receivables and inventories which are higher due to the increase in sales 
the return on assets for was much higher than during due to the higher operating income while the segment assets declined slightly 
the increase in sales for as compared to did not result in a higher receivable balance at year end as the increase was achieved more ratably over the year while the increased sales in came more heavily at the year end 
hvac industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac industry group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment sales in the heating and cooling segment increased to  an increase of  or  from the amount of  sales of both furnaces and fan coils rose during the year 
furnace volume increased due to the recapture of all of the business of a large national home center account 
the fan coil sales increase is attributable to the company s restructuring of its sales representative network and the addition of internal sales and support staff 
sales for declined  or from the amount of  a decline in furnace sales was partially offset by an increase in fan coil sales 
the decline in furnace sales was largely due to the loss of business to a large national home center account in one geographic location and warmer than usual weather in california throughout most of the year 
fan coil sales improved in a still weak market as the result of more competitive pricing 
operating income declined from  for to  during the decline is the result of numerous factors  all reducing income 
pricing decisions made to retain and expand our furnace business with a national home center account reduced our selling price and the related margin 
a substantial price increase in copper prices coupled with increases in aluminum and steel narrowed margins for both product lines although the primary effect was on the fan coil line due to its considerable copper content 
furnace prices are established at the beginning of the season 
fan coil pricing is generally determined and fixed at the time the contract is awarded 
the period of time from the awarding of a contract and the production and delivery of the product can vary 
during this intervening period in  we experienced significant increases in copper prices which were the principal contributor to the lower fan coil margins 
the company has not used financial instruments to hedge copper or other commodity prices 
the addition of sales  engineering and support staff and the opening of a sales and service center in oklahoma city made to increase fan coil sales increased selling and administrative expenses 
expenditures for computer system upgrades and product configuration software and the cost of general business consultants engaged to review all aspects of the business and organization also increased selling and administrative costs 
finally  our earthquake insurance premiums increased by approximately  operating income declined from  for to  for partially due to the decrease in sales 
cost of sales  as a percent of sales  decreased from to 
margins improved as current year selling prices were adjusted to recover most of the increase in steel costs incurred during  however this recovery was partially offset by pricing decisions made from time to time in response to competition 
selling and administrative expenses increased during as a result of costs related to the replacement of the general manager at williams furnace co  including severance pay  and the addition of personnel in the sales and engineering departments 
operating income as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both much lower in compared to due to the lower operating income 
the factors that resulted in the reduced operating income are discussed above 
operating income as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both lower in compared to as a result of the lower operating income as discussed above 
the decline in the return on assets was slightly higher as an increase in receivables and inventories raised the year end assets level at the same time that operating income declined 
evaporative cooling segment sales in the evaporative cooling segment improved to  an increase of  or  over the amount of  unit volume increased notably for the larger industrial applications 
sales for increased  or over the amount of  sales of evaporative coolers increased as a result of the partial recapture of the window unit business at a large national home center account and favorable weather that extended into august 
operating results improved from the loss of  for to a profit of  in the overall increased sales volume combined with the shift to the larger industrial units improved the margins 
reduced workers compensation claims also aided the return to profitability 
operating results for declined from  for to a loss of  for despite the increase in sales 
cost of sales  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the increased percentage was due to pricing decisions made in response to pricing introduced by our largest competitor 
higher workers compensation claims and lower production volume also contributed to the higher cost ratio 
operating results as a percent of sales are still very low due to the modest amount of operating income but it has returned to a level approaching s level after the loss incurred during the return on assets slightly exceeded the level due to the decrease in segment assets  the result of lower inventory levels and the reduced net book value of property  plant and equipment 
operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets for are not meaningful due to the operating loss incurred during the year 
the factors that resulted in the loss are discussed above 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized as a charge to earnings 
the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant company subsidiaries or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be immediately recognized 
this assessment requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates and costs 
in addition  the terms of recent industry transactions mergers are considered 
no impairment was indicated in the current year 
if the assessment had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired  an impairment charge would have been recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances could materially affect the estimated fair value 
liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
provision for workers compensation claims is estimated with the assistance of an independent expert who applies actuarial methodology to information provided by the company s independent claims administrator 
provision for automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are recorded in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and are reviewed at least annually for revisions in estimates 
the company records a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim the disturbed areas 
actual reclamation costs are charged against the reserve 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
the assessment may be done more frequently if events or circumstances arise that may indicate a change in estimated costs  recoverable material or the period of mining activity 
the company periodically engages an independent professional to assist in reevaluating the estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation 
this analysis requires the independent professional and us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the mining plans  homogeneity of the deposits  third party costs to perform work  method of reclamation to be used  etc 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the reserve are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances  including legislative requirements  could materially affect estimated costs  the quantitites of recoverable material or the period of mining 
depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 
sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
sales are recorded net of estimates of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances based upon current program terms and historical experience 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience 
recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued the following statements and interpretations in september  the fasb issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to provide interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year beginning after november  adoption of sab in fiscal is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of fsas no 
in february  the fasb issued a related statement  sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items such as investments  debt and derivative instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet begun evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
could have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we plan to adopt fin effective for the first quarter of the fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated results of operations and are not yet in a position to determine such effects 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
adoption of sfas no 
during did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
furthermore  future consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition will only be impacted by sfas if the company implements a voluntary change in accounting principle or identifies and corrects accounting errors in future periods 
in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  accounting for stripping costs in the mining industry eitf which is effective on january  eitf states that stripping costs incurred after the first saleable minerals are extracted from the mine ie post production stripping costs should be considered costs of the extracted minerals and recognized as a component of inventory to be recognized in costs of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory 
the company has historically treated post production stripping costs in the manner proscribed by eitf  therefore  adoption of eitf during fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment was issued and replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires using a fair value based model for the measurement of all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options 
deferred compensation calculated under the fair value method would then be amortized into income over the respective vesting period of the stock option 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  there are no stock options outstanding as of december  therefore the adoption of sfas r did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no
