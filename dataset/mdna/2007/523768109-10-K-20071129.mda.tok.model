non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  the company believes the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate its financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
the company also believes such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business or its ability to meet debt service requirements 
operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow  which is defined as operating income before depreciation  amortization  and equity in earnings of associated companies  and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow divided by operating revenue are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
the company believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information because of their focus on results from operations before depreciation and amortization and earnings from equity investments 
reconciliations of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income and operating income margin  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are included in the table below thousands percent of revenue percent of revenue percent of revenue operating cash flow less depreciation and amortization equity in earnings of associated companies operating income adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per common share adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per common share  which are defined as income from continuing operations and earnings per common share adjusted to exclude matters of a substantially non recurring nature  are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
the company believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information by identifying expenses and expense reductions that are not indicative of core business operating results and are of a substantially non recurring nature 
reconciliations of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per common share to income from continuing operations and earnings per common share  respectively  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are set forth below under the caption overall results 
same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures consummated in the current or prior year 
the company believes such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in its revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
the company owns of tni and also owns of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of the company s accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  the company makes a determination of the fair value of its business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
the company analyzes goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  for a more detailed explanation of the company s intangible assets 
the company also periodically evaluates its determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact the cash flows of the company 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans the company evaluates its liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors 
if the company used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company files income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered the alternative interpretations 
table of contents that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believes its positions taken regarding its filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
the company does not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to its consolidated financial position or cash flows 
revenue recognition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related online site 
circulation revenue is recorded as newspapers are distributed over the subscription term 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for publications or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks the company is self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of its employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
the company accrues its estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
the company s reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in  the fasb issued statement  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which amends statements   and r 
statement requires the recognition of the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and recognition of changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of comprehensive income 
the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement as of september  the adoption of statement increased accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income taxes  by  increased pension assets by  and reduced pension and postretirement benefit obligations by  and  respectively 
statement will also require the company to change its measurement date to the last day of the fiscal year from a date three months prior to the end of the fiscal year  beginning in the change in measurement date will require a one time adjustment to retained earnings  the effect of which cannot be determined at this time 
none of the changes required will impact the company s results of operations or cash flows 
in  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is effective for the company in interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the company will adopt interpretation effective in october  with any cumulative effect of the adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the company has not completed its evaluation of the effects of interpretation on its consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  provides guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements 
statement does not require any new fair value measurement but applies to the accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement 
statement is effective for the company in the company does not 
table of contents anticipate that the implementation of statement will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
subsequently  the fasb deferred the effective date of this pronouncement until for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements 
in  the fasb issued statement  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides the company the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required or permitted to be measured at fair value 
statement is effective for the company in the company has not completed its evaluation on the effect of statement on its consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates restricted cash and investments interest rate risk in the company s restricted cash and investments is managed by investing only in securities with maturities no later than may  after which time all restrictions on such funds lapse 
only us government and related securities are permitted 
debt the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to the london interbank offered rate libor 
a basis point increase to libor would decrease income from continuing operations before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september   after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  and excluding debt of mni 
such interest rates may also decrease 
in  the company executed interest rate swaps in the notional amount of  with a forward starting date of november  the interest rate swaps have terms of to years  carry interest rates from to plus the applicable libor margin and effectively fix the company s interest rate on debt in the amounts  and for the time periods  of such instruments 
in november  interest rate swaps in the notional amount of  expire 
in october  the company executed interest rate collars in the notional amount of  with a forward starting date of november  the collars have a two year term and limit libor to an average floor of and a cap of 
such collars effectively limit the range of the company s exposure to interest rates to libor greater than the floor and less than the cap in either case plus the applicable libor margin for the time period of such instruments 
certain of the company s interest earning assets  including those in employee benefit plans  also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt 
at september   after consideration of the interest rate swaps described above  approximately of the principal amount of the company s debt is subject to floating interest rates 
commodities certain materials used by the company are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
the company is also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
newsprint prices  which had been declining since september  have been stable since june in july  several major newsprint manufacturers announced a price increase of per metric ton on newsprint  effective for deliveries in november in november  several major newsprint manufacturers announced an additional 
table of contents price increase of per metric ton on newsprint 
the increase  as announced  is expected to be staged in equal amounts over three months commencing with deliveries in january the final extent of changes in price  if any  is subject to negotiation between such manufacturers and the company 
a per metric ton newsprint price increase would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of mni and tni 
such prices may also decrease 
in october  abitibi consolidated inc and bowater inc 
announced consummation of a merger of the two companies 
the merger significantly increases the market share of the combined company from that of the individual companies and is expected to create substantial operating efficiencies 
the company acquired newsprint and specialty paper products from both abitibi consolidated inc and bowater inc at the present time  the impact on pricing of products sold to the company as a result of the merger cannot be determined 
sensitivity to changes in value the estimate that follows is intended to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt of the company in one year from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the calculation is not intended to represent the actual loss in fair value that the company expects to incur 
the estimate does not consider favorable changes in market rates 
the position included in the calculation is fixed rate debt  the principal amount of which totals  at september  the estimated maximum potential one year loss in fair value from a basis point movement in interest rates on market risk sensitive investment instruments outstanding at september   is approximately  there is no impact on reported results from such changes in interest rates 
changes in the value of interest rate swaps and collars from movements in interest rates are not determinable  due to the number of variables involved in the pricing of such instruments 
however  increases in interest rates would generally result in increases in the fair value of such instruments
