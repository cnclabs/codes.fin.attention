item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations and financial condition overview we are a global market leader in design  development  manufacturing  sale and support of commercial jetliners  military aircraft  satellites  missile defense  human space flight and launch systems and services 
we are one of the two major manufacturers of seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the us while our principal operations are in the us  we rely extensively on a network of partners  key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world 
our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses commercial airplanes and integrated defense systems ids supplemented and supported by boeing capital corporation bcc 
taken together  these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace 
we focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality 
ids is a defense systems business that integrates its resources in defense  intelligence  communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs 
our strategy is to leverage our core businesses with a simultaneously intense focus on growth and productivity 
our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality 
bcc delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financial exposures 
in  our revenues grew by percent 
earnings from operations increased 
we continued to invest in key growth programs as research and development expense grew by to billion  reflecting increased spending on the and programs and lower cost sharing payments from suppliers 
we generated operating cash flow of billion driven by operating and working capital performance 
we reduced debt by billion and repurchased million common shares 
our contractual backlog grew to billion  driven by growth at commercial airplanes while our total backlog grew to billion 
at the end of  we implemented new accounting rules for pensions and other post retirement benefits  which together with the annual remeasurement of our pension plans reduced our shareholders equity by billion 
this decrease did not affect cash flows or the funded status of our benefit plans 
we expect continued growth in commercial airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand by ramping up commercial aircraft production 
we expect ids revenue to be slightly lower in and anticipate that the us department of defense us dod budget growth will moderate over the next several years 
we are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer focused growth 
consolidated results of operations revenues dollars in millions year ended december  commercial airplanes integrated defense systems boeing capital corporation other accounting differences eliminations total revenues 
table of contents higher consolidated revenues in were primarily due to higher new commercial aircraft deliveries 
ids revenues were up moderately in as growth in precision engagement and mobility systems and support systems was partially offset by lower volume in network and space systems 
bcc revenues increased in primarily due to higher investment income and higher net gain on disposal of assets 
other segment revenues decreased in as a result of the buyout of several operating lease aircraft in the amount of million in in addition  revenues decreased in accounting differences eliminations due to higher commercial airplanes intercompany deliveries in consolidated revenues also increased in as compared to the increase was due to the growth at commercial airplanes driven by higher new aircraft deliveries  increased spares and aircraft modifications  and higher used aircraft sales 
ids revenues remained stable in after strong growth in bcc revenues for were essentially unchanged from earnings from operations the following table summarizes our earnings from operations dollars in millions year ended december  commercial airplanes integrated defense systems boeing capital corporation other unallocated expense global settlement with us department of justice earnings from operations our earnings from operations increased in compared to primarily driven by improved earnings at commercial airplanes and lower unallocated expense 
this was partially offset by a million charge for global settlement with us department of justice see note  lower ids earnings reflecting a million net gain on the sale of our rocketdyne business in and million of charges on the airborne early warning control aew c development program in partially offset by improved margins on other programs and a million charge related to the exit of the connexion by boeing business recorded in other segment see note 
an increase in earnings from operations in compared to was primarily due to strong operating performance by our business segments partially offset by higher unallocated expense 
included in results is a charge of million related to the united states air force usaf tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the aircraft 
the most significant items included in unallocated expense are shown in the following table dollars in millions year ended december  pension and post retirement expense share based plans expense deferred compensation expense other unallocated expense we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions of  million in   million in  and million in not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the 
table of contents end of the reporting period 
accordingly  earnings from operations included million   million and million of pension expense in   and  respectively 
a portion of pension expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension expense 
unallocated pension and other post retirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
net periodic benefit cost related to pensions decreased in compared to mainly due to an absence of net settlement and curtailment charges partially offset by an increase in the amount of actuarial loss that was amortized 
the increase in and deferred compensation plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price 
higher pension and post retirement amounts in compared to are primarily related to higher amortization of actuarial losses and net settlement and curtailment charges due to divestitures 
the increase in share based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock 
other earnings items dollars in millions year ended december  earnings from operations other income  net interest and debt expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations other income primarily consists of interest income 
interest income was higher in and as a result of higher interest rates and higher cash and investment balances partially offset by lower interest income related to federal income tax settlements for prior years 
interest and debt expense decreased in and due to debt repayments 
the effective income tax rate of for differed from the effective income tax rate of primarily due to the favorable settlement with the internal revenue service and the non deduction in of the global settlement with the us department of justice 
the effective income tax rate of for was comparable to the effective income tax rate of 
both and benefited from audit settlements and export tax benefits 
is the final year for recognizing export tax benefits 
for additional discussion related to income taxes see note backlog contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options  announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed  and unobligated us and us government contract funding 
contractual backlog increased by  million in compared to as a result of increases at commercial airplanes of  million  which were primarily due to new orders in excess of deliveries for the ng  and airplanes  and increases at ids of  million which were driven by funding received from new orders and existing contracts for c  f a  integrated logistics chinook support  and proprietary 

table of contents unobligated backlog includes us and us government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized 
funding that is subsequently received is moved to contractual backlog

segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment air travel growth is driven by a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
air traffic growth continues to exceed its long term trend due to strong performance of these key drivers 
global economic growth  the primary driver of air traffic growth  remained above long term trend for the third straight year in evidence of increasing liberalization can be seen in the declining restrictions on flights between countries  increasing private ownership of airlines and reduced regulation of competition within markets 
looking forward  our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger traffic  and per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increasing utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the airline industry is becoming increasingly competitive resulting in airlines focusing on increasing productivity and improving service levels 
airlines are changing many aspects of their operations including simplifying fleets  distribution  and pricing  outsourcing non essential operations  reducing labor costs and airport costs  increasing asset utilization  and developing new business models through innovations in network structure  fare structures  service levels and distribution networks 
such changes are providing new opportunities for airline industry suppliers 
worldwide  many airlines continue reporting operating profits although performance varies significantly by region and business model 
recent industry financials generally show increasing unit revenues and rising fares 
cost cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are helping many airlines remain profitable despite intense competition and high fuel prices 
fuel costs now comprise one quarter of airline operating costs compared to less than three years ago 
overall  the industry is forecast to lose half a billion dollars in  but return to profitability in many airlines that are growing to meet increased demand are acquiring new capacity from manufacturers 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks such as avian flu  the threat of terrorism  global economic imbalances  increasing global environmental concerns and fuel prices 
fuel prices are forecast to remain elevated and volatile in the near term due to strong demand driven by economic growth and minimal surplus capacity to cushion against supply shocks 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
we expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide measured in real terms to continue into the foreseeable future 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 

table of contents continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately two thirds of commercial airplanes sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the united states 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
a decline of the us dollar relative to their local currencies puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits 
competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus has recently announced such initiatives targeting a two year reduction in its development cycle and a increase in overall productivity by if the us dollar strengthens  airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins

backlog the backlog increase in related to orders in excess of deliveries for ng  and  while the increase in related to orders in excess of deliveries for ng  and accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
it is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 
commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which do not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates  thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 

table of contents the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 
the table below provides details as of december program ng program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a n a program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a n a program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a the accounting quantity for the program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery  targeted for firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired 
typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its board of directors  shareholders  government and completing financing arrangements 
all such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain 
firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights 
cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
next generation the accounting quantity for the next generation program increased by units during due to the program s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
program in november  we launched the family  which includes the intercontinental passenger airplane and the freighter 
this launch and additional firm orders have extended the life of this program and have also solidified product strategy 
the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during during we completed firm configuration of the freighter and the same is expected for the passenger version in deliveries of the first freighter and intercontinental passenger airplane are targeted for late and late program during and the program obtained additional orders  including firm orders during in addition  on february   a customer announced its plans to order extended range freighters 
we continue pursuing market opportunities for additional sales 

table of contents program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during as a result of the program s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
program as we progress toward first flight and entry into service of the  we continue to manage pressures with respect to weight  schedule  and supplier implementation as they arise 
there are inherent risks associated with the development and production of any new airplane  which can impact expectations 
but we still continue to expect delivery of the on schedule and in accordance with our contractual obligations 
we are preparing for the first test flight of the in  and for entry into service in a key milestone of the program was achieved in with the initial flight of the first large cargo freighter lcf  called the dreamlifter 
these specially modified freighters will transport major composite structures of the airplanes 
other key events during were the first shipment of a major assembly between supplier partners and the introduction of a digital computer simulation of the entire production and assembly process 
completed programs program on january   we announced our decision to complete production of the aircraft during due to the lack of overall market demand 
the final was delivered in the second quarter of program production of the program ended in october the last aircraft was delivered in the second quarter of for additional information regarding termination liabilities remaining in accounts payable and other liabilities for these two programs see note deferred production costs deferred production costs represent commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units using program accounting 
as of december  and deferred production costs relate to the program and there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders 
the deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the program s inventory at december are summarized in the following table dollars in millions deferred production costs unamortized tooling as of december  and  the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs balance to go cost estimates 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
this level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years 
these costs do not vary significantly with current production rates 

table of contents research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs 
logo our research and development expense increased  million and million in and research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers 
the increase in was due to higher spending of million  primarily on and  and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments 
the increase during was primarily due to increased spending on the program and was partially offset by supplier development cost sharing payments 
during the second and third quarters of  we increased our research and development expense forecasts for and to reflect increasing pressures on the program as well as modified and increased scope on the program to support customer expectations 
we are also continuing to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the and programs 
integrated defense systems business environment and trends ids consists of three capabilities driven businesses precision engagement and mobility systems pe ms  network and space systems n ss  and support systems 
defense environment overview the us is faced with continuous force deployments overseas  stability operations in afghanistan and iraq  and the requirement both to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the quadrennial defense review report qdr 
all of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant federal budget deficits and an administration pledge to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending 
we anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade 
because us dod spending makes up about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately of ids revenue in  the trends and drivers associated with the us dod budget are critical 
the us dod budget has grown substantially over the past decade  particularly after the terrorist attacks of september  although the growth rate had moderated in recent years  the submittal equates to an increase over the projected enacted level 
the president s request for fiscal year is billion  excluding the additional billion request to continue the fight in the global war on terror gwot in fiscal year in the past emergency supplementals had been used to cover the on going costs of the gwot 
in addition to the fiscal year budget request the president also submitted a fiscal year emergency supplemental requesting billion to cover operations in the gwot for the remainder of fiscal year this supplemental is in addition to the billion previously provided by congress 
the procurement account continues to see growth with a request of billion  a increase over  while the 
table of contents research  development  test evaluation rdt e account remains flat at billion 
all projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account and without accounting for supplemental funding 
even though we continue to see some growth in the us dod budget  it is unlikely that the us dod will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the qdr 
this imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the us dod and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules  restructuring programs  and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding 
we expect the us dod will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness  network centric operations  persistent intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  long range strike  special operations  unmanned systems  precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons  and continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
consolidation of contractor provided us government launch capabilities was completed with the formation of the united launch alliance llc ula joint venture in this consolidation was driven by the limited schedule of government launches as well as the downturn in the commercial launch market 
launch contractors had built business cases around the government market being supplemented by a robust commercial market  but as the commercial market declined these business cases were re evaluated 
the us government has an assured access to space policy which requires that two separate vehicles be available for use 
the ula joint venture is intended to provide this assurance 
civil space transportation and exploration environment nasa has had stable but very little growth in their funding in this decade 
nasa s fiscal year appropriation of billion was approximately equal to the fiscal year funding level  and presently the agency is operating under a continuing resolution in nasa s budget remains focused on needed funds for space shuttle operations  international space station  and new initiatives associated with the vision for space exploration 
we anticipate funding levels to remain in the billion range in the near future 
nasa is continuing to pursue elements of the vision for space exploration  which will provide additional opportunities 
commercial satellite environment the commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade 
the market remains extremely competitive however  with overcapacity across the overall industry and strong pressure on pricing 
we will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions 
integrated defense systems operating results dollars in millions revenues of total company revenues operating earnings operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog 
table of contents since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term award 
as a result  period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
revenues ids revenues increased in and in as growth in both pe ms and support systems was partially offset by lower volume in n ss 
operating earnings ids operating earnings decreased by million in from reflecting a million net gain on the sale of rocketdyne in and million of charges on the aew c development program in partially offset by improved margins on other programs 
operating earnings increased by million in from primarily due to the net gain on the rocketdyne sale in in addition to stable performance in the commercial satellite business compared to  when losses were recorded resulting from cost growth due to technical and quality issues and write downs of slow moving inventory 
backlog total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding  and unobligated backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated 
ids total backlog decreased in  from  million to  million  primarily due to decreases in unobligated backlog of  million which resulted from funding released from new orders and existing contracts on f a  fcs  c  and proprietary  offset by increases in contractual backlog of  million which were driven by funding received from new orders and existing contracts for c  f a  integrated logistics chinook support  and proprietary 
for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished 
examples of these programs include ground based midcourse defense gmd  fcs  p a p a  formerly multi mission maritime aircraft  proprietary programs  airborne laser  joint tactical radio system jtrs  family of beyond line of sight terminals  and the e a g 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed  which could trigger termination for default provisions  the loss of satellite on orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues 
examples of these programs include aew c  tanker  commercial and military satellites  vigilare and high frequency modernisation

research and development the pe ms segment continues to focus its research and development resources where it can use its customer knowledge  technical strength and large scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions to meet the war fighter s enduring needs 
research and development has remained consistent over the past several years 
research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of situational awareness and survivability 
these efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability  and improving affordability  reliability and economic ownership 
continued research and development investments in unmanned technology and systems have enabled the demonstration of multi vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles 
research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes  among other things  precision guidance and multi mode targeting 
research and development investments in the global tanker transport aircraft program represent a significant 
table of contents opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and non us customers 
investments were also made to support various intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance business opportunities including p a and aew c aircraft 
other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the f a e f super hornet  f e eagle  ah apache  ch chinook and c globemaster iii

additional considerations items which could have a future impact on pe ms operations include the following aew c during we recorded charges of million on our international airborne early warning and control program 
this development program  also known as wedgetail in australia and peace eagle in turkey  consists of a aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems  some of which have never been installed on an airplane before 
wedgetail includes six aircraft and peace eagle includes four aircraft 
this is an advanced and complex fixed price development program involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability 
the second quarter charge of million included estimated additional program costs and reductions in expected pricing caused by technical complexities which resulted in schedule delays and cost growth and increased the risk of late delivery penalties 
the financial impact recorded in that quarter resulted from a detailed analysis of flight test data along with a series of additional rigorous technical and cost reviews after flight testing ramped up 
the hardware and software development and integration had not progressed as quickly as we planned  resulting in the delivery for the first two aircraft being delayed months 
we reorganized the program to improve systems engineering and integration and we strengthened the leadership team in both program management and engineering 
in the fourth quarter of  after a revised estimate of technical progress by us and our subcontractors  we determined that program subsystems and software development had not matured as we had anticipated earlier in the year 
we recorded a charge of an additional million  reflecting further program delays of up to six months 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the most recent cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed 
c as of december   we have delivered a total of of the c s ordered by the us air force  with final deliveries scheduled for despite pending orders  which would extend deliveries of the c to mid  it is reasonably possible that we will decide in to suspend work on long lead items from suppliers and or to complete production of the c if further orders are not received 
we are still evaluating the full financial impact of a production shut down  including any recovery that would be available from the government 
tanker program the tanker program has orders for eight tankers  four from the italian air force and four from the japan self defense agency 
the usaf is continuing to pursue a replacement for the kc tanker and has identified it as its top acquisition priority for in addition  the pentagon requested funding for the development phase of the program in its budget request in february we remain firmly committed to the usaf tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nation s current aerial refueling fleet

we and lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the us government 
we agreed to indemnify ula through december  against potential non recoverability of  million of boeing delta inventories included in contributed assets plus  million of inventory subject to the inventory supply agreement 
in addition  in the event ula is unable to obtain re pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ula and to which we believe ula is entitled  we will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to million in pre tax losses 
ula is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
n ss revenues include million related to delta rockets and formation of ula will reduce n ss revenues in we do not expect ula to have a material impact to our earnings  cash flows  or financial position for sea launch the sea launch venture  in which we are a partner  provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers 
for the year ended december   the venture conducted five successful launches 
we have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the sea launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing 
in the event we are required to perform on these guarantees  we believe we can recover a portion of the cost estimated at million through guarantees from the other venture partners 
the components of this exposure are as follows dollars in millions estimated maximum exposure established reserves estimated proceeds from recourse estimated net exposure credit guarantees partner loans principal and interest advances to provide for future launches trade receivable from sea launch performance guarantees other receivables from sea launch we made no additional capital contributions to the sea launch venture during the year ended december  we suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to sea launch down to zero in and accruing our obligation for third party guarantees on sea launch indebtedness 
we

boeing capital corporation segment business environment and trends bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled  million  which was substantially collateralized by our commercial aircraft 
while worldwide traffic levels are well above those in the past  the effects of higher fuel prices continue to impact the airline industry 
at the same time  the credit ratings of some airlines  particularly in the united states  have remained at low levels 
despite positive factors including passenger load at record high levels  a limited supply of economically viable used aircraft and  increasing lease rates  values as measured by reference to published reports from multiple external appraisers for the various aircraft types that are collateral in bcc s portfolio generally have not increased 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service 
approximately  commercial jet aircraft of current world fleet continue to be parked  including both in production and out of production aircraft types of which over are not expected to return to service 
aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft  particularly types with relatively few operators  are placed out of service 
at december    million and  million of bcc s portfolio was collateralized by and aircraft 
during  bcc recognized an expense of million to increase the valuation allowance resulting from a decrease in the collateral value of the aircraft 
see note summary financial information dollars in millions revenues operating earnings operating margins revenues bcc segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes  and lease income from equipment under operating lease 
bcc s revenues increased million in  primarily due to an increase in investment income of million from the sale or repayment at maturity of certain investments and a higher gain on the sale of aircraft and certain investments in notes receivable of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in interest and lease income due to decreases in the weighted average balance of the related portfolio 
bcc s revenues were essentially unchanged in compared with operating earnings bcc s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense  provision for losses  asset impairment expense  depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses 
operating earnings increased by million in primarily due to increased revenues 
the increase in operating earnings in compared with was primarily due to a lower asset impairment expense and the absence of debt redemption costs partially offset by increased depreciation expense

  and r sfas no 
 which required recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  with a corresponding after tax adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the adoption of sfas  together with the annual remeasurement of our pension plans  resulted in a net  million decrease in shareholders equity 
this decrease does not affect cash flows or the funded status of our benefit plans

estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust 

table of contents purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
in addition  the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position include agreements for production goods  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a country outside the us or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities

based on historical experience  it is not anticipated that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers see note 
industrial revenue bonds we utilize industrial revenue bonds irb issued by the city of wichita  kansas and fulton county  georgia to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property see note 
critical accounting policies and standards issued and not yet implemented contract accounting contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
the federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
the development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
estimates of each significant contract s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the 
table of contents underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in ids for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately million 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured parts  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling costs  and routine warranty costs 
underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for by approximately million 
aircraft valuation used aircraft under trade in commitments the fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as  model  age and condition  market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models  and multiple valuation sources 
trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft 
this process begins years before the return of the aircraft 
on a quarterly basis  we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market 

table of contents based on the best market information available at the time  it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade in commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling million and million at december  and accounts payable and other liabilities included million at december   which represents the exposure related to these trade in commitments 
had the estimate of trade in value used to calculate our obligation related to probable trade in commitments been lower than our actual assessment  using a measurement date of december   accounts payable and other liabilities would have increased by approximately million 
we continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments 
impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re lease when events or circumstances indicate  we evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re lease for impairment utilizing an expected undiscounted cash flow analysis 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention to hold or dispose of an asset before the end of its economic useful life  the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the aircraft or equipment  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
had future lease rates on these assets we evaluate for impairment been lower  we estimate that no additional impairment expense would have been recognized as of december  we are unable to predict the likelihood of any future impairments 
used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplanes segment are included in inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets 
to mitigate costs and enhance marketability  aircraft may be placed on operating lease 
while on operating lease  the assets are included in customer financing  however  the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market 
allowance for losses on receivables the allowance for losses on receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of reasonably possible and probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit reviews 
factors considered in assessing collectibility include  but are not limited to  a customer s extended delinquency  requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables 
had the applicable cumulative default rate been changed by plus or minus  excluding impaired customers for which the default rate is maintained at  we estimate that the allowance would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
lease residual values equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the lease term or projected economic life of the asset 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases 
for example  a change in the estimated residual values of as of december  could result in a cumulative pre tax earnings impact of million to be recognized over time 

table of contents goodwill impairment goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded 
at the date of our previous impairment test  a increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements 
postretirement plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees 
we also have postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements require several assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense 
in addition  as result of our adoption of sfas  changes in assumptions could significantly increase or decrease shareholders equity net of taxes at future measurement dates 
we use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our september annual measurement date 
changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders equity as of the measurement date 
in future reporting periods  the adjustment for a change in the discount rate will be recognized in other comprehensive loss in the period in which it occurs 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate 
as of september  in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans dollars dollars projected benefit obligation pensions net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
table of contents pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased pension income by approximately million 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected in shareholders equity net of taxes as of our annual measurement date 
in future reporting periods  the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return will be recognized in other comprehensive loss in the period in which it occurs 
the assumed medical trend rates have a significant affect on the following year s expense recorded liabilities and shareholders equity 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change 
as of september  in millions change in medical trend rate increase bps change in medical trend rate decrease bps other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost standards issued and not yet implemented see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
contingent items various legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against us 
most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance 
major contingencies are discussed in note  including our contesting the default termination of the a aircraft  employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees  and litigation arbitration involving bssi 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally investments  fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes 
additionally  boeing capital corporation bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the principal source of bcc s market risk relates to interest rate changes 
this risk is managed by matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with the profile of assets 
any exposure to mismatch risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives 
we do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
although many of the assets  liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded  if we had an immediate  one time  basis point increase in market rates at december   we estimated that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by million compared to a decrease of million at december  
table of contents based on the portfolio of other boeing existing debt  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
the investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
