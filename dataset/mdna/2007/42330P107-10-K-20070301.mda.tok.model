item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
executive summary our business we are an international offshore energy company that provides development solutions and other key services to the open energy market as well as to our own oil and gas properties 
our oil and gas business is a prospect generation  exploration  development and production company 
employing our own key services and methodologies we seek to lower finding and development f d costs  relative to industry norms 
industry overview and major influences the offshore oil and gas industry originated in the early s as producers began to explore and develop the new frontier of offshore fields 
the industry has grown significantly since the s with service providers taking on greater roles on behalf of the producers 
industry standards were established during this period largely in response to the emergence of the north sea as a major province leading the way into a new hostile frontier 
the methodology of these standards was driven by the requirement of mitigating the risk of developing relatively large reservoirs in a then challenging environment 
these standards are still largely adhered to today for all developments even if they are small and the frontier is more understood 
there are factors we believe will influence the industry in the coming years increasing world demand for oil and natural gas  global production rates peaking  globalization of the natural gas market  increasing number of mature and small reservoirs  increasing ratio of contribution to global production from marginal fields  increasing offshore activity  and increasing number of subsea developments 
our business is substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and natural gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and natural gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration  drilling and production operations 
the level of capital expenditure generally depends on the prevailing views of future oil and natural gas prices  which are influenced by numerous factors  including but not limited to worldwide economic activity  demand for oil and natural gas  especially in the united states  china and india  economic and political conditions in the middle east and other oil producing regions  actions taken by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  
table of contents the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  the cost of offshore exploration for and production and transportation of oil and gas  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain external capital for exploration  development and production operations  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  technological advances affecting energy exploration production transportation and consumption  weather conditions  environmental and other governmental regulations  and tax policies 
activity summary over the last few years we continued to evolve the helix model by completing a variety of transactions and events which have had  and we believe will continue to have  significant impacts on our results of operations and financial condition 
in  we substantially increased the size of our shelf contracting fleet and deepwater pipelay fleet through the acquisition of assets from torch and acergy for a combined purchase price of million 
we also acquired a significant mature property package on the gulf of mexico ocs from murphy oil corporation for million cash and assumption of abandonment liability of million 
finally  we established our reservoir and well tech services group through the acquisition of helix energy limited helix rds for million 
in  we acquired remington  an exploration  development and production company  for approximately billion in cash and stock and the assumption of million of liabilities 
we changed our name from cal dive international  inc to helix energy solutions group  inc  leaving the cal dive name in our diving subsidiary  and in december completed a carve out ipo of that company selling a stake receiving pre tax net proceeds of million from cdi and a pre tax dividend of million from cdi s revolver 
we acquired the caesar  a foot cable lay vessel which we intend to convert into a deepwater pipelay asset total acquisition plus estimated conversion cost is million 
we also acquired a interest in the phoenix field formerly known as typhoon where we expect to deploy a minimal floating production system in mid we also expanded our subsea well intervention services in australia through the acquisition of of seatrac 
finally  we moved our stock listing from nasdaq helx to the new york stock exchange hlx in july in february  we announced an update on drilling activity at our owned noonan prospect on garden banks block in  feet of water 
since operations commenced in october  we have completed the drilling of an exploratory well and two appraisal sidetracks 
formation evaluation from wireline logs  pressure analysis and sidewall cores have successfully delineated our reservoir for completion of the well 
results of operations our operations are conducted through the following lines of businesses contracting services operations and oil and gas operations 
we have disaggregated our contracting services operations into three reportable segments in accordance with sfas as a result  our reportable segments consist of the following contracting services formerly known as deepwater contracting  shelf contracting  oil and gas formerly known as oil and gas production and production facilities 
contracting services operations include services such as deepwater pipelay  well operations  robotics and reservoir and well tech services 
shelf contracting operations consist of assets deployed primarily for diving related activities and shallow water construction
