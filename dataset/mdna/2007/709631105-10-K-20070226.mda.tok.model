overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  storage  treatment  and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets  designing and manufacturing standard  modified  and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components  thermal management products  and accessories 
in  we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately million in to approximately billion in we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling billion 
our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  storage  treatment  and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense  security  medical  and networking 
we believe we have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and the highest enclosures brand recognition in the industry in north america 
from mid through  the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets 
from through  sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors  new products  and higher demand in targeted markets 
in addition  through the success of our pentair integrated management system pims initiatives  we have increased technical products segment operating margins to our goal of and achieved consecutive quarters of year over year operating margin expansion 
key trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in the future the housing market and new pool starts slowed dramatically in the first quarter of and shrank in the last three quarters of the year 
we believe that construction of new homes and new pools starts in north america affects approximately of the sales of our water group  especially for our pool and spa businesses 
the impact of this downturn reduced our expected revenues in and will likely continue to have an uncertain impact on our revenues in we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group 
end user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august 
the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sales early buy programs generally including extended payment terms and or additional discounts 
demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and weather patterns  particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 
we expect our operations to continue to benefit from our pims initiatives which include strategy deployment  lean enterprise with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management  and lean operations  and ignite  our process to drive organic growth 
we are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses 
we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as metals and other costs such as pensions  health care and insurance 
we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds of our net income 
free cash flow  which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  including both continuing and discontinued operations  plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment  exceeded million for the fourth consecutive year in and was million in see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources of this report 
we experienced unfavorable foreign currency effects on net sales in the first quarter of and favorable foreign currency effects in the second  third and fourth quarters of overall  we experienced favorable foreign currency effect on net sales in our currency effect is primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may or may not trend favorably in the future 
the effective tax rate for was due in part to favorable resolution of prior tax years and higher utilization of foreign tax credits 
we continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate 
the tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution 
we expect our full year effective tax rate in to be between and 
outlook in  our operating objectives include the following continue to drive operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives  with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management  and lean operations  continue the integration of acquisitions and realize identified synergistic opportunities  continue proactive talent development  particularly in international management and other key functional areas  achieve organic sales growth in excess of market growth rates  particularly in international markets  and continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our existing platforms in our water and technical products groups 
the ability to achieve our operating objectives will depend  to a certain extent  on factors outside our control

cash provided by operating activities was million in  or million higher compared with the same period in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory builds to support customers during product transfers and plant consolidation activities in water

we use the credit facility as back up liquidity to support of commercial paper outstanding 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding that matures within days 
all of the commercial paper was classified as long term as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis under the credit facility 
in march  we amended and restated our multi currency revolving credit facility  increasing the size of the facility from million to million with a term of five years 
the interest rate on the loans under the million credit facility is libor plus 
interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 
effective following the close of business on july   we completed the acquisition of wicor 
we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with an million committed line of credit the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility 
the interest rate on the bridge facility and loans under the credit facility during the period of the bridge facility was libor plus on october   we received approximately million of proceeds from the sale of our tools group to bdk 
as required under the terms of the bridge facility  we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and additional borrowings under the credit facility to pay off the bridge facility 
following payment of the bridge facility and based on our existing credit ratings  the interest rate on loans under the credit facility decreased to libor plus 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  in addition to the credit facility  we have million of uncommitted credit facilities  under which we had drawn million in borrowings as of december  our current credit ratings are as follows long term debt current rating rating agency rating outlook standard poor s bbb stable moody s baa stable we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 
a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation  a specific class of financial obligations  or a specific financial program 
the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors  insurers  or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated 
the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or long term rating 
it focuses on identifiable events and short term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies 
a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 
prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 
we issue short term commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard poor s or moody s 
even though our short term commercial paper is unrated  we believe a downgrade in our long term debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 
we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long term debt by either standard poor s or moody s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets 
however  depending upon market conditions  the amount  timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected 
if both of our long term debt ratings were downgraded to below bbb baa  our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 
in the event of a downgrade of our long term debt rating  the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our credit facility and million private placement fixed rate note could increase 
while the credit facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings  we do not have any agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of million in total indebtedness and  million in shareholders equity 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was  compared with at december  our targeted debt to total capital ratio is or less 
we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest and service debt  and to pay dividends to shareholders 
in order to meet these cash requirements  we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds  and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
we paid dividends in of million  compared with million in and million in we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of million of our common stock 
on july   the board of directors increased our repurchase authorization to million  and on september   the board of directors further increased our repurchase authorization to million 
as of december   we had purchased  shares for million pursuant to these programs during the board of directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase program in with a maximum dollar limit of million 
this authorization expires on december  as of february   we had not repurchased any additional shares under this plan and  accordingly  we have the authority in to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of million 
in and  respectively  we repurchased  shares and  shares of our common stock under similar authorizations 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity payments due by period more than in thousands years total long term debt obligations interest obligations on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations  net of sublease rentals other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations  net in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations  we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt 
as of december   variable interest rate debt  including the effects of derivative financial instruments  was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
we expect to make contributions in the range of million to million to our pension plans in the expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 
other financial measures in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income 
we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds conversion of net income 
free cash flow and conversion of net income are non gaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance 
we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt 
in addition  free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation based incentives 
our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities twelve months ended december in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from sale of property and equipment free cash flow net income conversion of net income in  our objective is to generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds of net income 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments and contingencies environmental we have been named as defendants  targets  or potentially responsible parties prp in a small number of environmental clean ups  in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status 
to date  none of these claims have resulted in clean up costs  fines  penalties  or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations 
we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases  such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in  the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in  the disposition of lincoln industrial in  and the disposition of the tools group in  we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations 
we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 
we settled some of the claims in prior years  to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 
in addition  there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites  including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in  which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites 
we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites 
we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  for both divested and acquired businesses 
when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as of december  and  our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately million and million  respectively 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental clean up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
stand by letters of credit in the ordinary course of business  predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products  we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog 
in addition  we issue financial stand by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self insurance programs and certain legal matters 
as of december  and  the outstanding value of these instruments totaled million and million  respectively
