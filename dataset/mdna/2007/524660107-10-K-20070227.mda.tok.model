we plan to continue developing technology that creates opportunities for growth in new markets 
finally  we are committed to establishing a global presence  particularly in asia 
we believe this will enable us to supply customers as they source some products overseas 
acquisitions may play a part in accomplishing these goals 
industrial materials segment logo the high quality of the industrial materials segment s products and service  together with low cost  have made us north america s leading supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing 
our wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately  tons  nearly all of which is used by our own wire mills 
we have six wire mills producing more than  tons of steel wire annually 
our tubing group operates two major plants that supply nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing 
in addition to supplying our internal requirements  the industrial materials segment supplies many external customers with quality wire and tubing products 

table of contents products our industrial materials segment products include steel rod drawn wire welded steel tubing specialty wire products  such as wire ties to bale cotton and waste materials and shaped wire for automotive and medical supply applications fabricated tube components customers leggett uses about half of our wire output and about one quarter of our welded steel tubing output to manufacture our own products 
for example  we use our wire and steel tubing to make bedding and furniture components motion furniture mechanisms commercial fixtures  point of purchase displays  shelving and storage products automotive seat components and frames the industrial materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers  including bedding and furniture makers automotive seating manufacturers lawn and garden equipment manufacturers atv and rv producers mechanical spring makers waste recyclers  waste removal businesses and cotton bailers medical supply businesses key strategies the core strategy of our wire and tubing groups is to efficiently supply consistent  high quality raw material to other leggett businesses 
we also provide that benefit to our external trade customers 
we expect growth to occur as our internal requirements expand  both domestically and abroad 
additionally  we will pursue further opportunities in current and new markets 
we also expect to increase our value adding capabilities in forming  shaping and welding our wire and tubing 
this may occur through start up operations or acquisitions

introducing new capabilities and products creates potential for us to grow our existing relationships and expand into new markets 
growing our global presence to serve developing markets and to expand our sourcing options will remain a key objective  as will assisting our customers with vendor consolidation to reduce the complexity and cost of their supply chain 
our machinery group designs and manufactures equipment that is used to produce the proprietary innersprings we develop for our bedding customers 
in most cases  this equipment is not otherwise available in the marketplace 
providing proprietary machinery is a critical function of our machinery group and a key factor to the success of our bedding operations 
in addition  we expect to use new technologies developed in our machinery group to improve efficiency in our own plants and those of our customers 
the key growth strategies for our commercial vehicle products group are geographic expansion and new product development 
certain markets for truck bodies in the united states are supplied by smaller regional manufacturers 
we aim to expand into those markets which have high concentrations of end users 
we expect to provide improved product functionality and quality to customers by focusing on product innovation

table of contents company wide growth initiatives in june  we staffed a new  senior level position responsible for company wide engineering and innovation efforts 
this position will augment and coordinate the company s many technology efforts by providing our innovators a single focal point and senior representative on the executive team 
in september we established five new business development positions  each reporting directly to one of our five segment presidents 
we are also establishing a new corporate function with responsibility to uncover opportunities in growing markets that leggett does not yet serve or that do not yet exist  investigate current and potential customers unmet needs and provide insight and trend analysis regarding markets  customers and consumers 
these appointments help us reenergize the company s focus on innovation  product development and growth 
we expect greater idea generation  improved accountability for growth  movement into faster growing markets and a renewed company wide appreciation of the urgency and importance of innovation and growth 
acquisitions and divestitures historically  our typical acquisition targets have been small  private  profitable  entrepreneurial companies that manufacture goods either within our existing product lines or one step away from those product lines and complementary to our existing businesses 
in addition  we expect to use acquisitions to enter growing markets that leggett does not yet serve 
we do not follow a fixed timetable for buying companies 
rather  we attempt to opportunistically take advantage of circumstances as they arise 
as a result  the pace and size of acquisitions in any given year could be significantly more or less than our long term average 
activities we acquired five businesses in  representing approximately million in annualized sales 
all five acquisitions were made by our residential furnishings segment 
the year s largest acquired company produces rubber carpet underlay 
in total  carpet underlay represents approximately of the company s revenues 
we believe we are the largest provider  in terms of revenue  of carpet underlay in north america  and the only manufacturer of all major types of carpet cushioning material 
we acquired two geo components operations in these acquisitions expanded our geographic presence and broadened our product offerings in systems for soil stabilization  erosion control  and drainage and flood control 
we divested five businesses in with aggregate annualized sales of million 
two of these divestitures were in our residential furnishings segment a small innerspring manufacturer in russia and a fabric dye and finishing business 
we also sold a steel coil slitter business and a specialty drawn wire business  both in the industrial materials segment 
finally  we sold a small industrial sewing machine manufacturer in the specialized products segment 
activities we acquired businesses during with annualized sales of approximately million broken down by segment as follows residential furnishings million specialized products million 
table of contents our largest acquisition was america s body company 
abc s main products are van interiors the racks  shelving and cabinets installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks and dump trucks 
this acquisition spurred the creation of our commercial vehicle products group in the specialized products segment 
with combined sales of approximately million  we believe our commercial vehicle products group is the second largest supplier  in terms of revenue  in a billion us market 
we also acquired two geo components operations in these acquisitions strengthened our presence in the fragmented us market for geo components  estimated at billion in annual sales and consisting of many small regional suppliers 
we divested four businesses in with aggregate annualized sales of million 
in our residential furnishings segment we sold a wiping cloth business 
we sold a small automotive cable producer in our specialized products segment 
finally  we sold assets relating to the production of stud wall fixture partitions and slotted wall displays  which were part of the commercial fixturing components segment 
activities we acquired nine businesses during with annualized sales of approximately million broken down by segment as follows residential furnishings million commercial fixturing components million specialized products million in residential furnishings  the company acquired three businesses  the largest of which designs and produces comforters  decorative pillows and other top of bed accessories

our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign state 
these risks include nationalization of private enterprises political instability in certain countries foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates

table of contents distribution of products in each of our segments  we sell and distribute our products primarily through the company s sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials the products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials  and among the most important are various types of steel  such as scrap  rod  wire  coil  sheet and angle iron foam chemicals and foam scrap aluminum woven and non woven fabrics leggett supplies its own raw materials for many of the products we make 
for example  we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire  which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas displays  shelving and racks for retailers automotive seating components we currently supply roughly two thirds of our steel rod requirements through our rod mill 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our us requirements for steel wire 
we also produce welded steel tubing  dimension lumber and plastic components both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers 
we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials used by the company 
however  we have experienced volatility in raw material prices in the last three years  most notably in the following areas steel our steel purchases have ranged from of cost of goods sold over the past few years 
in  increased steel prices added more than million to leggett s costs over  and we implemented steel related price increases for many of our products 
during and  steel prices dropped slightly then stabilized 
steel scrap in and  unusual market conditions led to unsustainably high profit margins on our rod production 
in  the market began returning to more normal levels 
chemicals  fibers and resins in  we experienced significant inflation in chemicals  fibers and resins generally driven by changes in oil prices 
these costs remained relatively flat in  and the majority of the cost increases are now reflected in our selling prices 
foam scrap the cost of foam scrap increased steadily throughout with the overall cost of scrap doubling from the prices at year end aluminum aluminum prices began increasing in the last half of  peaked in early  and stabilized by midyear at levels approximately above those from a year earlier 
we are generally less exposed to cost changes in this commodity because of the pricing arrangements we have with our customers 
the future pricing of steel and other raw materials is uncertain it could increase or decrease in the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs  should they occur  could influence our earnings 
higher raw material costs in and led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components 
table of contents were replaced with lower cost components  causing us to shift production accordingly 
this has primarily impacted profit margins in our residential furnishings segment 
customers we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long term business relationships 
no customer accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenues in our top customers accounted for less than of our consolidated revenues in some of our segments have customers whose purchases exceed of the segment s sales in commercial fixturing components has one customer accounting for approximately  aluminum products has one customer accounting for approximately and specialized products has one customer accounting for approximately 
the loss of any one or more of these customers may have a material adverse effect upon the relevant segment 
patents and trademarks leggett holds approximately  patents and has over in process for its various product lines 
we have registered almost  trademarks  with more than in process 
no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our business as a whole or to any individual segment 
most of our patents and trademarks relate to products sold in the specialized products and residential furnishings segments 
some of our most significant trademarks include semi flex  lok fast and dyna lock boxspring components and foundations mira coil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings nova bond and rollout insulator pads for mattresses adjustamagic adjustable electric beds wall hugger recliner chair mechanisms super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag wire forms used in seating tack jump and pattern link quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lator automotive seating products amco and rhc fixtures and displays spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing machines abc america s body co  quietflex and masterack equipment and accessories for vans and trucks research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri  and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to precisely calculate the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we estimate the cost of research and development was approximately to million in each of the last three years 
employees as of december   the company had  active employees  of which  were engaged in production 
of the total active employees   are international employees 
labor unions represent  of 
table of contents our employees 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during the table below shows our employees by segment 
segment employees residential furnishings commercial fixturing components aluminum products industrial materials specialized products unallocated eg  corporate headquarters total competition many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we tend to attract and retain customers through product quality  innovation  competitive pricing and customer service  while many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america  in terms of revenue  of the following components for residential furniture and bedding retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays components for office furniture non automotive aluminum die castings drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems carpet underlay adjustable beds bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
when prices for key materials such as steel  aluminum and chemicals are relatively level throughout the world  we can generally produce our components at a lower cost in the us because of our products low labor content 
however  in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe our operations should be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
accordingly  at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
we have experienced increased price competition in certain us markets from chinese bedding component manufacturers 
this has primarily occurred with low end commodity products in markets easily served by major ocean ports 
we have reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices and developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
we believe asian manufacturers currently benefit from lower commodity costs certain commodities may be subsidized at times by asian governments  lenient attitudes toward safety and environmental matters  and currency rates that are pegged to the us dollar rather than free floating 
however  when exporting to the us  
table of contents asian manufacturers must overcome higher transportation costs and increased working capital needs  and may have difficulty matching us manufacturers level of service  flexibility and logistics 
seasonality as a diversified manufacturer  we do not experience significant seasonality  although our quarter to quarter sales have generally varied in proportion to the total year by roughly 
the timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 
our five segments tend to experience seasonality as follows residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during the late summer and fall months 
commercial fixturing components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
aluminum products sales are proportionately greater in the first two quarters due to typically stronger spring and early summer demand for lawn and garden equipment and barbeque grills 
industrial materials minimal variation in sales throughout the year 
specialized products relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
backlog our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments 
production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships

risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking and other statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 
costs of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we often attempt to implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
we encounter greater difficulty in implementing these price increases in industries where we have a smaller market share and in products that are of a commodity nature 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
steel is our most significant raw material 
during the price of certain types of steel nearly doubled 
steel costs were more stable at high levels in and  although there were some quarter to quarter fluctuations in those years 
these market conditions in and resulted in an unusually high spread between steel scrap costs and steel rod prices 
as a result  this spread created unsustainable margins and earnings at our steel rod mill 
in  the average rod margins narrowed primarily due to changes in the global steel market 
if this narrowing continues  it will negatively impact our results of operations 
our operations can also be negatively impacted by the cost of other raw materials 
throughout  but particularly in the last half of the year  we experienced higher costs associated with the oil based raw materials  such as chemicals  fibers and resins 
in  the cost of these materials remained relatively flat at high levels 
in  the cost of foam scrap increased steadily with the overall cost doubling from the prices at the end of in  higher raw material costs led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
this trend continued in in some cases  higher priced components were replaced with lower priced components 
this has primarily impacted our residential furnishings product mix and decreased profit margins 
if this trend continues it could negatively impact our results of operations 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that may affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore drive demand for our components and products 
some of 
table of contents these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
significant changes in these economic factors may negatively impact the demand for our products and our results of operations 
demand in the north american bedding and automotive markets was weak for most of if demand in these markets does not improve  our ability to achieve our long term targets for sales  margins and earnings for the company as a whole and for the residential furnishing and specialized product segments may be negatively impacted 
asian competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished product from asia 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  aluminum and chemicals  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed 
if our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe that our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
at year end  we operated facilities in china 
if demand in china and other foreign countries increases at a more rapid rate than we are able to establish operations  our market share and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
also  we have experienced increased price competition in the us from chinese bedding component manufacturers 
this has primarily occurred with low end commodity products in markets easily served by major ocean ports 
we have reacted to this competition in by selectively adjusting prices and developing new products that help our customers reduce total costs 
if this price competition intensifies we could lose market share and our earnings could be negatively impacted 
higher energy costs could adversely affect our operating results 
higher prices for natural gas  electricity and fuel increase our production and delivery costs 
many of our large manufacturing operations are heavy users of natural gas and electricity 
our inability to respond to these cost increases by raising selling prices could negatively affect our operating results 
in recent years  higher energy prices impacted consumer demand in certain markets 
higher energy prices leave less disposable income to purchase products that contain our components 
bedding demand has been soft in recent quarters  and we believe this is partially due to the impact higher energy prices have on the consumer 
if energy prices increase  this could negatively impact demand for our products and reduce our sales  profit margins and earnings 
we may not be able to continue improving operating performance in our fixture display group 
our fixture display group is operating at levels below our long term expectations 
we were hampered in our efforts to improve operating margins in by new program start up costs and integration inefficiencies associated with the rhc spacemaster acquisition 
in completing the restructuring plan we announced in september  eight facilities in the fixture display group have been consolidated  sold or closed 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we have reduced our productive capacity in the fixture display group by approximately million 
we are realizing expected restructuring benefits  however  margins are still not at desired levels 
while overall demand in the fixture display group has been difficult to predict  we are not anticipating a near term change in the market 
earnings must continue to improve in our fixture display group from current levels or further restructuring may be initiated 

table of contents our assets are subject to potential goodwill impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
as of december  goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or  of our total assets 
we test goodwill and other assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
we could be required to recognize non cash reductions in our net income caused by the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  which could be material 
as disclosed above  our fixture display group has experienced deterioration in profitability compared to historical levels 
the restructuring plan and other initiatives have led to improved earnings in the fixture display group  but additional improvement is necessary 
about million of goodwill is associated with the fixture display group 
if earnings in this group fail to more consistently meet forecasted levels a goodwill impairment charge may be necessary 
we may fail to meet our acquisition growth goals 
one of our growth strategies is to increase our sales and earnings and expand our markets through acquisitions 
in the company acquired five businesses 
we expect these acquisitions to add approximately million in annual revenue 
furthermore  we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future when appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions that are sufficient to meet our goals 
further  our acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
our long term targets for sales  margins and earnings may not be reached if we fail to achieve our acquisition growth goals 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales were generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
we cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results

introduction what we do leggett platt is a fortune diversified manufacturer that conceives  designs  and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes  retail stores  offices  and automobiles 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 

table of contents we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  adjustable beds  carpet underlay  retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays  components for office furniture  non automotive aluminum die castings  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and machinery used by the bedding industry for wire forming  sewing  and quilting 
our segments our year old company is composed of business units under five reportable segments  with approximately  employee partners  and more than facilities located in over countries around the world 
our five segments are residential furnishings  commercial fixturing components  aluminum products  industrial materials  and specialized products 
logo residential furnishings this segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell adjustable beds  bed frames  ornamental beds  carpet cushion  geo components includes synthetic fabrics and various other products used in ground stabilization  drainage protection  and erosion and weed control  as well as silt fencing  chemicals  seed  and fertilizer  and other finished products 
commercial fixturing components operations in this segment produce a store fixtures  point of purchase displays  and storage products used by retailers  b chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers  and c injection molded plastic components used in a variety of end products 
aluminum products this segment provides die cast aluminum components for customers that manufacture many products including motorcycles  diesel and small engines  outdoor lighting fixtures  appliances  power tools  and consumer electronics 

table of contents industrial materials these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our wire and tubing is used to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  retail store fixtures and displays  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
specialized products from this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we design  produce  and sell van interiors the racks  shelving  and cabinets installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks used in light to medium duty commercial trucks 
we also design and produce machinery  both for our own use and for others  including bedding manufacturers 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with no single one representing even of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 
we primarily sell our products through our own sales employees  although we also use independent sales representatives and distributors in some of our businesses 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand for our products  raw material cost trends  energy costs  and competition 
market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
despite generally favorable economic conditions in recent years  demand in some of our markets has been weak 
in  a decrease in bedding market demand led to lower volume in our businesses serving that industry 
in addition  north american automotive production declined in  and this also had an adverse affect on some of our operations 
raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors do not have 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
purchasing arrangements vary considerably across the company 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly our raw material costs generally move with the market 
in certain of our businesses  we have longer term purchase contracts with pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions 
however  when commodities experience extreme inflation  vendors do not always honor those contracts 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
we have few long term  fixed pricing contracts with customers 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we 
table of contents typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
although we are generally able to pass through most cost increases  we encounter greater difficulty i in businesses where we have a smaller market share  and ii in products that are of a commodity nature 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can impact our earnings 
steel is our most significant raw material 
during  the price of certain types of steel nearly doubled  but we were able to recover most of these higher costs through selling price increases 
steel costs were more stable at high levels in and  although there were some quarter to quarter fluctuations in those years 
unusual market conditions in and early resulted in unsustainably high profit margins on our steel rod production 
in  the market began returning to more normal levels 
in  we experienced significant inflation in chemicals  fibers  and resins generally driven by changes in oil prices 
these costs remained relatively flat at high levels in  and the majority of the cost increases are now reflected in our selling prices 
in addition to steel and oil based materials  we also use significant amounts of aluminum  but we are generally less exposed to cost changes in this commodity because of the pricing arrangements we have with our customers 
when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect during and  as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address the significant steel and chemical inflation from recent years 
our profit margins were negatively impacted as a result of this de contenting 
energy costs higher prices for natural gas  electricity  and fuel increase our production and delivery costs 
many of our large manufacturing operations are heavy users of natural gas and electricity 
our ability to respond to these cost increases by raising selling prices affects our operating results 
we continuously monitor natural gas price trends and have locked in prices on a portion of our natural gas requirements for the next three years 
the details of those arrangements are discussed in note p to the financial statements on page higher energy prices can also impact consumer demand in certain markets 
as consumers pay more for fuel and utilities  they have less disposable income to purchase products that contain our components 
we believe consumers purchased fewer mattresses during in part due to the impact higher energy prices had on disposable income 
competition many of our markets are highly competitive  with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
we believe we gain competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  superior manufacturing expertise and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  long lived relationships with customers  and greater financial strength 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
when prices for key materials such as steel  aluminum  and 
table of contents chemicals are comparable throughout the world  it is generally cheaper to produce our components in the us because of our products low labor content 
however  in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
accordingly  at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
in recent years  we have experienced increased price competition in the us from chinese bedding component manufacturers 
this has primarily occurred with lower end commodity products in geographic markets easily served by major ocean ports 
we reacted to this competition in by selectively adjusting prices  and also by developing new proprietary products that help reduce our customers total costs 
the increased price competition for bedding components is partially due to lower wire costs in china 
asian manufacturers currently benefit from lower costs for commodities such as steel and chemicals 
we believe these commodities are subsidized at times by asian governments 
when there is a cost imbalance in global commodities  this can impact pricing and demand for our products 
asian manufacturers also benefit from lenient attitudes toward safety and environmental matters  as well as currency rates that are pegged to the us dollar rather than free floating 
however  when exporting to the us  they must overcome higher transportation costs  increased working capital needs  and difficulty matching us manufacturers levels of service  flexibility  and logistics 
restructuring and asset impairments in the third quarter of  we launched a significant broad based restructuring project to reduce excess capacity and improve performance in a number of our businesses 
that restructuring was completed in except for some remaining asset sales 
as part of the restructuring plan  we identified underutilized or underperforming facilities that were subsequently closed  consolidated  or sold the closure and consolidation initiative 
we also took a more critical look at other underperforming operations  as a result  we modified or accelerated restructuring activities that were previously underway  and identified other operations with impaired assets 
logo net costs associated with all and restructuring related activities were approximately million  of which million were recognized in and million were recognized in these charges include 
table of contents the cost of plant closures building cleanup and repair  equipment relocation  employee severance pay  asset impairment  inventory obsolescence  and similar items  partially offset by gains from asset sales 
of these net costs  about two thirds were non cash items 
we estimate future gains from asset sales in the range of million to million  but the timing of these gains is uncertain and actual amounts could fall outside this estimated range 
of the facilities under the closure and consolidation initiative  about half were in residential furnishings  one quarter were in commercial fixturing components  and the remainder were in industrial materials and specialized products 
these operations had total revenue of roughly million per year 
most of this volume shifted to other facilities  but as anticipated  we reduced sales by million per year as we divested small  non core operations and walked away from unprofitable business 
the majority of this volume reduction occurred in the residential and commercial segments 
we expect an ongoing annual pre tax earnings benefit from the restructuring plan of approximately million 
we realized about half of these benefits in  and should see the full impact in and subsequent years 
the benefits result primarily from the elimination of fixed costs associated with closed facilities  and a reduction in the number of employees 
we provide additional details about restructuring and asset impairment in note n to the financial statements on page fixture display performance sales volume in our fixture display business declined slightly in while overall demand in this business has been difficult to predict  we are not expecting a significant near term change in the market 
although we are realizing the expected restructuring benefits  margins for this business are still not at desired levels 
efforts to improve performance are continuing on a number of fronts 
we are implementing certain production process improvements  and are evaluating others aimed at reducing operating costs and increasing speed to market 
we expect our renewed emphasis on innovation and product development to result in new product introductions that will allow us to expand our customer base  as well as increase sales to existing customers 
in addition  we are continuing our efforts to maximize capacity utilization and will consolidate or close additional operations if necessary 
results of operations vs 
during  we attained record sales and earnings 
sales grew for the year  primarily from acquisitions 
earnings increased due to several factors  including lower restructuring related expenses  absence of s higher workers compensation costs  and reimbursement of canadian lumber duties 
we also realized benefits from the restructuring  as expected  in the later part of the year 
further details about these items and our consolidated and segment results are discussed below 

table of contents consolidated results the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from to  and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes amount dollar amounts in millions  except per share data net sales year ended december  acquisition sales growth restructuring related closures divestitures internal sales growth year ended december  net earnings year ended december  lower restructuring related charges lower workers compensation expense reimbursement of canadian lumber duty other offsetting factors including restructuring benefits  income from recent acquisitions  product mix  price competition  and higher interest expense year ended december  earnings per share december  earnings per share december  acquisitions contributed most of the full year sales gains  but this increase was partially offset by declines  as expected  from restructuring and divestitures 
the restructuring related sales decrease occurred as we chose to walk away from business that was marginally profitable  or in some instances  unprofitable 
internal sales ie  excluding acquisitions and divestitures were roughly flat for the year 
lower volume in certain businesses offset inflation related sales growth from price increases we implemented to recover higher raw material costs 
the price increases related primarily to higher costs for chemicals and other oil based raw materials early in the year versus lower levels in early and higher aluminum costs 
in the north american bedding market  volume was weak for most of the year and softened further beginning in september 
automotive demand  and to a lesser extent  custom store fixture demand was also soft for most of the year 
in contrast  our residential furniture components  office furniture components  machinery  and foam businesses performed very well 
these trends are discussed in the segment results below 
net earnings and earnings per share increased versus primarily due to lower restructuring related charges costs associated with the restructuring plan  discussed on page  decreased in lower workers compensation expense in  we significantly increased our reserves for workers compensation to reflect higher costs of medical care and longer durations of claims 
workers compensation costs returned to normal levels in reimbursement of canadian lumber duty in late  we received a refund of duties that we had paid to the us customs department over the previous four years on imports of softwood lumber from canada 

table of contents earnings benefited as expected from restructuring related operating improvements during the last half of acquisitions completed over the past several months including those completed in late also contributed to the earnings increase 
in addition  a lower share count drove a portion of the increase in earnings per share 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by product mix higher raw material costs in recent years have led some customers to modify their product design and replace higher cost components with lower cost and lower margin components 
price competition in  we experienced price competition in certain markets  and we responded by selectively reducing prices of certain of our products 
higher net interest expense million segment results in the following section we discuss sales and earnings before interest and taxes ebit for each of our segments 
reported amounts for and in the commercial fixturing components segment and the specialized products segment have been restated for an organizational change effective january  this change moved commercial vehicle products operations from commercial fixturing components to specialized products  and also moved a small office components operation from specialized products to commercial fixturing components

internal sales grew slightly during the year  mainly due to inflation in our foam businesses and unit growth in upholstered furniture components 
however  weak demand and price competition in the us bedding market  in addition to de contenting by some of our customers those who have chosen to replace higher cost components with lower cost components has offset much of the internal sales gains

further margin gains should come from the restructuring benefits and additional volume  but other operating initiatives that are underway should contribute about two thirds of the remaining improvement needed to reach targeted levels 
aluminum products sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisitions net of restructuring divestitures sales increased in solely from internal growth 
inflation was the main driver we passed through higher raw material costs but was partially offset by slight declines in unit volumes 
small engine sales were weak during the last half of  in part due to the absence of significant weather events that drive generator and snow blower sales  outdoor grill volume also declined  offsetting gains in several of our other markets during the year 

table of contents ebit and ebit margins increased versus from higher sales benefits from the restructuring and other operational progress over the past year lower restructuring related costs million these benefits were partially offset by start up costs at our new facility in auburn  alabama  and higher energy costs

in our automotive business  market weakness in north america  particularly in larger vehicles that contain more seats with higher end features  has been offset by growth in asia and europe 

table of contents machinery volume was stronger in  reflecting improved demand for bedding related equipment in certain international markets 
in the commercial vehicle products business  demand for fleet van interiors racks  shelving  and cabinets installed in service vans grew in  but we experienced market softness for commercial truck equipment truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks  caused in part by production cuts at the auto and truck manufacturers  and associated shortages of commercial truck chassis 
this situation was corrected late in  and truck chassis are now available 
ebit and ebit margins increased versus in part due to lower restructuring related costs million earnings from recently acquired companies lower workers compensation expense million operational benefits from the restructuring currency factors million offset some of these gains 
although segment margins improved this year  they are still below targeted levels in part due to lower volume in north american automotive and portions of the commercial vehicle businesses  as well as continued weakness of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
results of operations vs 
we achieved record sales in  exceeding the prior year by 
earnings for the year decreased primarily due to restructuring  asset impairment  and inventory obsolescence charges related to the restructuring plan

table of contents internal growth and acquisitions each contributed about half the net sales increase 
internal sales growth ie  growth excluding acquisitions and divestitures was mainly due to inflation we implemented price increases to recover higher raw material costs 
these increases related primarily to higher costs for steel early in the year versus lower levels in early  and for chemicals  fibers  and resins throughout by late  steel costs had declined versus peak levels in the last half of  and we experienced modest deflation in a few businesses 
unit volumes were mixed across our various markets 
for the full year  we posted solid growth in our businesses supplying upholstered furniture components  but these gains were offset by declines in our bedding and automotive businesses 
volume was essentially flat in many of our other markets 
these trends are discussed in the segment results which follow 
inflation was a significant challenge again in the largest impact resulted from higher oil prices  which affect the cost of raw materials such as chemicals  fibers  and resins 
many of these costs rose throughout the year  but the increases accelerated following the hurricanes 
in response  we raised prices to our customers  and by year end  the higher costs were reflected in our selling prices 
net earnings and earnings per share decreased versus primarily due to restructuring related charges as shown in the previous table  restructuring related charges represent the majority of the decrease in earnings 
these charges include the cost of plant closures  equipment relocation  employee severance pay  asset impairment  inventory obsolescence  and other similar costs associated with the restructuring plan discussed on page higher workers compensation expense in  we significantly increased our reserves for workers compensation to reflect higher costs of medical care and longer durations of claims  since more treatment options are available and can continue over longer periods of time 
earnings were also affected by higher energy and transportation costs  and a weaker us dollar which caused margin declines in our canadian operations that sell in us dollars but incur costs in canadian dollars 
these declines were partially offset by benefits from sales growth and a tax benefit from a planned foreign entity restructuring and cash repatriation transaction 
this transaction generated a net tax benefit of approximately million 
segment results in the following section  we discuss sales and earnings before interest and taxes ebit for each of our segments 
a reconciliation of segment ebit to consolidated ebit is provided in note l to the financial statements on page all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in  segment margins generally benefited under the fifo method from the effect of rising commodity costs 
in  declining steel costs caused margins mainly in residential and industrial to decrease under this same method 
in our consolidated financials  we use the last in  first out lifo method for determining the cost of about half of our inventories 
an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie  outside the segments to convert the appropriate operations to the lifo inventory method

over the past two years  we also increased net debt and used excess cash for a portion of these items  including higher levels of acquisitions and share repurchases 
net debt to net capital has increased from at the beginning of to at the end of our long term goal is to have net debt as a percent of net capital in the range  while maintaining our longstanding single a debt rating 
uses of cash finance growth we use cash to fund growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions

geo components include geotextiles synthetic fabrics used in a variety of applications such as ground stabilization  drainage protection  erosion control  and weed control  silt fencing  seed  and other related products sold primarily to the construction  landscaping  and agricultural industries 
the other acquisitions in the segment established  early in  a small foothold in geo components broadened our product offerings to include all major types of carpet underlay expanded our base of operations producing furniture mechanisms in china added to our businesses that produce and sell bedding components  upholstered furniture components  and top of the bed products commercial fixturing components we acquired one company which had been a key supplier to our fixture display operations for many years 
this company produces retail store fixtures and gondola shelving 
importantly  it gave us an operating presence in china from which to serve the growing domestic chinese market 
the acquisition expanded our manufacturing capacity but did not significantly increase our reported sales since most of the product is sold to other leggett operations for distribution in the us specialized products we acquired america s body company  a designer  manufacturer  and supplier of equipment for light to medium duty commercial trucks 
major product categories include van interiors racks  shelving  and cabinets installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks 
we provide additional details about acquisitions in note b to the financial statements on page pay dividends logo actual dividend payout annual dividend rate average eps for prior three years 
table of contents in  we increased our annual dividend for the th consecutive year 
over the last three years  dividends have grown at a compound annual rate 
our long term target for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three years average earnings 
our actual dividend payout has been above those levels in recent years  but as earnings grow  we expect to move back toward that target 
we expect to spend approximately million on dividend payments in repurchase stock logo during the past two years  we have purchased a total of million shares of our stock and reduced our outstanding shares by about 
we typically fund our share repurchases with cash from operations 
in  we purchased million of our shares  considerably more than in any previous year 
this was an opportunistic move that was driven by two main factors additional cash was available as we increased net debt  and a lower stock price in the last few months of the year presented an attractive buying opportunity 
almost six million shares were purchased during a nine week period in the third and fourth quarters  at an average price of about per share 
in  share repurchases were lower versus  in part because we did not have as large an increase in our net debt levels 
the cash available to repurchase shares will fluctuate each year with earnings  capital spending  and the pace of acquisitions 
at a minimum  we typically repurchase shares to replace those issued for employee stock plans approximately two million shares each year 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board of directors to repurchase up to million shares in we expect to spend about million in for acquisitions and share repurchases combined 

table of contents cash from operations logo cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
changes in earnings and working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
in  cash from operations increased over earnings grew in  but were partially offset by increased working capital due to higher inventories 
this inventory increase resulted primarily from softening demand in certain markets and opportunistic pre buys of raw materials 
working capital management remains a priority  and we expect to improve these levels as a percent of sales in in  cash from operations increased  despite lower earnings 
a smaller increase in working capital compared to was the main driver  and resulted primarily from lower inflation 
in  cash from operations benefited from stronger earnings  but was reduced overall by an increase in working capital 
the higher working capital levels were primarily the result of inflation 
working capital levels vary by segment  with the requirements of aluminum products and commercial fixturing components generally higher than overall company averages 
accounts receivable balances in these segments are typically higher due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the aluminum die casting and fixture display businesses 
these same businesses also require higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of their products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time

the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and we show this calculation in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization  each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 
we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows more meaningful comparison to recent periods during which cash has ranged from million to million 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage

table of contents total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities increased million in during the year  we added million of debt  including million of commercial paper borrowings  and repaid million of debt that came due 
since  we ve issued million of fixed rate debt with an average remaining life at the end of of years  and a weighted average coupon rate of 
to further facilitate the issuance of debt and other securities  million remains available under a shelf registration 
in addition to issuing long term notes  we can also raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million  five year revolving credit commitment 
we expect any commercial paper issued under this agreement to be classified as long term debt since we intend to maintain or increase the balance until it is replaced with long term notes 
at the end of  million in commercial paper was outstanding under this program 
with both the shelf registration and the commercial paper program in place  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations and take advantage of growth opportunities 
most of our debt has fixed repayment dates 
at the end of  this debt consisted primarily of term notes 
we have maintained a single a rating from both moody s and standard poor s on our term notes and public debt for over a decade

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed here are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements asset and goodwill impairment inventory workers compensation  general liability  and employee benefit programs credit losses pension accounting income taxes contingencies we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the financial statements on page asset and goodwill impairment long lived assets are assessed annually  and whenever events warrant  to ensure that future cash flows from use of the asset exceed the book value of the asset 
in performing these assessments  we make judgments and estimates about a the future cash flows expected from use and eventual disposition of the assets  and b the assets fair market values 
if actual future cash flows are lower than our estimates  we could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
our eleven reporting units for goodwill purposes are one level below our operating segments  and are the same as the business groups disclosed in item business of our form k 
we assess our reporting units for possible goodwill impairment on an annual basis and whenever events warrant 
in doing so  we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate  internal sales growth  margins  capital expenditure requirements  and working capital requirements 
recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor  but not the only factor  in our assessment 
to date  none of our assessments has determined that a goodwill impairment exists for any of our reporting units 
the total amount of goodwill at december   was billion 
the fixture display group  one of our reporting units  is operating at levels below our long term expectations 
we reviewed this group for potential goodwill impairment as of june  our annual testing date  and determined that the fair market value exceeded the recorded value of the group s assets  so no impairment was recognized 
if earnings in this group fail to more consistently meet forecasted levels  a goodwill impairment charge may be necessary in the future 
about million of goodwill is associated with these operations 
inventory in determining the value of inventories  we make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those 
table of contents items are generally deemed to have no value 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover 
at december   we had reduced inventory values by million approximately of total inventory valued on a fifo basis to account for obsolete and slow moving items 
workers compensation  general liability  and employee benefit programs we are substantially self insured for certain costs related to workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical insurance 
when estimating the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured  we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  valuations provided by independent actuaries where appropriate  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 
in  we significantly increased our reserve for workers compensation to reflect higher costs of medical care and longer durations of claims as more treatment options are available and can continue over longer periods of time 
over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with these insurance programs 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 
credit losses our customers are diverse 
many are small to medium sized companies  and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
we regularly evaluate the ability of our customers to pay what they owe us 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
we consider factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical experience 
the total amount of credit losses over the last three years is million 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled million about of our accounts and notes receivable of million 
pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the two most critical assumptions affecting these estimates are the discount rate and the expected return on assets 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
we have recognized the impact of individual plans funded amounts on the balance sheet  and continue to use a september measurement date for our most significant plans 
to reflect market interest rates  in we increased the discount rate for our major pension plans to from 
we continued to assume long term returns of on the assets of these plans  which was identical to our and assumptions 
sensitivity to changes in the critical assumptions for our major plans is as follows discount rate a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 
million and decrease the plans funded status by approximately million 

table of contents expected return on assets a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
in  we also adjusted to a longer average life expectancy for participants  increasing the total future benefits plan members are anticipated to receive 
this reduced the funded status of the plans by million 
we expect that the combined contribution in to our defined benefit plans will total approximately million 
on december   our defined benefit retirement plan covering non union employees was frozen  thereby eliminating the future accrual of benefits to current participants and closing the plan to new participants 
this plan change should reduce the projected benefit obligation by million  and reduce pension expense by million 
current participants will be moved to a defined contribution plan with a company contribution based upon the current age of the participant 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
at december   five open years were undergoing or subject to audit by the united states internal revenue service irs and canada revenue agency 
in  audits in both countries for the years and were settled in all material respects with no significant adjustments 
in  the irs examination for the years and was concluded 
a final report was issued  and the net refund of approximately million  plus interest  was under review by the joint committee on taxation as of december  the largest issue pertained to a refund claim we made for a worthless stock deduction 
the resolution of this item has been reflected in as a reduction in the company s overall tax rate 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
valuation reserves are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts that we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of such earnings 
contingencies our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
in  we recorded a receivable of million related to an ongoing international dispute over countervailing duties cvd and anti dumping duties add imposed by the united states on softwood lumber imported from canada 
this receivable represented our estimate of the payments to be refunded to us based on the difference between the rates we actually paid and the final rates  as determined by the us department of commerce in their first and second annual administrative reviews 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  the us and canada finalized an agreement to settle this dispute  and as a result  we were refunded million in duties and interest for our claim 
we have recorded this refund as income million in and million in  and provide additional details of this activity and other contingencies in note m to the financial statements on page new accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas establishes  among other things  the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments and is effective for the company january  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial reporting and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation modified the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
specifically  fin changes the application of sfas by establishing criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
additionally  fin provides new rules for measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  as well as disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt fin as of january   and does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value measures  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect fair value measurements have on earnings 
the primary areas in which the company utilizes fair value measures are valuing pension plan assets and liabilities  valuing hedge related derivative financial instruments  allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  and evaluating long term assets for potential impairment 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the company beginning january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas requires the company to recognize the funded status of each of its defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
this requirement is effective as of december   and is reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
future changes in funded status that are not reflected in net income will be recognized in other comprehensive income 
the net impact of the adoption of sfas was a net reduction in shareholders equity of million 
sfas will also require the company to measure the funded status of its plans as of year end beginning with the december  balance sheet 
the company currently uses september as the measurement date for its most significant plans 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab which expresses the staff s views regarding quantifying the effects of financial statement errors 
currently  the two methods most commonly used to quantify misstatements are the rollover method which focuses primarily on the impact of misstatements on the current period income statement and the iron curtain method which focuses primarily on the cumulative effect of misstatements on the balance sheet 
sab requires companies to consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods a dual approach when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors 
sab is effective for the company beginning with its december  annual financial statements 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements
