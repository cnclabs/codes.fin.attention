item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and our selected historical financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
the historical financial information discussed below for periods prior to the completion of our internal restructuring on february  is for anr fund ix holdings  lp and alpha nr holding  inc and subsidiaries on a combined basis  which prior to the completion of our internal restructuring were the owners of a majority of the membership interests of anr holdings  our top tier holding company  and for alpha natural resources  inc and subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for periods from and after the completion of our internal restructuring 
overview we produce  process and sell steam and metallurgical met coal from eight regional business units  which  as of february   are supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and preparation plants located throughout virginia  west virginia  kentucky  and pennsylvania  as well as a road construction business in west virginia that recovers coal 
we also sell coal produced by others  the majority of which we process and or blend with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  providing us with a higher overall margin for the blended product than if we had sold the coals separately 
our sales of steam coal in and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of metallurgical coal in and  which generally sells at a premium over steam coal  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
the increase in our percentage of steam coal sold was mainly due to our recent acquisitions which lead to an overall increase in tons sold while total met tons sold remained unchanged 
our sales of steam coal during and were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states  and our sales of met coal during those years were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states and in several countries in europe  asia and south america 
approximately of our sales revenue in and of our sales revenue in was derived from sales made outside the united states  primarily in canada  japan  brazil  korea and several countries in europe 
this decrease is due to a decrease in export tons sold combined with an increase in our overall sales revenue 
in addition  we generate other revenues from equipment and parts sales  equipment repair  road construction  rentals  royalties  commissions  coal handling  terminal and processing fees  and coal and environmental analysis fees 
we also record revenue for freight and handling charges incurred in delivering coal to our customers  which we treat as being reimbursed by our customers 
however  these freight and handling revenues are offset by equivalent freight and handling costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
our business is seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we generally experience lower sales and hence build coal inventory during the winter months primarily due to the freezing of lakes that we use to transport coal to some of our customers 
our primary expenses are for wages and benefits  supply costs  repair and maintenance expenditures  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs  and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
historically  our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale 
we have one reportable segment  coal operations  which includes all of our revenues and costs from coal production and sales  freight and handling  rentals  commissions  coal handling and processing operations and coal recovery incidental to our road construction operations 
these revenues and costs included in our coal operations segment are reported by us in our coal revenues and cost of coal sales  except for the revenues and costs from rentals  commissions  and coal handling and processing operations  which we report in our other revenues and cost of other revenues  respectively 

table of contents internal restructuring and our initial public offering 
on february   we completed a series of transactions in connection with the internal restructuring for the purpose of transitioning our top tier holding company from a limited liability company to a corporation  and on february   we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
further information regarding our internal restructuring and our initial public offering can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
as a result of our initial public offering and our internal restructuring  we have incurred during the period after the initial public offering and internal restructuring and will continue to incur additional expenses that we did not incur in prior periods  including expenses associated with compliance with corporate governance and periodic financial reporting requirements for public companies 
moreover  all of our income is now subject to income tax and therefore the effective tax rates reflected in our financial statements for periods prior to the internal restructuring are not indicative of our effective tax rates after our internal restructuring 
as part of our internal restructuring  our executive officers and certain other key employees exchanged their interests in anr holdings for shares of our common stock and the right to participate in a distribution of the proceeds we received from the underwriters as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option in connection with the initial public offering 
as a result  we recorded stock based compensation expense equal to the fair value of the unrestricted shares issued and distributions paid in the amount of million for the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the conversion of outstanding options held by members of our management to purchase units of alpha coal management into the acm converted options  we recorded stock based compensation of million in the aggregate amount of stock based compensation expense we recorded in was million  equal to the million of expense associated with distributions paid and the vested portions of shares issued in the internal restructuring and amortization expense from the unvested portions of shares issued in the internal restructuring  and million of amortization expense from the acm converted options 
in addition  we had deferred stock based compensation of million  including million and million related to our internal restructuring and the acm converted options  respectively  that we will record as non cash stock based compensation expense over the remaining term of the applicable two year and five year vesting periods  respectively  thereby reducing our earnings in those periods 
in connection with our internal restructuring  we assumed the obligation of anr holdings to make distributions to affiliates of amci in an aggregate amount of million  representing the approximate incremental tax resulting from the recognition of additional tax liability resulting from our internal restructuring  and first reserve fund ix  lp in an aggregate amount of approximately million  representing the approximate value of tax attributes conveyed as a result of the internal restructuring collectively  the tax distributions 
the tax distributions to affiliates of amci were paid in cash in five equal installments of million on april   june   september   january  and april  the tax distributions to first reserve fund ix  lp are in three installments of approximately million  million and million on december   and  respectively 
we will pay the tax distributions in cash or  to the extent our subsidiaries are not permitted by the terms of our credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes to distribute cash to us to pay the tax distributions  in shares of our common stock 
nkc disposition 
on april   we sold the assets of nkc to an unrelated third party for cash in the amount of million  plus an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of nkc s coal inventory  and the assumption by the buyer of certain liabilities of nkc 
for the six months ended june   nkc contributed revenues of million  an after tax and minority interest loss of million on sales of million tons of steam coal sold 
in connection with the closing of the transaction  national king coal  llc was renamed natcoal llc  and gallup transportation and transloading company  llc was renamed gttc llc 
we recorded a gain on this sale of million and have reported nkc as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein 

table of contents nicewonder acquisition and financing 
on october   we completed the acquisition of certain privately held coal reserves and operations of the nicewonder coal group in southern west virginia and southwestern virginia for an aggregate purchase price of million  consisting of cash at closing in the amount of million  a cash payment of million made to the sellers in april  transaction costs of million  million principal amount of promissory installment notes of one of our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries of which million was paid on november  and million was paid on january   a payment on february  in the amount of million for working capital  and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million for accounting purposes 
for this purpose  the value of the common stock issued was based on the average closing prices of our common stock for the five trading days surrounding october   the date the number of shares to be issued under the terms of the acquisition agreement became fixed without subsequent revision 
in connection with the nicewonder acquisition  we also agreed to make royalty payments to the former owners of the acquired companies in the amount of per ton of coal mined and sold from white flame energy s surface mine no 
the nicewonder acquisition consisted of the purchase of the outstanding capital stock of white flame energy  inc  twin star mining  inc 
and nicewonder contracting  inc  the equity interests of powers shop  llc and buchanan energy  llc and substantially all of the assets of mate creek energy of w 
va  inc and virginia energy company  and the business of premium energy  inc by merger 
also on october   in connection with our acquisition of the nicewonder coal group  we entered into a new million credit facility consisting of a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility 
we used the net proceeds of the term loan facility and a portion of the proceeds from drawings under the revolving credit facility to finance the nicewonder acquisition and to refinance our million prior credit facility 
progress acquisition on may   we completed the acquisition of certain coal mining operations in eastern kentucky from progress fuels corp  a subsidiary of progress energy  for million  including an adjustment for working capital 
the progress acquisition consisted of the purchase of the outstanding capital stock of diamond may coal co 
and progress land corp 
and the assets of kentucky may coal co  inc the operations acquired are adjacent to alpha s enterprise business unit and have been integrated into enterprise 
gallatin acquisition on december   we paid million and we are obligated to make an additional contribution of million in for a ownership interest in gallatin materials llc gallatin  a lime manufacturing venture near cincinnati  ohio 
gallatin plans to construct two rotary pre heater lime kilns to produce lime to be sold primarily to coal burning utilities as a scrubbing agent for removing sulfur dioxide from flue gas 
the lime is also expected to be sold to steel producers for use as flux in electric arc and basic oxygen furnaces 
the minority owners were granted restricted member interests in gallatin which vest based on performance criteria over approximately three years from the closing date and which  if earned in their entirety  would reduce our ownership to 
we are committed to providing financing to gallatin through a million subordinated loan and provided a million letter of credit to cover cost overruns 
forward purchase and forward sales contracts in the course of preparing our second quarter financial statements  we and our independent auditors identified certain forward purchase and forward sales contracts that considered derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  that did not qualify under the normal purchase and normal sales exception 
transactions that do not qualify for this exception are required to be marked to market 
accordingly we reviewed these contracts to assess the impact  if any  which mark to market adjustments would have had on previously issued financial statements 
upon completion of that review  we concluded that previously issued financial statements were not materially misstated 
at the beginning of the second quarter of  we recorded adjustments to mark to market all of our open contracts for coal sales and purchases in the over the counter market otc and certain third party purchases and sales contracts 
these adjustments resulted in an decrease in coal sales revenues of million and a decrease in cost of coal sales of million  resulting in a net after tax increase to net income in the amount of million 
staff accounting bulletin no 
on september   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab is effective for us for the year ended december  and provided for a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  for errors which were not previously deemed to be material  but which are material under the guidance of sab as a result of the adoption of sab  we changed our method of accounting for costs related to acid mine drainage and also for certain materials and supplies which are used in mining operations 
we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings by million net of income tax effect of million for the combined effect of these accounting changes 

table of contents coal pricing trends  uncertainties and outlook the strong coal pricing environment that has contributed to our growth in revenues during and began to moderate in the second half of due to an increase in customer stockpiles  mild weather and increased coal production which lead to an oversupply of coal in the marketplace 
with utilities adjusting their coal inventories to more normalized levels  and us coal supply outpacing consumption in  the market has softened for steam coal with little indication of when conditions might improve and support price improvements 
met coal markets have been more insulated from significant price movement  and we have contracted most of our met business for  including virtually all domestic business 
met coal sales are expected to account for percent of expected sales volumes 
while our outlook on coal pricing remains positive  future coal prices are subject to factors beyond our control and we cannot predict whether and for how long this current coal pricing environment will continue 
as of february   percent of our planned production was committed and priced and percent was committed and unpriced  with approximately million tons uncommitted 
committed steam coal prices for average to per ton and met coal prices average to per ton 
approximately percent of our planned production in is committed 
we are exercising production discipline during this weaker market period and we are also reviewing all of our projected capital expenditures for in order to prioritize those expenditures in favor of operations that are able to achieve sustainable operating margins in a softer pricing environment 
we have made a number of changes to our operating subsidiaries mine plans which in the aggregate should reduce our annual production going forward by about million tons 
our business is very sensitive to changes in supply and demand and we will be carefully managing our mines in to preserve profit margins 
events beyond our control could impact our profit margins 
during the second half of  we experienced growing productivity challenges due to geology issues related to the high quality  high revenue reserves we choose to mine and the unavailability of experienced labor at certain locations 
as a result  productivity levels declined and costs increased 
additionally  training and integrating new miners takes time and their productivity levels during this period are not equal to that of more experienced miners

our results for were unfavorably impacted by an after tax charge of million for stock based compensation also related to our ipo 
tons sold increased from million tons in to million tons in mainly due to the impact of the nicewonder and progress acquisitions  representing million tons  partially offset by a reduction of million tons of purchased coal sold 
coal margin  which we define as coal revenues less cost of coal sales  divided by coal revenues  increased from in to in revenues year ended december  increase decrease or tons in thousands  except per ton data coal revenues freight and handling revenues other revenues total revenues tons sold coal sales realization per ton sold coal revenues 
coal revenues increased for the year ended december  by million or  to  million  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a per ton increase in the average sales price of our coal and the sale of million additional tons over the comparable period last year 
tons sold increased from million tons in to million tons in mainly due to the addition of the nicewonder and progress acquisitions  representing million tons  partially offset by a reduction of million tons of purchased coal sold 
the mark to market adjustment for certain forward sales contracts increased revenues by million 
the increase in the average sales price of our coal was due to the general increase in coal prices during the period 
met coal prices increased by per ton to per ton and steam coal prices increased by per ton to an average of per ton including the effects of the million payment to terminate a multi year coal contract  which was recorded as a reduction in steam coal revenues 
our sales mix of met coal and steam coal based on volume in was and  respectively compared with and in freight and handling revenues 
freight and handling revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in freight costs  arising primarily from fuel surcharges 
these revenues are offset by equivalent costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
other revenues 
other revenues increased for the year ended december  by million  or  to million  as compared to the same period for revenues from our road construction operations were million  a million increase mainly due to a full year of operations in this increase was mostly offset by a decrease in revenues from outside sales by maxxim rebuild of million  a decrease in fees from coal processing and handling operations of million  net of an increase in rents  royalties and other in the amount of million

for the year ended december   our cost of coal sales  which excludes charges for depreciation  depletion and amortization  increased million  or  to  million compared to the year ended december  the mark to market adjustment on certain forward purchase contracts increased cost of coal sales by million 
approximately million of the year ended december  increase in costs were associated with our nicewonder and progress acquisitions  partially offset by a reduction in spending for purchased coal of million 
in addition  our cost of coal sales increased as a result of increased prices for labor  diesel fuel and other mine supplies  the performance and cost of contract mining services  and increased variable sales related costs  such as royalties and severance taxes 
the average cost per ton sold increased from per ton in to per ton in our cost of coal sales as a percentage of coal revenues decreased from in to in for the years ended december  and our average cost per ton for our produced and processed coal sales was and  respectively  and our average cost per ton for coal that we purchased from third parties and resold without processing was and  respectively 
freight and handling costs 
freight and handling costs increased million to million during as compared to due to an increase in freight costs  arising primarily from fuel surcharges 
these costs were offset by an equivalent amount of freight and handling revenue

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation charges 
stock based compensation charges included in sg a totaled million and million in and  respectively 
stock based compensation charges in the amount of and million in and  respectively  are related to our ipo 
these charges ended at december  this decrease was mostly offset by an increase in wages and benefits in the amount of million driven by a increase in administrative personnel and the additional expense related to our key employee retention plan and an increase in professional fees million related to being a public company 
our sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in 
table of contents interest expense interest expense increased million to million due to an increase in our average amount of debt outstanding in related to nicewonder acquisition and a general increase in interest rates 
interest income interest income decreased million to million 
this decrease is due to the reduction in the average amount outstanding on an interest bearing note receivable from a coal supplier mostly offset by additional interest earned on invested cash 
income tax expense benefit income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax expense from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rates for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for was lower than the statutory federal tax rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  the additional tax benefits associated with percentage depletion  and the extraterritorial income exclusion partially offset by non deductible stock based compensation charges associated with the ipo and state income taxes 
since our formation and through the third quarter of  we did not weigh significantly our forecast of future taxable income subjective evidence as we had not yet established an adequate earnings history defined by us as at least three years to provide objective evidence of the ability to generate future income 
accordingly  we had recorded a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have a three year history of cumulative earnings 
as a result  we believe we are able to place a higher degree of reliance on our projections of future taxable income 
based on the results of a comprehensive analysis completed in the fourth quarter of  we have concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of it s deferred tax asset previously reserved through a valuation allowance will be realized 
as a result  we recorded a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of million 
excluding this reversal of the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate would have been approximately for the effective tax rate for is higher than the statutory federal tax rate due primarily to the portion of the stock based compensation charge associated with the issuance of common stock to management in connection with the internal restructuring and initial public offering that is not deductible for tax purposes 
to a much lesser extent  state income taxes contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate above the statutory rate 
the increase in expected income tax expense related to the stock based compensation charge and state income taxes is offset in part by the tax benefits associated with percentage depletion  the extraterritorial income exclusion  a reduction in valuation allowance of million  and the effect of not providing taxes on the minority interest and pass through entity prior to the internal restructuring

table of contents coal revenues 
coal revenues increased for the year ended december  by million or  to  million  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was due to a per ton increase in the average sales price of our coal and the sale of million additional tons over the comparable period 
the acquisition of the nicewonder coal group accounted for almost one half of the increase in tons sold 
the increase in the average sales price of our coal was due to the general increase in coal prices during the period and to our ability to take advantage of the exceptionally high metallurgical coal met coal sale prices by processing and marketing as met coal some coal qualities that would traditionally have been marketed as steam coal 
met coal prices increased by per ton to per ton as steam coal prices increased by per ton to an average of per ton

when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
analysis of material debt covenants we were in compliance with all covenants under our current credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes as of december  the financial covenants in our current credit facility require  among other things  that alpha nr holding inc must maintain a leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated adjusted debt consolidated debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to adjusted ebitda as defined in the new credit agreement  of not more than at december   march  june  september and december   at march  june  september and december   and at march  and each quarter end thereafter  with adjusted ebitda being computed using the most recent four quarters  and alpha nr holding inc must maintain an interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense  of or greater on the last day of any fiscal quarter 
based upon adjusted ebitda as defined in our current credit agreement  alpha nr holding inc s leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as such ratios are defined in the credit agreement at december  were and  respectively 
adjusted ebitda is used in our current credit facility to determine compliance with many of the covenants under the facility 
a breach of the covenants in the credit facility that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda could result in a default under the credit facility and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any acceleration under our credit facility would also result in a default under our indenture 
adjusted ebitda is defined in our current credit facility as ebitda  further adjusted to exclude non recurring items  non cash items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit facility  as shown in the table below 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financial covenants

contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total long term debt and capital leases equipment purchase commitments operating leases minimum royalties coal purchase commitments gallatin commitments coal contract buyout total long term debt and capital leases include principal amounts due in the years shown 
interest payable on these obligations  with interest rates ranging between and on our loans and capital leases  would be approximately million in  million in to  million in to  and million after 
table of contents additionally  we have long term liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  workers compensation and black lung benefits and postretirement benefits 
the table below reflects the estimated payments for these obligations in thousands within year years years after years total asset retirement obligation postretirement workers compensation benefits and black lung benefits total off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time  we provide guarantees to financial institutions to facilitate the acquisition of mining equipment by third parties who mine coal for us 
this arrangement is beneficial to us because it helps insure a continuing source of coal production 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations such as mine closure and reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation  coal leases and other obligations 
we typically secure these payment obligations by using surety bonds  an off balance sheet instrument 
the use of surety bonds is less expensive for us than the alternative of posting a cash bond or a bank letter of credit  either of which would require a greater use of our credit facility 
we then use bank letters of credit to secure our surety bonding obligations as a lower cost alternative than securing those bonds with cash 
under our million committed bonding facility  we are required to provide bank letters of credit in an amount up to of the aggregate bond liability 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we have a committed bonding facility with travelers casualty and surety company of america  pursuant to which travelers has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we also entered into a committed bonding facility with the chubb group of insurance companies 
chubb has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to issue surety bonds on our behalf in a maximum amount of million 
as of december   we have posted an aggregate of million in reclamation bonds and million of other types of bonds under these facilities 
we maintained letters of credit as of december  totaling million to secure reclamation and other surety bond obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
reclamation 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at deep mines 
we account for the costs of our reclamation activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates  and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below 
table of contents discount rate 
sfas no 
requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded at fair value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
sfas no 
requires the measurement of an obligation to be based upon the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 

table of contents on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately million 
coal reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists and reviewed by a third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
postretirement medical benefits 
we have long term liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefit costs 
the discount rate assumption is determined from a published yield curve table matched to the timing of our projected cash out flows 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than pensions was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injury and illness obligations 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our requirement to satisfy these or additional obligations 
below we have provided two sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
health care cost trend rate dollars in thousands one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation discount rate dollars in thousands one half percentage point increase one half percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
table of contents we recorded an additional liability of million  net of tax as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that any unfunded portion of the accumulated pension benefit obligation apbo be  recognized on the balance sheet as additional liabilities 
workers compensation 
workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of a self insurance program and an insurance policy 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarial studies 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
coal workers pneumoconiosis 
we are required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
these claims are covered by a third party insurance provider in all locations where we operate with the exception of west virginia 
the company is self insured for state black lung related claims at certain locations in west virginia 
we account for black lung benefits under the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefit other than pension  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
charges are made to operations for state black lung claims in west virginia  as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee s applicable term of service 
effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fasb  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that we recognize on its balance sheet the amount of the company s unfunded accumulated benefit obligation abo at the end of the year 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we analyze both positive and negative evidence as required by sfas no 
such evidence includes objective evidence obtained from our historical earnings  future sales commitments  outlooks on the coal industry by us and third parties  expected level of future earnings with sensitivities on expectations considered  timing of temporary difference reversals  ability or inability to meet forecasted earnings  unsettled industry circumstances  ability to carry back and utilize a future tax loss if a loss were to occur  available tax planning strategies  limitations on deductibility of temporary differences  and the impact the alternative minimum tax has on utilization of deferred tax assets 
as further described in note  we reported three consecutive years of positive earnings history in the fourth quarter of this objective evidence  coupled with a review of the aforementioned areas in the fourth quarter  resulted in our recording of a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is monitored and reviewed quarterly 
if our conclusions change in the future regarding the realization of a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas no

discussion of seasonality impacts on operations our business is seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we have historically experienced lower sales during winter months primarily due to the freezing of lakes that we use to transport coal to some of our customers 
as a result  our first quarter cash flow and profits have been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted 
lower than expected sales by us during this period could have a material adverse effect on the timing of our cash flows and therefore our ability to service our obligations with respect to our existing and future indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to market risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing coal and diesel fuel prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling coal 
as of february   less than and of our estimated and expected production  respectively  was uncommitted 
as compared to prior years  we have increased the proportion of our planned future production in and for which we have contracts to sell coal  which has the effect of reducing our market price risk 
we use significant quantities of diesel fuel in our operations and are also exposed to risk in the market price for diesel fuel 
we have entered into a forward physical purchase contract and diesel fuel swap agreement to reduce the volatility in the price of diesel fuel for our operations 
the diesel fuel swap agreement is not designated as a hedge and therefore the changes in the fair value for this derivative instrument contract is required to be recorded in cost of sales 
as of december  approximately million gallons or percent of the company s anticipated fuel usage has been fixed with the physical purchase and swap agreements 
included in the million gallons is the physical purchase of million gallons at per gallon for the first six months of and the notional amount of million gallons at per gallon for the last six months of 
table of contents we purchase coal in the otc market and directly from third parties to supplement and blend with our produced and processed coal in order to provide coal of the quality and quantity to meet certain of our customer s requirements 
we also sell in the otc market to fix the price of uncommitted future production from our mines 
certain of these purchase and sale contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument 
any derivative instruments that we hold are held for purposes other than trading 
our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purpose 
the use of purchase and sales contracts which are considered derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations as a result of the requirement to mark them to market at the end of each reporting period 
however  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations because these transactions account for only a small portion of our business 
these transactions give rise to commodity price risk  which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the price of coal 
outstanding purchase and sales contracts at december  that are considered derivative instruments are summarized as follows purchase contracts purchase price range tons outstanding delivery period mark to market adjustment in millions sales contracts selling price range tons outstanding delivery period mark to market adjustment in millions interest rate risk all of our borrowings under our new citicorp credit facility are at a variable rate  exposing us to the effect of rising interest rates in the united states 
as of december   we have a million term loan outstanding with a variable interest rate based upon the month london interbank offered rate libor at december  plus an applicable margin at december  
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  effective may  we entered into a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap on the notional amount of million for a period of approximately six and one half years 
in effect  this swap converted the variable interest rates based on the libor to a fixed interest rate of plus the applicable margin defined in the debt agreement  at december  for a portion of our term loan 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase in interest expense of approximately million based on our variable rate borrowing as of december  in excess of the notional amount of the interest rate swap of million at december  we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in fair value of the swap are recorded to other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of the swap at year end december  was a liability of million million net of tax
