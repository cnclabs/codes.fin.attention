item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes attached as appendix a to this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report 
executive summary overview we offer our clients  national and regional financial institutions and educational institutions  as well as businesses  education loan marketers and other organizations  a suite of outsourcing services for private education lending in the united states 
we currently focus on facilitating private student loans for undergraduate  graduate and professional education  although we also provide service offerings for continuing education programs  the primary and secondary school market  career training and study abroad programs 
we provide services in connection with each of the five typical phases of the student loan lifecycle  offering our clients a single point of interface for program design and marketing coordination  borrower inquiry and application  loan origination and disbursement  loan securitization  and loan servicing 
we receive fees for the services we provide in connection with our clients private student loans  including processing and structuring and administering securitizations of those loans 
securitization refers to the technique of pooling loans and selling them to a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity  typically a trust  which issues securities to investors backed by those loans 
we have provided structural  advisory and other services for securitization transactions since our formation in we do not take a direct ownership interest in the student loans our clients generate  nor do we serve as a guarantor with respect to any student loan programs that we facilitate 
we assist the lenders in our loan programs in selecting the underwriting criteria used in deciding whether a student loan will be made to an applicant 
however  each lender has ultimate control over the selection of these criteria  and in providing our services  we are obligated by contract to observe them 
our lender clients have the opportunity to mitigate their credit risk through a loan repayment guarantee by teri pursuant to which teri guarantees repayment of the borrower s loan principal  together with capitalized or accrued interest  on defaulted loans 
lenders that wish to have their loans guaranteed by teri are required to meet teri s underwriting criteria 
beginning in april  our wholly owned subsidiary union federal  began serving as an additional lender for our proprietary brand of private student loans 
although we oversee loan servicing as a component of our administrative duties  we do not act as a loan servicer 
the primary driver of our results of operations and financial condition is the volume of student loans for which we provide outsourcing services from loan origination through securitization 
the following table presents certain financial and operating information for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands approximate student loan applications processed approximate number of student loans facilitated approximate number of student loans facilitated that were also available to us for securitization principal amount of student loans facilitated principal amount of student loans facilitated that were also available to us for securitization principal and accrued interest balance of student loans securitized principal balance of student loans facilitated and available to us at year end for later securitization the principal balance of loans facilitated and available to us for later securitization fluctuates as a result of several factors including a the timing of securitizations  b the cut off date for loan purchases as securitizations take place  c the loan purchase eligibility criteria included in the various note purchase agreements that govern the purchase of loans for securitization and d the daily volume of loans facilitated prior to period end 
in june  we acquired teri s loan processing operations  including its historical database  but not its investment assets or guarantee liabilities 
in connection with this acquisition  we entered into a master servicing agreement pursuant to which teri engages us to provide loan origination and processing services with respect to the student loans generated through the private label programs we facilitate  as well as other teri guaranteed loans 
teri reimburses us for the expenses we incur in providing these services 
under the terms of a master loan guaranty agreement that we have entered into with teri  we have also agreed to provide a beneficial interest for teri in a portion of the residual value of securitization trusts that purchase teri guaranteed loans  and granted to teri a right of first refusal to provide a third party guarantee of our private label clients existing and future loan programs 
in october  we renewed our master servicing agreement  master loan guaranty agreement and certain additional agreements with teri  in each case for an additional term through june although we offer our clients a fully integrated suite of outsourcing services  we do not charge separate fees for many of these services 
moreover  although we receive fees for providing loan processing services to teri in connection with teri guaranteed loans  and fees from certain of our clients for marketing coordination services  these fees represent reimbursement of the direct expenses we incur 
accordingly  we do not earn a profit on these fees 
although we provide these various services without charging a separate fee  or at cost in the case of processing services for teri guaranteed loans and marketing coordination services  we generally enter into agreements with the private label lenders giving us the exclusive right to securitize the student loans that they do not intend to hold 
we receive structural advisory fees and residuals for facilitating securitizations of these loans 
our level of profitability depends on our ability to earn these structural advisory fees and residuals 
we discuss the manner in which we recognize them as revenue in greater detail below 
we may in the future enter into arrangements with private label lenders under which we would provide outsourcing services  but would not have the exclusive right to securitize the student loans that they originate 
changes in any of the following factors can materially affect our financial results the demand for private education financing  the competition for providing private education financing  the education financing preferences of students and their families  applicable laws and regulations  which may affect the terms upon which our clients agree to make private student loans and the cost and complexity of our loan facilitation operations  the private student loan securitization market  including the costs or availability of financing and market receptivity to triple b rated student loan asset backed notes and auction rate notes  the general interest rate environment  including its effect on our discount and prepayment rates  our critical accounting policies and estimates  borrower default rates and our ability to recover principal and interest from such borrowers  prepayment rates  including prepayments through loan consolidation of private student loans held by our trusts  and the availability of student loans or grants through federal programs 
on november   we completed the acquisition of union federal  a community savings bank located in north providence  rhode island 
union federal is a federally chartered thrift that offers residential retail mortgage loans  retail savings products  time deposit products and  as of april  private student loans 
union federal had total assets of approximately million as of the acquisition date 
the financial results of union federal subsequent to the acquisition date are included in our financial statements 
the purchase price was allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based on their respective fair values at november  we recorded additional goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of million as a result of this acquisition 
goodwill will be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the core deposit intangible represented the present value of the difference in expected future cash flows between the costs to replace such deposits based on applicable equivalent borrowing rates versus the then current yield on core deposits acquired 
the aggregate future cash flows are based on the average expected life of the deposits acquired for each product less the cost to service them 
the core deposit intangible will be amortized on a straight line basis over a five year period and will be reviewed for impairment when it is determined that facts or circumstances may affect the recoverability of the asset 
securitizations and related revenue we structure and facilitate securitization transactions for our clients through a series of bankruptcy remote  qualified special purpose statutory trusts 
the trusts obtain through the securitization process private student loans from the originating lenders or their assignees  which relinquish to the trust their ownership interest in the loans 
the debt instruments that the trusts issue to finance the purchase of these student loans are obligations of the trusts  rather than our obligations or those of originating lenders or their assignees 
we refer to the trusts utilized in the securitization of teri guaranteed private label loans as private label loan trusts 
under the terms of some of our contracts with key lender clients  we have an obligation to securitize periodically the private student loans that these clients originate 
if we do not honor our obligations to these lenders  we may be required to pay liquidated damages  generally not exceeding an amount equal to of the face amount of the loans available for securitization 
we receive several types of fees in connection with our securitization services structural advisory fees 
we charge structural advisory fees that are paid in two portions up front 
we receive a portion of the structural advisory fees at the time the securitization trust purchases the loans  or shortly thereafter 
in exchange for these fees  we structure the debt securities sold in the securitization  coordinate the attorneys  accountants  trustees  loan servicers  loan originators and other transaction participants and prepare the cash flow modeling for rating agencies as needed 
for the securitizations of teri guaranteed loans that we facilitated in fiscal  these fees ranged from to of the aggregate principal and capitalized interest of the loans securitized 
for the securitizations of teri guaranteed loans we facilitated in fiscal  these fees ranged from to of the aggregate principal and capitalized interest of the loans securitized 
the private label loan trusts we facilitated in fiscal issued triple b rated securities  the only such issuances by any of our securitizations trusts 
the issuance of triple b rated securities enabled us to increase the up front structural advisory fee yield  with a decrease in the amount of residuals we expect to receive  from these securitization transactions  and additional 
we receive a portion of the structural advisory fees over time  based on the amount of loans outstanding in the private label loan trust from time to time over the life of the trust 
this portion accumulates monthly from the date of a securitization transaction at a rate of to basis points per year 
we begin to receive this additional portion  plus interest  once the ratio of trust assets to trust liabilities  which we refer to as the parity ratio  reaches a stipulated level  which ranges from to 
the level applicable to a particular private label loan trust is determined at the time of securitization 
we currently expect to receive the additional fees beginning five to seven years after the date of a particular securitization transaction 
residual 
we also have the right to receive a portion of the residual interests that these private label loan trusts create 
this interest is junior in priority to the rights of the holders of the debt sold in the securitizations and additional structural advisory fees  and entitles us to receive to of the net cash flows of the particular private label loan trust once a parity ratio of to  depending on the particular trust  is reached and maintained 
our residual interest derives almost exclusively from the services we perform in connection with each securitization rather than from a direct cash contribution to the securitization trust 
in the case of securitizations of exclusively private label loans  we currently expect to receive the residuals beginning approximately five to seven years after the date of a particular securitization 
administrative and other fees 
our administrative and other fees represent the reimbursement of out of pocket costs we receive at the time of securitization related to marketing coordination services performed for some of our clients 
our administrative and other fees also include the administrative fees we receive from the trusts for their daily management and services we provide in obtaining information from the loan servicers and reporting this and other information to the parties related to the securitization 
our fees for performing these services range from to basis points per year based on the student loan balance in the trust 
processing fees from teri we provide outsourcing services for teri  including loan origination  customer service  default processing  default prevention and administrative services under a master servicing agreement between teri and us 
we recognize as revenue the monthly reimbursement that teri provides us for the expenses we incur in providing these services 
recognition and valuation of service revenue we recognize up front structural advisory fees as revenue at the time the securitization trust purchases the loans 
in order for the securitization trust to purchase the loans  all of the applicable services must be performed  rating agencies must deliver their ratings letters  transaction counsel must deliver the required legal opinions and the underwriters must receive the debt securities issued by the securitization trust 
these events indicate that the securitization transaction has been properly structured and loans have been properly sold to the securitization trust 
as required under gaap  we also recognize the fair value of additional structural advisory fees and residuals as revenue at that time  as they are deemed to be earned at the time of the securitization but before we actually receive payment 
these amounts are deemed earned because evidence of an arrangement exists  we have provided the services  the fee is fixed and determinable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  there are no future contingencies or obligations and collection is reasonably assured 
under gaap  we are required to estimate the fair value of the additional structural advisory fees and residuals as if they are investments in debt securities classified as available for sale or trading  similar to retained interests in securitizations 
accordingly  we record additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivable on our balance sheet at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model 
because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivable  we use certain key assumptions to estimate their values 
see application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables 
we estimate the fair value both initially and at each subsequent quarter and reflect the change in the value in earnings for that period 
we generally recognize administrative and other fees  as well as processing fees from teri  as revenue at the time that we perform the underlying services 
we recognize marketing coordination fees  which are a component of administrative and other fees  at the time the securitization trust purchases the loans derived from the related marketing coordination services 
quarterly fluctuations our quarterly revenue  operating results and profitability have varied and may continue to vary on a quarterly basis primarily because of the timing  size and structure of the securitizations that we facilitate 
in fiscal  we facilitated one securitization in each of the first  second and third quarters and two securitizations in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  we facilitated one securitization in the second quarter  one securitization in the third quarter and two securitizations in the fourth quarter 
we expect to facilitate securitizations in each quarter of fiscal  although the timing  size or structure of any capital markets transactions could be affected by recent volatility in the capital markets 
variations in the size or structure of each securitization transaction could continue to result in variability of our operating results on a quarterly basis 
the following tables set forth our quarterly revenue and net income loss for each quarter of fiscal and fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands total revenues net income fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands total revenues net income loss application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   which are attached as appendix a to this document 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to the recognition and valuation of our securitization related revenue and receivables  as described below  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
we also consider our policy with respect to the determination of whether or not to consolidate the financial results of the securitization trusts that we facilitate to be a critical accounting policy 
service revenue and receivables for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies  see recognition and valuation of service revenue 
because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees or residuals receivable  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and the following key assumptions to estimate their values the discount rate  which we use to calculate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals  the annual rate of student loan prepayments  the trend of interest rates over the life of the loan pool  including the forward libor curve  and the spread between libor and auction rates  expected loan defaults  and expected recoveries of defaulted loans 
we base these estimates on our proprietary historical data  third party data and our industry experience  adjusting for specific program and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
we also monitor trends in loan performance over time and make adjustments we believe are necessary to value properly our receivables balances at each balance sheet date 
the following table shows the approximate weighted average loan performance assumptions at june  for our private label loan trusts percentage rate percentage discount rate trust default recovery prepayments residuals structural advisory fees private label loan trusts in selecting loan performance assumptions  we consider the underlying creditworthiness of the student loan borrowers as well as the type of loans being securitized 
we analyze creditworthiness in several tiers  and select what we believe to be appropriate loan performance assumptions based on those tiers 
our private label loan programs  under which approximately of the borrowers have creditworthy co borrowers  typically a family member  have an extensive credit underwriting process 
prepayment rates 
loans in the securitization trusts have been experiencing higher prepayment rates than we had estimated would occur at these points in the life of the trusts as a result of a number of factors  including a prolonged and unfavorable interest rate environment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we altered our assumption regarding the annual rate of prepayments that we use to estimate the fair value of our residual and structural advisory fee receivables 
the increase of this assumption from an average over the life of the trusts of to resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the residual receivable of million and a decrease in the fair value of the additional structural advisory fee receivable of million during the third quarter of fiscal discount rate residuals 
in determining an appropriate discount rate for valuing our residuals  we historically have reviewed the rates used by student loan securitizers as well as rates used in the much broader asset backed securities  or abs  market 
prior to fiscal  we applied a discount rate of in estimating the present value of our residuals  based on the expected timing of cash flows and the maximum year life of the trust assets and residuals 
during fiscal  we facilitated four securitization transactions involving the issuance of triple b rated securities  the only such issuances by any of our securitization trusts 
triple b rated issuances have  in effect  allowed us to monetize a portion of our securitization related revenues that previously would have been recognized as residuals 
accordingly  we believe that market developments have now provided us with a meaningful basis for the discount rate to be applied in estimating the fair value of pre fiscal private label securitization trust residuals 
beginning with the third quarter of fiscal  we applied a discount rate equal to the trailing month average of the one month libor to value the portion of the residuals that we believe qualifies as investment grade in pre fiscal private label trusts 
that portion of the residuals that we believe does not qualify as investment grade is discounted at  as it is in the securitization trusts that have issued triple b rated securities 
the decrease in the aggregated average discount rate in the third quarter of fiscal resulted in an increase in the fair value of our residual receivable of million 
discount rate additional structural advisory fees 
we base the discount rate that we use to calculate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees on the year us treasury note rate plus basis points 
we believe that such a spread is an appropriate discount rate based on the priority payment status of additional structural advisory fees in the flow of funds out of the securitization trusts and comparable spreads on structural and corporate debt securities 
during fiscal and  the year us treasury note rate decreased basis points 
we applied a discount rate of at june  and at june  a decrease in the year us treasury note rate has the effect of increasing the estimated fair value of our structural advisory fees receivable  while an increase in the rate has the opposite effect on our estimate of fair value 
two private label loan trusts have issued predominately senior auction rate notes to finance the purchase of student loans 
interest rates for the auction rate notes are determined from time to time at auction 
at june   we used a basis point spread over libor to project the future cost of funding of the senior auction rate notes issued by the trusts 
since inception of the first trust  the average spread over libor for the senior auction rate notes issued by the trust has been basis points 
since the inception of the second trust  the average spread over libor for the senior auction rate notes issued by the trust has been basis points 
except for the changes to the prepayment rate and the discount rates applied to residuals and additional structural advisory fees  we did not materially change any valuation assumptions during fiscal or during the second quarter of fiscal  we increased our estimate of the fair value of structural advisory fees by approximately million and increased our estimate of the fair value of residuals receivable by approximately million as a result of refinements to our prepayment rate assumptions and the use of an enhanced cash flow model 
we will continue to monitor the performance of the trust assets against our expectations  and will make such adjustments to our estimates as we believe are necessary to value properly our receivables balances at each balance sheet date 
sensitivity analysis increases in our estimates of defaults  prepayments and discount rates  increases in the spread between libor and auction rates indices  as well as decreases in default recovery rates and the multi year forward estimates of libor  would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals 
student loan prepayments include either full or partial payments by a borrower in advance of the maturity schedule specified in the credit agreement  including payments as a result of loan consolidation activity 
because most credit defaults are reimbursable by third parties  increases in defaults generally have the same effect as increases in prepayments 
if defaults increase beyond the level of expected third party reimbursement  then these changes will have an additional negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals 
libor is the reference rate for a substantial majority of the loan assets and  we believe  a reasonable index for borrowings of the trusts 
because the trusts student loan assets earn interest based on libor and some trusts have outstanding securities that pay interest based on the results of auction rates  changes in the spread between libor and the auction rate can affect the performance of the trusts which have issued auction rate notes 
the following table shows the estimated change in our structural advisory fees and residuals receivable balances at june  based on changes in our loan performance assumptions 
the effect on the fair value of the structural advisory fees and residuals receivables are based on variations of or  except for the forward libor rates  which are based on variations of and from the forward libor rates at june   and changes in the assumed spread between month libor rates and auction rates  which are based on

the effect of each change in assumption must be calculated independently  holding all other assumptions constant 
because the key assumptions may not in fact be independent  the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in key assumptions may differ materially from the sum of the individual effects calculated above 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the first marblehead corporation and its subsidiaries  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions 
we have not consolidated the financial results of the securitization trusts purchasing loans that we have facilitated 
prior to july   this accounting treatment was in accordance with various emerging issues task force issues and related interpretations 
we considered  among other things  the following factors in assessing consolidation of the securitization trusts we did not have unilateral decision making abilities related to significant matters affecting the securitization trusts  such as asset acquisition  prepayment of debt  placement of debt obligations and modification of trust documents  we did not have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  as teri provides substantially all of the student loan guarantees  we were a facilitator of securitization transactions  for which we receive market based fees  and we were not the transferor of assets to the securitization trusts  and our continuing involvement in the trusts is limited to a passive residual interest and our role as an administrator for the trust for which we receive market based fees 
beginning july   and for securitization trusts created after january   we applied financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin no 
 in assessing consolidation 
fin no 
provided a new framework for identifying variable interest entities and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of activities of a variable interest entity in its consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued fin no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin no 
r  which addressed how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin no 
r has replaced fin no 
at june   each securitization trust created after january  has met the criteria to be a qualified special purpose entity  or qspe  as defined in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  we did not consolidate these existing securitization trusts in our financial statements 
in addition  the securitization trusts created prior to january  in which we hold a variable interest that could result in us being considered the primary beneficiary of such trust  have been amended in order for them to be considered qspes 
the adoption of fin no 
r  which we began to apply in december  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  earnings per share or cash flows 
the fasb has issued an exposure draft that would amend fasb statement no 
the proposed amendment would  among other things  change the requirements that an entity must meet to be considered a qspe 
we are monitoring the status of the exposure draft to assess its impact  if any  on our financial statements 
results of operations years ended june   june  and june  revenue related to securitization transactions we primarily offer services in connection with private label loan products offered through two marketing channels a direct to consumer  which generally refers to programs that lenders market directly to prospective borrowers and their families  and b school channel  which refers to programs that lenders market indirectly to student borrowers and their families through educational institutions 
in either case  lenders may engage third parties that are not themselves lenders but which market loans on behalf of lenders that fund the loans 
we refer to these third parties as loan marketers  and we refer to the lenders that fund these loans as program lenders 
our estimates of the allocation by marketing channel of our securitization revenues for fiscal  and  expressed as a percentage of the total principal and accrued interest of private label loans securitized in each channel at the date of securitization  are as follows percentage yield month and year of private label securitization marketing channel volume of loans securitized up front structural advisory fees additional structural advisory fees residuals total dollars in millions june direct to consumer school channel total blended yield march direct to consumer school channel total blended yield december direct to consumer school channel total blended yield september direct to consumer school channel total blended yield fiscal blended yield june direct to consumer school channel total blended yield march direct to consumer school channel total blended yield october direct to consumer school channel total blended yield fiscal blended yield june direct to consumer school channel total blended yield june school channel february direct to consumer school channel total blended yield october direct to consumer school channel total blended yield fiscal blended yield blended yield represents securitization revenues as a percentage of the total principal and accrued interest balance of the loans securitized from all marketing channels at the date of securitization 
due to rounding and the complex nature of these calculations  which involve allocating the total revenue for a securitization across the different marketing channels based on the aggregate profitability of each marketing channel  the total yield by marketing channel and securitization may not represent the sum of the individual yields by revenue source 
these yields by marketing channel represent an approximate allocation of revenues and costs based on various estimates and assumptions regarding the relative profitability of these loans  and should be read with caution 
furthermore  these yields are dependent on a number of factors  including the mix of loans between marketing channels that are included in a particular securitization  the average life of loans  which can be impacted by prepayments  the time of year that the loans are securitized and the relative mix of loans from students with various expected terms to graduation  the structure of  and prevailing market conditions at the time of  a securitization  the marketing fees which our clients earn on loans we securitize for them  along with a number of other factors 
therefore  readers are cautioned that the approximated blended yields and yields by marketing channel above may not be indicative of yields that we may be able to achieve in future securitizations 
up front structural advisory fees the up front component of structural advisory fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in up front structural advisory fees between periods was primarily due to an increase in up front structural advisory fees as a percentage of the private label loan volume securitized  or up front structural advisory fee yield  and an increase in loan facilitation volume  which enabled us to securitize a greater amount of loans 
the securitization trusts we facilitated in fiscal issued triple b rated securities  the only such issuances by any of our securitization trusts 
the issuance of triple b rated securities enabled us to increase during fiscal the up front structural advisory fee yield  with a decrease in the amount of residuals we expect to receive  from these securitization transactions 
the increase in up front structural advisory fees for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in loan facilitation volume and  to a lesser extent  an increase in up front structural advisory fee yield resulting from an increased balance of student loans securitized  a change in the mix of student loans securitized and the introduction of new securitization features 
the following table reflects the changes in up front structural advisory fees attributable to the changes in securitization volume  changes in the fee yield and loan mix  and the receipt of cost of issuance funds for fiscal  and up front structural advisory fees fiscal year total volume of loans securitized change attributable to increase securitization volume change attributable to change in fee yield and loan mix receipt of cost of issuance funds total change in thousands the receipt of cost of issuance funds represents the receipt of remaining funds in a trust s cost of issuance account once the trust has paid all costs associated with its issuance of asset backed securities 
additional structural advisory fees the additional component of structural advisory fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in additional structural advisory fees between periods was primarily due to increases in the aggregate securitization volume 
the increase in additional structural advisory fees for fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase in our prepayment assumption

in doing so  we give effect to the passage of time  which results in the accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates  and we also adjust for any change in the discount rate and other assumptions that we use in estimating the fair value of these receivables 
we monitor the performance of trust assets  including default  recovery  prepayment and forward libor rate experience  which we also consider in our estimates 
we use an implied forward libor curve to estimate trust cash flows 
for a discussion of the assumptions we make in estimating our additional structural advisory fees  see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables 
during fiscal  our estimates of the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees resulted in an increase in their carrying value of approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to the accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates  offset in part by the impact of an increase in our assumption regarding future prepayments that we use to estimate the fair value of this receivable and the effect of higher prepayment rates than we had estimated would occur during the period 
during fiscal  our estimates of the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees resulted in an increase in their carrying value of approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to the accretion of discounting inherent in the fair value estimates and the impact of an increase in the implied forward libor curve during the period  offset by an increase in the discount rate 
for a discussion of changes we made during fiscal to certain assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable  see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables 
residuals service revenues from residuals increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in service revenues from residuals in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in securitization volume  the positive impact of accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates due to the passage of time and a decrease in the discount rate assumption we use to value the residual receivable for certain securitization trusts  offset in part by the impact of a higher up front structural advisory fee yield in the fiscal period and an increase in our assumption for future prepayments that we use to value the residual receivable 
the issuance of triple b rated securities in the securitizations completed during fiscal enabled us to increase the up front structural advisory fee yield  but decreased the amount of residuals we expect to receive  from these securitizations 
the increase in service revenues from residuals in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in securitization volume and an increase in the residual yield

in doing so  we give effect to the passage of time  which results in the accretion of the discounting inherent in these fair value estimates  and we also adjust for any change in the discount rate or other assumptions that we use in estimating the fair value of these receivables 
we used a discount rate during the first six months of fiscal and throughout fiscal in valuing residuals for securitizations completed prior to fiscal as a result of our triple b financing structure  we used a discount rate in valuing residuals for the securitizations completed in fiscal we also monitor the performance of trust assets  including default  recovery  prepayment and forward libor rates experience  which we also consider in our estimates 
we use an implied forward libor curve to estimate trust cash flows 
for a discussion of the assumptions we make in estimating our residuals  see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables 
loans in the securitization trusts have been experiencing higher prepayment rates than we had estimated would occur at these points in the life of the trusts 
as a result  during the third quarter of fiscal  we increased our prepayment assumption from an average over the life of the loan of to  which offset the positive net accretion that comes from updating the carrying value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivables for the passage of time 
the negative effect of the increase in our prepayment rate assumptions was offset in part by a reduction in the discount rates we use to estimate the fair value of a portion of our residuals receivable 
our estimates of the fair value of our residuals receivable resulted in an increase in their aggregate carrying value of approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal during fiscal  the positive impact of the passage of time and the decrease in our discount rate assumption was partially offset by the net negative impact of changes to the prepayment assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of this receivable as well as the negative impact of other factors  including the negative impact of a higher rate of prepayments during the period than we had estimated would occur 
during fiscal  the increase in the fair value of our residual receivable was primarily due to the passage of time 
we believe that the discount rate we used for fiscal securitization trusts for cash flows lower in priority to those received by holders of triple b rated securities or which we believe would not qualify as investment grade for pre fiscal private label trusts is appropriate given the maximum year life of the trust assets and residuals 
for a discussion of changes we made during fiscal to certain assumptions  see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates sensitivity analysis 
processing fees from teri processing fees from teri increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased reimbursable expenses required to process the increased volume of private label loans that we actively disbursed during fiscal the volume of private label loans we actively disbursed increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal administrative and other fees administrative and other fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increases were primarily due to increased reimbursed expenses that we generated between periods from marketing coordination services provided to some of our clients as well as to our proprietary brand 
to a lesser extent  the increase was also due to increasing student loan balances in the securitization trusts during fiscal compared to the fiscal and periods 
we generated approximately million in reimbursable expenses from marketing coordination services in fiscal  compared to approximately million in reimbursable expenses from marketing coordination services in fiscal we did not generate any fees from marketing coordination services in fiscal we earned administrative fees for the daily management of the securitization trusts of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net interest income net interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increases in net interest income in the fiscal  and periods were due primarily to higher average cash balances available for investment  higher average yields and  in fiscal  the net interest income from union federal 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal compensation and benefits increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to an increase in accruals related to our employee incentive compensation plans  primarily as a result of our positive financial results in fiscal the increase in compensation and benefits expense is also the result of an increase in personnel 
our average total number of employees during fiscal was higher than our average number of employees during fiscal we hired additional personnel during fiscal to meet the needs of our growing loan processing and securitization activities 
our average total number of employees during fiscal was higher than our average number of employees during fiscal during fiscal  we outsourced some customer service  loan facilitation and operations functions  resulting in a reduction in headcount for those areas  which was offset by an increase in headcount in information technology personnel 
the increase in the number of information technology employees contributed to an overall increase in compensation and benefits expense in fiscal we hired additional personnel to meet the operating and information systems requirements from our growing loan processing and securitization activities 
general and administrative expenses also increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal as a result of increases in several categories of expenses 
marketing coordination expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in marketing coordination expense was primarily due to the expansion of our marketing coordination services to a larger client base as well as the testing of our proprietary brands 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the expansion of our loan processing operations which resulted in additional purchases of fixed assets as well as the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
equipment expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in equipment expenses was primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and license costs 
temporary employment services costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal external call center costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increases in temporary employment services expense and external call center costs were primarily due to increases in personnel necessary to process the increasing volume of loans facilitated between periods and the expansion of our marketing expenses in the television medium that need call center support 
consulting fees were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the changes between periods were primarily due to fluctuations in external consulting costs used in the evaluation and improvement of our loan facilitation systems 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we devote additional resources to marketing coordination services and the expected increasing loan volumes facilitated for our existing and new clients 
income tax expense income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of income before income tax expense between periods 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate  or the income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax expense  increased to from an effective tax rate of for all of fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the relative sources of total revenues as our up front structural advisory fees increased and our residual revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal our effective tax rate applicable to up front structural advisory fees is greater than our effective tax rate applicable to residual revenues 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted  and we expect that they will continue to consist of  capital expenditures  working capital  business development expenses  general corporate expenses  repurchases of our common stock  quarterly cash dividends and potential acquisitions 
short term funding requirements we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through cash flow from operations 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least fiscal long term funding requirements we expect to fund the growth of our business through cash flow from operations and through issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we enter into an acquisition or strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  which could harm the growth of our business  or we may be required to reduce or eliminate our quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders 
our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including the timing  size and structure of the securitization transactions that we structure  as well as the composition of the loan pool being securitized  the amount and timing of receipt of additional structural advisory fees and residuals  our operating and information systems needs  the extent to which our services gain increased market acceptance and remain competitive  the extent to which we repurchase shares of our common stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders  regulatory capital requirements applicable to union federal  the timing and magnitude of income tax payments  and the costs and timing of acquisitions of complementary businesses 
treasury stock we had treasury stock of million at june  and million at june  our treasury stock balance was primarily derived from the repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions 
treasury stock also includes shares of our stock forfeited by employees to satisfy statutory minimum withholding obligations as equity compensation awards vest 
our board of directors approved the repurchase of  shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal and approved the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal on april   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
the  shares authorized for repurchase included  shares available for repurchase as of april  under the previously authorized repurchase programs 
as of june   we had repurchased an aggregate of  shares at an average price  excluding commissions  of per share 
at june  a maximum of  shares may be repurchased under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors on april  cash  cash equivalents and investments at june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
at june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments is primarily due to cash generated from our securitization transactions  offset by cash used to fund operations  cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock during fiscal cash  cash equivalents and investments at june  primarily included investments in variable rate demand notes  mortgage backed securities  federal home loan bank bonds and funds deposited in a money market fund that invests in short term obligations of the us treasury and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by obligations of the us treasury 
loans held for sale at june   we had loans held for sale of million as compared to no loans at june  the increase in loans held for sale resulted from our acquisition of union federal on november  our loans held for sale at june  were comprised of education and mortgage loans 
service receivables our service receivables increased to million at june  from million at june   primarily as a result of the additional structural advisory fees and residuals generated from the securitization transactions 
the increase in service receivables was also due to a net increase in our estimate of the fair value of our residuals receivable of million during fiscal  primarily as a result of the accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates due to the passage of time  resulting in an increase of million  which was partially offset by changes in assumptions and the negative impact of other factors such as a higher rate of prepayments during the period than we estimated would occur having a net negative impact of million 
property and equipment  net in fiscal  our property and equipment  net increased by million  as million of depreciation expense recorded during the period was more than offset by million we spent on the expansion and improvement of our loan processing facilities and systems 
in fiscal  we financed the acquisition of million in equipment through capital leases 
prepaid income taxes at june   we had prepaid income taxes of million as compared to million at june  the increase in prepaid income taxes balance at june  compared to june  was primarily due to a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the the timing of our recognition of additional structural advisory fees as income for tax purposes 
as a result of the ruling  we pay income tax upon receipt  rather than recognition  of such fees 
at june   this balance was primarily derived from the income tax benefit of employee stock option exercises and tax allocation strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal other prepaid expenses other prepaid expenses increased to million at june  from million at june   primarily due to an increase in prepaid marketing expenses of approximately million 
other assets other assets increased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to million in principal and fees owed to union federal  our subsidiary  as a result of cancelled loans from borrowers 
deposits at june   we had deposits of million as compared to no deposits at june  the increase in deposits resulted from our acquisition of union federal on november  included in deposits at june  is million of brokered deposits  primarily brokered certificates of deposits 
accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at june  from million at june  our accrued bonuses were approximately million higher at june  as compared to june  due to an increase in accruals related to our employee incentive compensation plans  primarily as a result of our positive financial results in fiscal our accounts payable were million higher at june  as compared to june  primarily due to the timing of the receipt and processing of invoices 
net deferred income tax liability our net deferred income tax liability increased to million at june  from million at june  we have a net deferred income tax liability primarily because  under gaap  we recognize additional structural advisory fees and residuals in financial statement income earlier than they are recognized for income tax purposes 
our net deferred income tax liability increased primarily as a result of the increase in residual revenue recognized during fiscal  which more than offset the recognition of our share of taxable income from the securitization trusts 
our net deferred income tax liability also increased in fiscal as a result of the favorable ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the timing of our recognition of additional structural advisory fees in taxable income 
capital lease obligations capital lease obligations decreased to million at june  from million at june   primarily due to scheduled principal payments made during fiscal notes payable to teri notes payable to teri decreased to million at june  from million at june  the balance relates to two acquisition notes we issued to finance the acquisition of teri s loan processing operations  as well as its loan database in the decrease in notes payable to teri was due to the scheduled principal payments made during fiscal other liabilities other liabilities increased to million at june  from million at june  the balance at the end of each fiscal period related primarily to deferred rent related to several operating leases for office space 
contractual obligations in addition to our notes payable and the agreement with teri to purchase updates to the student loan database  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating and capital leases 
the table below summarizes the dollar amounts of our contractual obligations as of june  for the periods specified contractual obligations fiscal year long term debt database purchases operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total in thousands total cash flows our net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from increases in net income  which includes our increased up front structural advisory fee revenue  and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  offset in part by increases in residual receivables and structural advisory fee receivables 
our cash used in investing activities decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million used in investing activities in fiscal net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of a decrease in net purchases of investments  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to the expansion and improvement of our loan processing facilities and systems 
net cash used in financing activities increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in cash used for dividends  offset in part by an increase in deposits 
we expect that our capital expenditure requirements for fiscal will be approximately million 
we expect to use these funds primarily for the expansion of our loan processing operations and the purchase of computer and office equipment 
borrowings in june  we issued two acquisition notes to teri totaling million to finance the acquisition of teri s loan processing operations as well as its loan database 
principal and interest at an annual rate of is payable on these notes in monthly payments of  commencing on july  and ending on june  at june   outstanding principal on these notes totaled million as compared to million at june  off balance sheet transactions we offer outsourcing services in connection with the lifecycle of a private student loan  from program design and marketing coordination through loan administration and  ultimately  to the sale and securitization of the loans 
we also structure and facilitate the securitization of student loans for our clients through a series of bankruptcy remote  qualified special purpose trusts 
the principal uses of these trusts are to generate sources of liquidity for our clients assets sold into such trusts and to reduce their credit risk  make available more funds to students and colleges  and leverage the capital markets to reduce borrowing costs to students

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  an amendment of fasb statements no 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the statement permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the statement also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  consistent with its requirements  we will adopt fin no 
on july  we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  and requires entities to elect either fair value measurement with changes in fair value reflected in earnings or the amortization and impairment requirements of fasb statement no 
for subsequent measurement 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the statement permits interests in hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  to be accounted for as a single financial instrument at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
this election is permitted on an instrument by instrument basis for all hybrid financial instruments held  obtained  or issued as of the adoption date 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks related to cash  cash equivalents and investments we have market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates applicable to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we manage our market risk through a conservative investment policy  the primary objective of which is preservation of capital 
at june   cash  cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of investments in variable rate demand notes and money market funds  all of which were due on demand or within one year 
as a result  we do not believe a change in interest rate would have a material impact on the fair value of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
risks related to loans held for sale and deposits we also have market risk exposure related to our loans held for sale and deposits 
our loans held for sale at june  consisted of million in mortgage loans and million in education loans 
our loans held for sale are recorded at lower of cost or fair value and are primarily sensitive to interest rates 
at june   our mortgage loans had an average interest rate of approximately and our student loans had an average interest rate of approximately 
all of our education loans and approximately of our mortgage loans have variable interest rates 
we held deposits of million at june  our deposits are recorded at the amount owed 
our deposit balances are subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions  primarily changes in the levels of interest rates 
at june   our deposits had an average interest rate of approximately 
less than of our deposits have fixed interest rates in excess of months 
approximately of our deposits have fixed interest rates of months or less 
we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our loans held for sale or deposits since the majority of these assets and liabilities carry interest rates that are variable and any loss we may incur would not be material relative to our consolidated financial statements 
risk related to structural advisory fees and residuals because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivables  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and various assumptions to estimate their values 
we base these estimates on our proprietary historical data  third party data and our industry experience  adjusting for specific program and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
increases in our estimates of defaults  prepayments and discount rates  increases in the spread between libor and auction rate indices  as well as decreases in default recovery rates and the multi year forward estimates of the libor rate  which is the reference rate for the loan assets and borrowings of the securitization trusts  would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals 
for an analysis of the estimated change in our structural advisory fees and residuals receivables balance at june  based on changes in these loan performance assumptions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates sensitivity analysis
