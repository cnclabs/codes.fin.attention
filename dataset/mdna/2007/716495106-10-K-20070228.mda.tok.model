item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulations domestic exploration for  production and sale of  oil and natural gas are extensively regulated at both the federal  state and local levels 
legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry that often are costly to comply with and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
in addition  production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry  constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities 
state regulatory authorities have established rules and regulations requiring permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
most states in which we operate also have statutes and regulations governing a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells 
many states also restrict production to the market demand for oil and natural gas 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and natural gas could otherwise be produced from our properties 
we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations are administered by the united states environmental protection agency and various other federal  state  and local environmental  zoning  health and safety agencies  many of which periodically examine our operations to monitor compliance with such laws and regulations 
these regulations govern the release of waste materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  human  animal and plant health  and affect our operations and costs 
in recent years  environmental regulations have taken a cradle to grave approach to waste management  regulating and creating liabilities for the waste at its inception to final disposition 
our oil and natural gas exploration  development and production operations are subject to numerous environmental programs  some of which include solid and hazardous waste management  water protection  air emission controls and situs controls affecting wetlands  coastal operations and antiquities 
environmental programs typically regulate the permitting  construction and operations of a facility 
many factors  including public perception  can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit 
once operational  enforcement measures can include significant civil penalties for regulatory violations regardless of intent 
under appropriate circumstances  an administrative agency can request a cease and desist order to terminate operations 
new programs and changes in existing programs are anticipated  some of which include natural occurring radioactive materials  oil and natural gas exploration and production waste management and underground injection of waste materials 
each state in which we operate has laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution 
many states also have regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration  development and production operations 
we are also subject to federal and state hazard communications and community right to know statutes and regulations 
these regulations govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances 
we believe we are in compliance with these requirements in all material respects 
we may be required in the future to make substantial outlays to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the additional changes in operating procedures and expenditures required to comply with future laws dealing with the protection of the environment cannot be predicted

item a 
risk factors oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we will be able to borrow under our senior revolving credit facility will be subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
among the factors that can cause volatility are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other producing countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  political instability  armed conflict or terrorist attacks  whether or not in oil or natural gas producing regions  the level of consumer product demand  the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets  such as china  labor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions  weather conditions  including hurricanes and other natural occurrences that affect the supply and or demand of oil and natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the price of foreign imports  worldwide economic conditions  and the availability of liquid natural gas imports 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas 

table of contents unless we replace our reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in general  the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration activities 
thus  our future oil and natural gas production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
however  we cannot assure you that our future acquisition  development and exploration activities will result in any specific amount of additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe is thorough 
however  there is no assurance that such a review will reveal all existing or potential problems or allow us to fully assess the deficiencies and capabilities of such properties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties at acceptable prices because the competition for producing oil and natural gas properties is particularly intense at this time and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
our bank lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities  which may materially impact our operations 
as of december   we had approximately billion of long term debt 
as of december   the borrowing base under our senior revolving credit facility was million and we had outstanding borrowings under the facility of million 
the borrowing base limitation under our senior revolving credit facility is semi annually redetermined 
redeterminations are based upon a number of factors  including commodity prices and reserve levels 
upon a redetermination  our borrowing base could be substantially reduced 
we utilize cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and debt and equity financings to fund our development  acquisition and exploration activities 
a reduction in our borrowing base could limit our activity in this regard 
in addition  we may significantly alter our capitalization in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level of debt 
if we incur additional debt for these or other purposes  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
a higher level of debt also increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance which is affected by general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends  dispose of assets or issue shares of preferred stock and otherwise may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  a more leveraged financial position would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures  and any debt that we incur under our senior revolving credit facility will be at variable rates which make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our ability to finance our business activities will require us to generate substantial cash flow 
our business activities require substantial capital 
we have budgeted drilling expenditures of million 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures in the future primarily through cash flow from operations 

table of contents we cannot be sure that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production from existing wells  prices of oil and natural gas  our results in locating and producing new reserves  the success and timing of development of proved undeveloped reserves  and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our budgeted drilling expenditures  we may be forced to reduce such expenditures or obtain additional financing through the issuance of debt and or equity 
we cannot be sure that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
the level of our debt financing could also materially affect our operations 
if our cash flows were to decrease due to lower oil and natural gas prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through our senior revolving credit facility or otherwise  our ability to execute our development and acquisition plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves 
this report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated reserves were classified as proved undeveloped 
estimates of proved undeveloped reserves are less certain than estimates of proved developed reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves in accordance with sec regulations  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs or estimated reserves are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
we depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees  particularly with respect to providing the critical management decisions and contacts necessary to manage and maintain growth within a highly competitive industry 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  
table of contents particularly in the oil and natural gas industry  and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience 
under these conditions  we could be unable to attract and retain these personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our business is highly competitive 
the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in many respects  including identification of attractive oil and natural gas properties for acquisition  drilling and development  securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities 
in seeking suitable opportunities  we compete with a number of other companies  including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources  larger numbers of personnel and facilities  and  in some cases  with more expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas production  we have entered into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production 
we will most likely enter into additional hedging transactions in the future 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 
our oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control 
our operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for  producing  transporting  marketing and selling oil and natural gas 
although we may take precautionary measures  many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances 
many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses  the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial quantities  the rate of production and the economics of the development of  and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest 
any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
such risks and hazards include human error  accidents  labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities  blowouts  fires  hurricanes  pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells  producing formations  production facilities and equipment  unavailability of materials and equipment  engineering and construction delays  unanticipated transportation costs and delays  unfavorable weather conditions  hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions  
table of contents environmental regulations and requirements  accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials  such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids  into the environment  hazards resulting from the presence of hs in gas we produce  changes in laws and regulations  including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural gas produced  fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production  and the availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available 
as a result of these risks  expenditures  quantities and rates of production  revenues and cash operating costs may be materially adversely affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us 
governmental and environmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations on taxation  the exploration for and development  production and marketing of oil and natural gas and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  prevention of waste  unitization and pooling of properties and other matters 
these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning our oil and natural gas wells and other facilities 
in addition  these laws and regulations  and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production  could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells  which could limit our revenues 
our operations are also subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various jurisdictions in which we have or expect to have oil and natural gas operations 
we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  natural gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water  including responsibility for remedial costs 
we could potentially discharge these materials into the environment in any of the following ways from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site  from gathering systems  pipelines  transportation facilities and storage tanks  damage to oil and natural gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations  and blowouts  hurricanes  cratering and explosions 
because the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed  we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the future  including changes to existing laws and regulations  will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  because we acquire interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by the former operators 
we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  
table of contents medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
as is common in the oil and natural gas industry  we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss 
title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects 
we generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire 
however  there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure 
generally  under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties  any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss 
assets we acquire may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due significantly to acquisitions of exploration and production companies  producing properties and undeveloped leaseholds 
we expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  including estimates of recoverable reserves  exploration potential  future oil and natural gas prices  operating and capital costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every well 
even when we inspect a well  we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
as a result of these factors  we may not be able to acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
our exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 
we require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage in order to further our development efforts 
exploration  development  drilling and production activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered 
we invest in property  including undeveloped leasehold acreage  which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time 
however  we cannot guarantee that all of our prospects will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that the leasehold acreage we acquire will be profitably developed  that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our 
table of contents investment in such leasehold acreage or wells 
drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs 
in addition  wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return 
our ability to achieve our target results are dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil and natural gas  costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 
we rely to a significant extent on d seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects and in conducting our exploration activities 
the d seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to our acquisition of leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether oil or gas is present or may be produced economically 
the use of d seismic data and other technologies also requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
in addition  we may not be successful in controlling and reducing our drilling and production costs in order to improve our overall return 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
we cannot predict the cost of drilling  and we may be forced to limit  delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  and compliance with governmental requirements 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
as a result of increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas  the demand for oilfield services has risen  and the costs of these services are increasing  while the quality of these services may suffer 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in texas and louisiana  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in those areas 
in order to secure drilling rigs in these areas  we have entered into certain contracts with drilling companies that extend over several years 
if demand for drilling rigs subsides during the period covered by these contracts  the price we are required to pay may be significantly more than the market rate for similar services 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends on services and facilities that we typically do not own or control 
the failure or inaccessibility of any such services or facilities could result in a curtailment of production and revenues 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
pursuant to interruptible or short term transportation agreements  we generally deliver gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
under the interruptible transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system  or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements 
if any of the pipelines or other facilities become unavailable  we would be required to find a suitable alternative to transport and process the gas  which could increase our costs and reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the gas 

table of contents we depend on the skill  ability and decisions of third party operators to a significant extent 
the success of the drilling  development and production of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws  rules and regulations affecting such properties 
the failure of any third party operator to make decisions  perform their services  discharge their obligations  deal with regulatory agencies  and comply with laws  rules and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties  including substantial penalties and compliance costs 
such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
we may be required to take non cash asset writedowns if oil and natural gas prices decline 
we may be required under full cost accounting rules to writedown the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties if oil and natural gas prices decline or if there are substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
under full cost accounting  we are required by sec regulations to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum  or ceiling  of the book value of oil and natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value discounted at of the future net cash flows from proved reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges when hedge accounting is applied  calculated using prevailing oil and natural gas prices on the last day of the period or a subsequent higher price under certain limited circumstances 
if the net book value of oil and natural gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligation exceeds the ceiling limitation  sec regulations require us to impair or writedown the book value of our oil and natural gas properties 
depending on the magnitude  a ceiling test writedown could significantly reduce income  or produce a loss 
as ceiling test computations involve the prevailing oil and natural gas prices  as of a fixed date  it is impossible to predict the likelihood  timing and magnitude of any future impairments 
the book value of our proved oil and natural gas properties increased in and during as a function of higher acquisition  exploration and development costs 
to the extent finding and development costs continue to increase  we will become more susceptible to ceiling test writedowns in lower price environments 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of non cash goodwill impairments 
in conjunction with the recording of the purchase price allocation for several of our acquisitions including kcs  we recorded goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price paid by us for those companies plus liabilities assumed  including deferred taxes recorded in connection with the respective acquisitions  over the estimated fair market value of the tangible net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent of any excess of its carrying amount over the residual fair value of the business 
such non cash impairment could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs  and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity
