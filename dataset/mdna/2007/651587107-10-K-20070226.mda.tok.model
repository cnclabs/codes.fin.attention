recent developments in january  foundry park i  llc foundry park i  a wholly owned subsidiary of newmarket development  entered into a deed of lease agreement with meadwestvaco corporation meadwestvaco under which meadwestvaco will lease an office building which will be constructed on approximately three acres of real property which is owned by foundry park i 
the property is part of a larger office park and mixed use development known as foundry park 
the office building is designed to include approximately  
table of contents rentable square feet 
in addition to the office building  meadwestvaco has the right to parking facilities that are expected to contain approximately  parking spaces  and the right to use all common areas within the office building and foundry park 
foundry park i plans to invest between approximately million and million in completing construction of the building 
most of the cost will be financed through construction and permanent indebtedness 
foundry park i expects construction to require at least two years 
the lease  which will cover the entire office building  is a long term lease with lease payments at competitive market rates

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
those risk factors are outlined below 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in certain of the product lines and markets in which we compete 
we expect that our competitors will develop and introduce new and enhanced products  which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of certain products we manufacture 
our competition may also expand their production capacity  which could decrease market prices for our products and adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  as a result of price competition  we may be compelled to reduce the prices for some of our products  which could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers 
our inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater financial  technological  and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility 
table of contents than we are able to maintain 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices for raw materials  and changes in general economic conditions 
sudden or sharp raw materials price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  maleic anhydride  olefin copolymers  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest  or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products 
availability of raw materials and transportation systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the chemical industry and transportation industry are in a situation where supply and demand are in balance 
any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials or transportation systems 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our principal customers are major multinational oil companies 
the oil industry is characterized by concentration of a few large participants as a result of consolidation 
two of our customers individually accounted for more than of our net sales in net sales for to bp amounted to million of total net sales  and net sales to shell amounted to million of total net sales 
the loss of either of these customers  or a material reduction in purchases by either of them  or by any other large or significant customer  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our customers are concentrated in the lubricant and fuel industries and  as a result  our reliance on that industry is significant 
most of our customers are primarily engaged in the fuel and lubricant industries 
this concentration of customers affects our overall risk profile  since our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic  geopolitical  and industry conditions 
many factors affect the level of our customers spending on our products  including  among others  general business conditions  changes in technology  interest rates  gasoline prices  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
a sudden or protracted downturn in these industries could adversely affect the buying power and purchases by our customers 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
our future business success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our industry is characterized by frequent changes in industry performance standards  which affect the amount and timing of our research and development costs and other technology related costs 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is often hard to predict 
further  technological changes in some or all of our customers products or processes may make our products obsolete 
any inability to anticipate  respond to  
table of contents or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow in any given period 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition  or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges  and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity  and complexity of our operations 
our tel business has declined and will continue to decline 
historically  tel  an octane enhancer in leaded gasoline used to improve ignition qualities and operating performance of fuel  has been a material component of our product line 
however  during the s  the implementation of the federal clean air act led to the use of catalytic converters that are deemed no longer compatible with leaded gasoline  and unleaded gasoline became the fuel standard in the united states with other countries following 
as a result  our tel financial results have declined 
the tel segment represented approximately of our segment operating profit 
we do not expect tel to rebound from this low level of profits 
our tel results would be adversely affected if innospec did not comply with the terms of the marketing and supply agreements or if we did not prevail in our arbitrations with innospec 
results for our tel segment include the operating profit contribution from marketing agreements between ethyl or its subsidiaries and subsidiaries of innospec for the sale of tel outside of north 
table of contents america 
innospec is now the only manufacturer of tel worldwide 
under our marketing agreements with innospec  we receive of the net proceeds from the sale of tel by innospec in all regions of the world  except north america 
as a result  our tel results would be adversely affected if innospec did not comply with the terms of the marketing agreements 
after the commencement of the arbitration discussed below  ethyl received three requests for arbitration filed by three subsidiaries of innospec related to the marketing agreements 
innospec is claiming the right to terminate the agreements 
although the marketing agreements relate only to tel  innospec contends that the agreements impose certain duties that were breached by sales and marketing of mmt in iraq and south africa by affiliates of ethyl 
although we believe these claims have no merit  an adverse outcome in the arbitrations could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
ethyl filed a request for arbitration against a subsidiary of innospec related to a supply agreement that requires the innospec subsidiary to supply ethyl with tel for resale by ethyl in the united states 
ethyl filed this request because it believes that innospec has violated the supply agreement by attempting to increase the price it charges ethyl for tel in the united states in a manner not in accordance with the contract 
the difference in prices that innospec is claiming is approximately million for product supplied through september  and would amount to approximately an additional million if the same factors were applied to tel supplied in the fourth quarter we are confident in our position and believe we will prevail 
regardless of the outcome  we do not believe the tel dispute will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  with tel segment operating profit at such a low level  a relatively small increase in cost resulting from this arbitration could be material to tel segment results 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of the products we produce or sell are produced only in one location 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of those production facilities 
those production facilities are subject to various hazards associated with the manufacture  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unscheduled downtime  and environmental hazards 
some of our products involve the manufacture and handling of a variety of reactive  explosive  and flammable materials 
many of these hazards could cause a disruption in the production of our products 
we cannot assure you that these facilities will not experience these types of hazards and disruptions in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in any given period 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
in  net sales to customers outside north america accounted for approximately of total net sales 
we do business in all major regions of the world  some of which do not have stable economies or governments 
in particular  we sell and market products in countries experiencing political and economic instability in the middle east  asia pacific  and latin america 
our international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  increases in royalties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  taxes  government royalties  inflationary economies and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies such as restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these factors may increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our business 

table of contents we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we conduct our business in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements  as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  compounds  and other technologies is important to our business 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark  and copyright law  as well as judicial enforcement  to protect such technologies 
we currently own approximately  issued us and foreign patents  with a significant number of additional patents pending 
some of these patents are licensed to others 
in addition  we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses or otherwise 
we have developed and may in the future develop technologies with universities or other academic institutions  or with the use of government funding 
in such cases  the academic institution or the government may retain certain rights to the developed intellectual property 
we also own approximately trademark and service mark registrations throughout the world for our marks  including afton chemical  ethyl  hitec  greenburn and mmt  as well as pending trademark and service mark applications  including biotec  tecgard and newmarket sm 
in the event that we are unable to continue using certain of our marks  we may be forced to rebrand our products  which could result in the loss of brand recognition  and could require us to devote resources to advertise and market brands 
in particular  the loss of our hitec mark would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that the measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
the failure of our patents or other measures to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

table of contents our business is subject to government regulation  and could be adversely affected by future governmental regulation 
we are subject to regulation by local  state  federal  and foreign governmental authorities 
in some circumstances  before we may sell certain products  these authorities must approve these products  our manufacturing processes  and facilities 
we are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products  manufacturing processes  and facilities by governmental authorities 
in order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products  we must  among other things  demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations 
the process of seeking approvals can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated and significant delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis  or at all 
any delay in obtaining  or any failure to obtain or maintain  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate net sales from those products 
new laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscation  recall  or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution  and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls or seizures  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our business and our customers will be subject to significant new regulations under the european commission s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulation 
reach will enter into force on june  it imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports  including testing data  on each chemical substance  perform chemical safety assessments  and obtain pre market authorization with respect to certain substances of particularly high concern 
the new regulation imposes significant additional burdens on chemical producers and importers  and  to a lesser extent  downstream users of chemical substances and preparations 
our manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will likely require us to incur significant additional compliance costs 
political  economic  and regulatory factors concerning one of our products  mmt  could adversely affect our sales of mmt 
the epa studied mmt and determined that it does not cause or contribute to the failure of vehicle emission systems 
the canadian government has made similar findings 
however  the epa is requiring additional testing to fill some data gaps  including potential risks to public health  and a change in current determinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  certain industry groups are urging greater regulation of all metal based gasoline additives  including mmt 
in  the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam issued a fleet test report on mmt based on tests conducted by the aam  the association of international automobile manufacturers  and the canadian vehicle manufacturers association 
the report alleges that mmt significantly raises vehicle emissions  increases fuel emissions  increases fuel consumption  and impairs the proper operation of vehicle emission control systems 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt on vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review 
substantially all of our customers in canada have suspended the use of mmt  pending the results of the government of canada sponsored independent third party review 
to date  the government of canada has not initiated the review 
we expect that the european union will also review all metal based petroleum additives  including mmt  for their impact on pollution abatement technology 
increased government regulation of mmt if it occurs or additional studies evaluating mmt  even if government regulation does not occur  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of that product 

table of contents legal proceedings and other claims could impose substantial costs on us 
we are involved in numerous administrative and legal proceedings that result from  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
from time to time  these proceedings involve environmental  product liability  tel  premises asbestos liability  and other matters 
see item  legal proceedings 
we have insurance coverage that we believe would be available to mitigate potential damages in many of these proceedings 
however  there is no assurance that our available insurance will cover these claims  that our insurers will not challenge coverage for certain claims  or that final damage awards will not exceed our available insurance coverage 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations 
as a manufacturer and distributor of chemical products  we are generally subject to extensive local  state  federal  and foreign environmental  safety  and health laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land and water  the generation  handling  treatment  and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials  and remediation of contaminated soil  surface  and ground water 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
we believe our operations are currently in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and the enforcement or interpretation of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
although we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements  the costs could be material 
non compliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines  damages arising from third party lawsuits  or the suspension and potential cessation of non compliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  and personal injury 
we cannot assure you that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  on site facilities or underground tanks for the storage of chemicals  hazardous materials  and waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or contamination of the environment 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury  product liability  property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances  such as premises asbestos  at or from our facilities 
we may also face liability for personal injury  product liability  property damage  natural resource damage  or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contaminants or hazardous substances from our facilities or for future accidents or spills 
a significant increase in the number or success of these claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
for further discussion of some related claims  see item  business environmental 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
a liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  whether currently or formerly owned 
table of contents or operated regardless of fault  knowledge  timing of the contamination  cause of the contamination  percentage of contribution to the contamination  or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including clean up costs  natural resource damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions  and third party claims  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a prp in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp 
as a prp  we may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up hazardous waste sites  such as a landfill to which we may have sent waste 
in de minimis prp matters and in some minor prp matters  we generally negotiate a consent decree to pay an apportioned settlement 
this relieves us of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
settlement costs for a de minimis participant are less than  settlement costs for a minor participant are less than we are also a prp at superfund sites where our liability may be in excess of de minimis or minor prp levels 
most superfund sites where we are a prp represent environmental issues that are quite mature 
the sites have been investigated  and in many cases  the remediation methodology  as well as the proportionate shares of each prp have been established 
other sites are not as mature  which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of future clean up or remediation costs 
generally  remediation and monitoring will go on for an extended period 
as a result  we may incur substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years  a portion of which may be covered by insurance 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which reduces your ability to gauge our performance 
external factors beyond our control  such as customer orders  product shipment dates  and other factors can cause shifts in net sales and income from quarter to quarter 
these external factors can magnify the impact of industry cycles 
as a result  our income and cash flow may fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis  and your ability to gauge trends in our business may be impaired 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production or our transportation systems and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling  and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment  and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations  and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

table of contents we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension funds  which may be underfunded due to past and any future under performance of the equities markets 
our pension plan asset allocation is predominantly weighted towards equities 
cash contribution requirements to our pension plans are sensitive to changes in our plans actual return on assets 
reductions in our plans expected return on assets due to poor performance of the equities markets could cause our pension plans to be underfunded and require us to make additional cash contributions 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption  and casualty insurance  but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including natural disasters and domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
federal legislation is under consideration that could impose significant new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities that may increase our overhead expenses 
federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive

operating rates of the plants vary with product mix and normal sales swings 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
item legal proceedings we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund 
some of these legal proceedings relate to environmental matters and involve governmental authorities 
for further information see environmental in part i  item while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  we believe the outcome of any of these proceedings  or all of them combined  will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
innospec inc on august   ethyl filed a request for arbitration against a subsidiary of innospec 
this arbitration is related to a long standing supply agreement that requires the innospec subsidiary to supply ethyl with tel for resale by ethyl in the united states the us supply agreement 
the request was filed pursuant to the rules of the london court of international arbitration 
ethyl filed this request because it believes that innospec has violated the us supply agreement by attempting to increase the price it charges ethyl for tel in the united states in a manner not in accordance with the contract 
as such  we have not recorded an accrual of these costs 
the difference in prices that innospec is claiming is approximately million for product supplied through september  and would amount to approximately an additional million if the same factors were applied to tel supplied in the fourth quarter we have placed million for product supplied through september  in an escrow account pending resolution of the arbitration 
we are confident in our position and believe we will prevail 
regardless of the outcome  we do not believe the tel dispute will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  with tel segment operating profit at such a low level  a relatively small increase in cost may be material to tel segment results 
after the commencement of the above arbitration  ethyl received three requests for arbitration filed by three subsidiaries of innospec 
the innospec requests were filed on october   pursuant to the rules of the london court of international arbitration and allegedly pursuant to long standing marketing and supply agreements between ethyl or its subsidiaries and subsidiaries of innospec for the sale of tel outside of the united states 
innospec is claiming the right to terminate the agreements and is seeking damages 
although these marketing and supply agreements relate only to tel  innospec contends that the agreements impose certain duties that were breached by the sales and marketing of mmt in iraq and south africa by affiliates of ethyl 
ethyl will vigorously defend the cases and believes it will ultimately prevail in these arbitrations 
therefore  no accrual has been recorded

these cases involve exposure to asbestos in premises owned or operated  or formerly owned or operated  by subsidiaries of newmarket 
we have never manufactured  sold  or distributed products that contain asbestos 
nearly all of these cases are pending in texas  louisiana  or illinois and involve multiple defendants 
we maintain an accrual for these proceedings  as well as a receivable for expected insurance recoveries 
during  we entered into an agreement with travelers indemnity company travelers resolving certain long standing issues regarding our coverage for certain premises asbestos claims 
in addition  our agreement with travelers provides a procedure for allocating defense and indemnity costs with respect to certain future premises asbestos claims 
the lawsuit we had previously filed against travelers in the southern district of texas was dismissed 
we also settled our outstanding receivable from albemarle for certain premises asbestos liability obligations 
the accrual for our premises asbestos liability related to currently asserted claims is based on the following assumptions and factors we are often one of many defendants 
this factor influences both the number of claims settled against us and also the indemnity cost associated with such resolutions 
the estimated percent of claimants in each case that will actually  after discovery  make a claim against us  out of the total number of claimants in a case  is based on a level consistent with past experience and current trends 
we utilize average comparable plaintiff cost history as the basis for estimating pending premises asbestos related claims 
these claims are filed by both former contractors employees  and former employees who worked at past and present company locations 
we also include an estimated inflation factor in the calculation 
no estimate is made for unasserted claims 
the estimated recoveries from insurance and albemarle for these cases are based on  and are consistent with  the settlement agreements 

table of contents based on the above assumptions  we have provided an undiscounted liability related to premises asbestos claims of million at year end and million at year end the liabilities related to asbestos claims are included in accrued expenses current portion and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet 
certain of these costs are recovered through our insurance coverage and agreement with albemarle 
the receivable for these recoveries related to premises asbestos liabilities was million at december  and million at december  these receivables are included in trade and other accounts receivable for the current portion 
the noncurrent portion is included in other assets

when we use words in this document  such as anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  expects  and similar expressions  we do so to identify forward looking statements 
examples of forward looking statements include statements we make regarding future prospects of growth in the petroleum additives market  the level of future declines in the market for tel  our ability to maintain or increase our market share  and our future capital expenditure levels 
we believe our forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations and assumptions  within the bounds of what we know about our business and operations 
however  we offer no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations due to uncertainties and factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  timing of sales orders  gain or loss of significant customers  competition from other manufacturers  resolution of environmental liabilities  changes in the demand for our products  significant changes in new product introduction  increases in product cost  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on reported results of operations  changes in various markets  geopolitical risks in certain of the countries in which we conduct business  and the impact of consolidation of the petroleum additives industry

overview the year reflected increases in net sales  as well as operating profit  across both lubricant additives and fuel additives as compared to and we supply our customers with a diverse portfolio of products to meet their business needs and we believe this is reflected in our results 
while the petroleum additives industry experienced escalating raw material costs in  we were generally able to recover these costs through improved pricing and the introduction of more cost effective products 
our production facilities are operating at high levels and we are selling a product mix with higher margins 
as expected  the tel market continues to decline and segment operating results are lower than last year 
our balance sheet remains strong at year end our investment in working capital has increased over december  levels in support of our business 
we continue to have no outstanding bank debt 
in late  we completed the refinancing of both our senior notes due and senior credit facility  providing us with more favorable terms and greater flexibility as we look to the future 
results of operations net sales continuing the trend from the last two years  net sales increased in essentially all areas of the petroleum additives segment 
in addition  total consolidated net sales were higher in than in either or when comparing with  net sales increased 
the increase between and was 

table of contents in   and  net sales to two customers of our petroleum additives segment exceeded of total net sales 
sales to bp amounted to million of net sales in  million of total net sales in  and million of total net sales in sales to shell amounted to million of total net sales in  million of total net sales in  and million of total net sales in these net sales represent a wide range of products sold to these two customers in multiple regions of the world 
no other single customer accounted for or more of our total net sales in   or the following table shows our net sales by segment for each of the last three years 
net sales by segment in millions of dollars petroleum additives tetraethyl lead consolidated net sales petroleum additives our petroleum additives sales improved over both and when comparing to  petroleum additives net sales were up million or 
the increase was across both lubricant additives and fuel additives 
increases in selling prices resulted in most of the improvement in net sales  with changes in the mix of products sold also contributing to the higher net sales 
total shipments were essentially unchanged comparing to the change in net sales between the two years also includes a small unfavorable foreign currency impact 
petroleum additives net sales for increased million  or  over levels 
the increase was across all product lines 
shipments were approximately higher than in with the increase predominantly in the engine oil additives product line 
there were smaller increases in industrial additives and fuel additives product lines 
price increases and a favorable foreign currency impact also contributed to the higher net sales 
the approximate components of the petroleum additives increase in net sales of million when comparing to and million when comparing to are shown below in millions 
net sales for year ended december  increase in shipments and changes in product mix changes in selling prices including foreign currency impact net sales for year ended december  increase in shipments and changes in product mix changes in selling prices including foreign currency impact net sales for year ended december  tetraethyl lead most of the tel marketing activity is through the marketing agreements with innospec  under which we do not record the sales transactions 
therefore  the tel net sales shown above are those made by our wholly owned subsidiary  ethyl  in areas not covered by the innospec marketing agreements 
the sales made in areas not covered by the marketing agreements are minor compared to the tel sales made through the innospec marketing agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tel net sales in areas not covered by the innospec marketing agreements were up slightly in over and this increase primarily represents price increases in 
table of contents segment operating profit newmarket evaluates the performance of afton s petroleum additives business and ethyl s tel business based on segment operating profit 
newmarket services departments and other expenses are billed to afton and ethyl based on the services provided under the holding company structure pursuant to service agreements between newmarket services and afton and newmarket services and ethyl 
depreciation on segment property  plant  and equipment  and amortization of segment intangible assets and the prepayments for services are included in the operating profit of each segment 
the table below reports operating profit by segment for the last three years 
the contract manufacturing and other classification in the table below primarily represents certain manufacturing operations that ethyl provides to afton 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
segment operating profit in millions of dollars petroleum additives tetraethyl lead contract manufacturing and other petroleum additives petroleum additives operating profit for increased million  or  when compared to the level of million 
operating profit for includes a gain of million associated with a legal settlement related to transportation charges  as well as a gain of million resulting from a class action lawsuit related to raw materials and a loss of million from other legal settlements 
the increase in operating profit was in both lubricant and fuel additives reflecting improved net sales and profit margins 
net sales were approximately higher than reflecting improved pricing and improvements in product mix 
while raw material costs escalated in  we were able to implement certain price increases 
these price increases have enabled us to restore our margins that have been under pressure since the significant increase in raw material costs began in our production facilities are operating at high rates and we are selling more efficient product formulations 
these improved product formulations lower both our cost  as well as our customers costs 
the results also include a small  unfavorable foreign currency impact 
petroleum additives operating profit for was approximately million  an increase of million  or  over the increases were primarily in the engine oil additives  industrial additives  and certain fuel additives product lines 
while net sales of our remaining fuel additives products also increased  higher raw material costs caused operating profit from these products to be considerably lower in than in overall  the increase in operating profit in as compared to resulted from higher net sales and higher shipments 
the impact of the increases in selling prices that we were able to achieve during the year substantially covered the increases in raw material costs for  with higher shipments accounting for most of the improved profitability 
both and results include a favorable foreign currency impact  primarily from the european union euro 
the results also include a gain of about million from an environmental insurance settlement 
total r d was million in and million in both and the increase in r d when comparing and is across all product lines  but mainly in engine oil additives 
while our r d expenses were the same in both and  the projects and product lines that were researched were quite different 
this is normal for our business and is a function of industry specifications  customers expectations  and competitive forces 
there was also a small favorable foreign currency impact in  but a small unfavorable foreign currency impact in and r d related to new products and processes was million in  million in  and million in all of our r d expenses were related to the petroleum additives segment 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a in for this segment were approximately million higher than  while was approximately million higher than the increase in primarily resulted from higher professional fees and personnel related expenses 
the increases in both and included the impact of an unfavorable foreign currency effect 
as a percentage of net segment sales  sg a combined with r d expenses were in  in  and in the improvement in the percentages when comparing each of the years reflects larger increases in net sales as compared to the smaller increases in sg a and r d 
tetraethyl lead results of our tel segment include the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements and certain tel operations not included in the marketing agreements 
the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements was million in  million in  and million in as expected  volumes shipped declined when comparing both to and to volumes were lower for compared to and lower when comparing and pricing did improve when comparing to and to in addition  amortization of the prepayment for services was approximately million lower in than in and million lower in than in  reflecting the declining balance method of amortization 
these improvements were not enough to offset the impact on operating profit from the decrease in shipments 
the decrease in volumes shipped primarily reflects the result of certain of the major tel customers under the marketing agreement discontinuing use of the product  as well as the ongoing decline in the market as other customers discontinue use of the product 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tel marketing agreements 
the tel market will continue to decline as customers discontinue use of the product 
the loss from other tel operations that was not a part of the marketing agreements was unchanged when comparing to and approximately million unfavorable when comparing to the large prior year variances were primarily due to certain insurance settlements 
while there were none during  the results include a special item of million for an insurance settlement gain related to our premises asbestos liabilities 
the results include a special item gain of million from an environmental insurance settlement 
the results in other tel operations include a favorable impact from lower environmental expenses compared to this favorable impact in from environmental charges was mostly offset by the favorable premises asbestos items in when comparing and  the other tel operations results include lower premises asbestos charges reflecting the favorable impact of a change in expected future insurance reimbursements 
the favorable impact from the premises asbestos items in was partially offset by an increase in environmental clean up costs

as of january   the expected rates were last year for us large cap stocks  last year for us long term corporate bonds  and last year for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
our asset allocation is predominantly weighted toward equities 
through a review of our investments and after reducing our long term rate of return by basis points at december   we have determined that we should maintain the expected long term rate of return for our domestic plans at at december  an actuarial gain  where the actual return exceeds the expected return  occurred during resulting in the actual investment return exceeding the assumed return in by approximately million for all of our domestic pension plans 
despite the actuarial gain for  we continue to have a net unrecognized loss at december  actuarial losses  where the actual return was less than the expected return  resulted during and the one year investment return was lower than the long term assumption by approximately million in and million in for all of our domestic pension plans 
investment losses enter earnings on an amortized basis so that recent years losses resulted in increased expense of approximately thousand in  as well as an expected thousand increased expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for equity investments 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our domestic pension plans by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption under sfas and sfas we utilize the citigroup pension discount curve discount curve and liability index in developing the discount rate assumption 
we apply the expected cash flows of the specific defined benefit retirement plan to the interest rates provided in the discount curve 
the rate is developed based on the discount curve on the last day of december 
the discount rate at december  was 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our domestic pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have maintained our rate of projected compensation increase at december  at 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate domestic cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in while foreign cash contributions will be approximately million 

table of contents other assumptions under sfas during  we reviewed our assumption for the health care cost trend rate under sfas this review was done with reference to cost increases in our own plans  as well as broader market increases in employer provided health care costs and observations of sfas assumptions used by other large employers 
consequently  as of december   we increased our assumption for the health care cost trend rate substantially to a rate of in scaling down to over the next ten years 
previously  the health care cost trend rate was to 
the assumption of declining inflation is consistent with the expectation that medical cost increases will abate after several years of double digit growth 
we have reviewed these assumptions and believe they continue to be appropriate for the expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans is 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
outlook we believe we are in a strong financial position today 
our overall strategy remains unchanged 
it is our intent to leverage our financial strength to grow the business  with acquisitions being an area of primary interest 
our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry 
we believe that in the current mergers and acquisition environment  this industry will provide the greatest opportunity for a good return on investment while minimizing risk 
as we have stated in the past  we remain patient in this pursuit 
we have many internal opportunities for growth in the near term  from both geographical and product line extensions 
we will wait and make the right acquisition for our company when the opportunity arises 
during  we restructured our debt by purchasing our senior notes in a tender offer  issuing new senior notes  and amending and restating the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility 
the new senior notes and credit agreement provide us with lower interest rates and terms that more accurately reflect our improved financial position 
with no bank debt outstanding  we continue to build cash on the balance sheet 
we are considering a full range of uses for this cash 
early in  we announced our intention to develop some of the downtown richmond property that we own by constructing a multi story office building for meadwestvaco 
we plan to invest between approximately million and million in completing construction of the building 
we expect to primarily finance this project through construction and permanent indebtedness 
significant needs for cash for this project will not begin until we will also be investigating a range of other investments 
we will balance all of these options with the likelihood of merger and acquisition activity and decide on the best course of action to increase shareholder value 
petroleum additives by any measure  was an outstanding year for our petroleum additives segment 
we continue to focus on growing our business by helping our customers be successful in their marketplace 
our strategy is twofold cost management in those areas that are commodity like in their characteristics through reformulations and new component introduction and growth through product differentiation in the other areas where margins are higher 
we expect that our approach in will be much the same 
as in any year  there are many variables which will determine the ultimate profit achieved for the year 
raw material costs remain a significant unknown 
we continue to expect significant volatility during in the cost of raw materials that are related to crude oil and natural gas 
base oil pricing has decreased at the beginning of this is primarily a result of higher inventories which may not be sustained as demand increases or as plant turnarounds occur in early however  prices of other raw materials  such as polyisobutylene  alpha olefins  ethylhexanol  and 
table of contents ethyleneamine  continue to stay firm 
in fact  many raw materials we buy today tend to be governed by the supply and demand balance in their own market 
on the demand side  worldwide usage remains strong 
our plants continue to operate at very high rates and we anticipate no slowdown during the year 
as is a constant feature of our business  the costs continue to escalate 
our r d investment increased by in over and we expect it to increase again this year 
the newly adopted reach legislation in europe will further increase our costs 
we have worked hard in the past year to provide better  more cost effective products to our customers 
as a result our margins have improved during we expect to continue on the successes of and expect that petroleum additives will have a higher operating profit in than tel this segment took a significant step down in its overall contribution to our results during this product is being phased out around the world and we expect it to remain a very small contributor to our overall profits 
our plans are to continue to manage costs within this business and to raise prices to reflect the economic value of the product 
critical accounting policies and estimates it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows  as well as our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the sec  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 
our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in reported financial results 
tel marketing agreements services as discussed in various sections of this annual report on form k  we have made certain payments related to our tel marketing agreements 
we made the final payment of million in the unamortized total is million at december  we are amortizing these costs on an accelerated basis using a declining balance method over the life of the contracts 
we believe this is the appropriate methodology and time period for this amortization based on the facts and circumstances of our tel operations and the estimated product life of tel 
the customer base of tel is significantly concentrated in a few countries and when conditions change that cause a shorter product life or other restrictions outside of our control  the amortization period is adjusted accordingly 
any adjustment to the amortization period would impact earnings  but would have no effect on cash flows 
we continue to keep our accounting for this issue current with the business conditions 
the total amortization related to the tel marketing agreements is currently projected to be million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents intangibles  net of amortization we also have certain identifiable intangibles amounting to million at year end that are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and are being amortized over periods with up to ten years of remaining life 
we continue to assess the market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the amortization periods and values are appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when significant events or circumstances occur that might impair the value of these assets 
these evaluations continue to support the value at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in this market  it could possibly cause a reduction in the periods of this amortization charge or result in a noncash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no effect on cash flows 
while we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions  this disclosure is provided to enhance the understanding of the factors involved 
environmental we have made disclosure of our environmental matters in item of this annual report on form k  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k  while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  we do not believe that we will experience any material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we use assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could result in different results for the plans 
we develop these assumptions after considering advice from a major global actuarial consulting firm 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item income taxes we file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns  as well as individual foreign income tax returns  under which assumptions may be made to determine the deductibility of certain costs 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in the determination of the estimated future recovery of deferred tax assets

it further clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with financial accounting statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin on january  we currently do not expect fin to have a material impact on our financial statements  however  we are still finalizing our review 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

the standard defines fair value  outlines a framework for measuring fair value  and details the required disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard is effective for years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials and marketable security prices 
these risk factors may affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives 
as of december   based on our review  we had no contracts with an embedded derivative 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at year end we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million with none of that amount at variable interest rates 
because all of our debt at year end was at a fixed rate  there was no interest rate risk at the end of the year 
if we were to borrow under our senior credit facility in the future  we would experience interest rate risk based on the interest rates available to us at that time 

table of contents since all of our debt at year end is at a fixed rate  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value of our debt 
foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from our plants in the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into million of euro denominated forward contracts to minimize currency exposure from expected cash flows from foreign operations 
the contracts all have maturity dates in and at december   there were million remaining of these euro denominated contracts 
with other variables held constant  a hypothetical adverse change in the december  forward euro rates would have resulted in a decrease of about million in the value of the contracts 
raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  olefin copolymers  maleic anhydride  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit 
financial policy newmarket corporation s financial standards our goal is to present clearly newmarket s financial information to enhance your understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows and our financial condition 
management s report on the financial statements newmarket prepared the financial statements and related notes in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  management made informed judgments and estimates of the expected effects of certain events and transactions on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements 
the same is true for the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during these reporting periods 
financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k is consistent with these financial statements 
however  actual results could differ from the estimates on which these financial statements are based
