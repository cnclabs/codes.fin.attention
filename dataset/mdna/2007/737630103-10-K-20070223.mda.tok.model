the cases purport to be class actions brought on behalf of direct and indirect purchaser classes 
the complaints allege that the defendant osb manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws by purportedly conspiring from mid to the present to drive up the price of osb 
the indirect purchaser complaints also allege that defendants violated various states unfair competition laws and common law
