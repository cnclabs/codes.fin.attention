our series e preferred stock financing  which closed in october  involved the sale of our series e preferred stock at a price per share below the initial public offering price of our common stock contemplated in our initial public filing 
accordingly  pursuant to emerging issues task force  or eitf   accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features  in we recorded a deemed dividend on our series e preferred stock of million  which was the difference between the gross proceeds from our series e preferred stock financing and the underlying value of the conversion shares adjusted for a conversion price adjustment feature and limited to the proceeds allocated to the convertible instrument 
the million deemed dividend was entirely recognized as an adjustment to net loss applicable to common stockholders since our series e preferred stock was convertible  at any time  at the option of the holder

this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel drugs by applying our proprietary technology  scientific expertise and unique capabilities for targeting the liver and liver pathways 
these diseases include metabolic diseases such as diabetes  obesity  and hyperlipidemia  among others  and liver diseases such as hepatitis and primary liver cancer 
we have established a broad and growing product pipeline of product candidates and advanced research programs targeting large markets with significant unmet medical needs 
we have discovered all of our product candidates internally using our proprietary technologies 
we currently have five product candidates in clinical trials 
these five product candidates  by category  and in order from the most advanced in clinical trials within each category  are as follows product pipeline metabolic diseases product candidates programs disease condition partner our commercial rights status cs diabetes daiichi sankyo royalties  north america co promotion option phase b mb diabetes none worldwide phase mb hyperlipidemia none worldwide phase product pipeline liver diseases product candidates programs disease condition partner our commercial rights status pradefovir hepatitis b schering plough royalties phase b completed mb primary liver cancer none worldwide phase completed none of our product candidates have received regulatory approval in the us or in foreign countries 
we have incurred annual net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to develop current and future clinical development candidates  commercialize our product candidates  if any  that receive regulatory approval  continue and expand our research and development programs  and acquire or in license products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
we have a limited history of operations and  to date  we have not generated any product revenues 
in addition to our initial public offering in june  our private placement of common stock and warrants in october and our registered direct offering of common stock in march  we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of preferred stock as well as direct payments of sponsored research funding  license fees  milestone payments  equity investments from our collaborative partners and  to a lesser extent  the sale of common stock through our stockholder approved equity incentive plans 
we have received additional funding through equipment financing arrangements and small business innovation research  or sbir  grants 
our agreements with collaborators may include joint marketing or promotion arrangements of our products 
for example  we have retained co promotion rights for cs in north america with daiichi sankyo 
alternatively  we may grant exclusive marketing rights to our collaborators in exchange for up front fees  milestones and royalties on future sales  if any 
we have licensed worldwide commercialization rights for pradefovir to schering plough 
we do not have collaborative partnerships for mb  mb or mb and are currently independently developing these product candidates 
we retain worldwide commercialization rights to all of the compounds generated from our current research programs  with the exception of product candidates covered by our collaborations with merck and idenix 
we intend to eventually market one or more of the product candidates for which we retain commercialization rights through our own sales force or with a co promotion partner in the us and through strategic collaborations abroad 
we will rely on our partners or third party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of these products for preclinical and clinical studies and large scale commercialization upon their approval 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory review and approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  reliance on third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of cash and stock based compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs associated with preclinical development and clinical trials of our product candidates  facility costs  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the clinical development of mb  mb and mb in addition  research and development activities include work on a variety of compounds in our other discovery research programs 
we are responsible for all costs incurred for these product and clinical candidates and in our discovery research programs with the exception of the ampk and hepatitis c programs partnered with merck and our hepatitis c program partnered with idenix 
under the terms of our collaboration agreements with merck  we had received approximately million in sponsored research funding through december  daiichi sankyo and schering plough are responsible for the costs of clinical development of cs and pradefovir  respectively 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates and lead compounds from our research programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
other than costs for outsourced services associated with our clinical programs  we generally do not track our research and development expenses by project  rather  we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development projects 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we continue the development of our current product candidates  as well as continue and expand our research programs 
generally  phase clinical trials can be expected to last from to months  phase clinical trials can be expected to last from to months and phase clinical trials can be expected to last from to months 
however  clinical development timelines vary widely  as do the total costs of clinical trials and the likelihood of success 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing mb  mb and mb through clinical development  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  our ongoing assessment of its market potential and considering our available financial resources 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and the compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material unfavorable effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when or if any net cash inflow due to sales of any of our current product candidates will commence 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  investor relations  information systems  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  depreciation and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we anticipate continued increases in general and administrative expenses to support our expanding research and development activities and for investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
these increases will also likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
other income  net other income  net includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  net of interest expense 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our agreements generally contain multiple elements  including downstream milestones and royalties 
all fees are nonrefundable 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and collaborator funding  if any  of our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront  nonrefundable fees under our collaborations are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
nonrefundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
amounts received for sponsored research funding are recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
amounts received for sponsored research funding for a specific number of full time researchers are recognized as revenue as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
clinical trial expenses 
our clinical trials are often conducted under contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the actual level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
other incidental costs related to patient enrollment are accrued when known 
if contracted amounts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis 
stock based compensation 
we grant equity based awards under three stockholder approved share based compensation plans 
we may grant options and restricted stock awards to employees  directors and consultants under our amended and restated equity incentive plan 
we also grant awards to non employee directors under our non employee directors stock option plan 
all of our employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan which provides a means for employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 share based payment  which we adopted effective january  we elected to use the modified prospective application in adopting sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
our results of operations for fiscal were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
share based compensation expense recognized as a result of adoption of sfas no 
r for the year ended december  was million 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton  or black scholes option valuation model 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
expected volatility is based on the weighted average volatility of our stock factoring in daily share price observations and the historical price volatility of certain peers within our industry sector 
in computing expected volatility  the length of the historical period used is equal to the length of the expected term of the option and the share purchase right 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period  as permitted under the simplified method  under staff accounting bulletin no 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we had a deferred stock compensation balance of million at december  for options previously issued with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant which was eliminated against additional paid in capital as a result of adoption of sfas no 
r 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 hybrid instruments 
the statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the statement also resolves issues addressed in statement implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
the statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and amends sfas no 
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no  or fin   accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements  but we do not believe compliance with this guidance will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the securities and exchange commission released sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides interpretive guidance on the securities and exchange commission s views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  beginning with our fiscal year 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  beginning with our fiscal year  although earlier application is encouraged 
we have not begun evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our results of operation or financial position  however  we intend to evaluate the impact of adoption of this standard during fiscal results of operations please refer to note to our financial statements for discussion of the reclassification of previously reported financial statements within research and development and general and administrative costs 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the  increase was mainly due to increased license fee and sponsored research revenues of approximately million from our ampk collaboration with merck  which began in the second half of this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in sponsored research revenues from our hepatitis c collaboration with merck  the research portion of which was completed in we expect an increase in sponsored research revenues in compared to as we begin efforts under the sponsored research portion of our agreement with idenix and continue efforts under our ampk collaboration with merck 
in addition  we expect an increase in license fee revenue in as a result of the up front license fee we received from schering plough and our hepatitis c collaboration with idenix 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased spending of million in payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  a million increase in clinical development expense for mb  mb and mb  a million increase in occupancy costs related to our new facility  increased travel  supplies and insurance expense and an increase of  in stock based compensation expense 
we expect continued increases in research and development costs as we continue to advance mb  mb and mb through clinical development 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase primarily relates to an increase of million in professional services related to legal costs associated with patent and corporate related matters and consulting services  increased stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r  higher payroll and related benefits costs of  as a result of a higher average number of employees in and increased travel  occupancy and public company costs of  we anticipate continued increases in general and administrative expenses for investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to increased interest income as a result of higher average cash balances for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in as well as increased yields on investments 
our average cash balances were higher in as compared to due to the net proceeds from our october and march stock offerings 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was mainly due to a decline in milestone revenue of approximately million which was attributable primarily to a million payment earned in the prior year period under our collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo 
this decrease was partially offset by revenues from our ampk collaboration agreement entered into with merck in june which included sponsored research revenue of million and license fee revenue of million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased spending of million in preclinical development expenses for mb  increased research and development services expense of million  an increase of million in payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  increased occupancy costs related to our new facility of million and increased travel  supplies and insurance expense of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily a result of an increase in payroll and related benefits costs of million as a result of a higher average number of employees in  increased travel and occupancy  public company costs of million and increased professional services expense of million 
net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the million net increase was mainly due to higher levels of invested cash in resulting from the proceeds of our october common stock offering  as well as higher investment yields 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily with million in private equity financings and million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in june  a private placement of common stock and warrants in october and a registered direct offering of common stock in march in november  we entered into a committed equity financing facility 
or ceff  with an institutional investor 
under the terms of the ceff the investor is committed to providing us up to million in funding over a three year term through the purchase of newly issued shares of our common stock 
we may access capital under the ceff in tranches of up to the lesser of million or from between to of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down of such tranche  subject to certain conditions 
the investor will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the ceff at discounts ranging from to  depending on the average market price of our common stock during an eight day pricing period  provided that the minimum acceptable purchase price for any shares to be issued to the investor during the eight day pricing period is determined by the higher of or of our share price the day before the commencement of each draw down 
pursuant to the agreement we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the resale of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the ceff and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant discussed below which became effective on december  in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to the investor to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of  which represents a premium over the average of the closing prices of our common stock during the five days preceding the signing of the agreement 
the warrant will become exercisable after the six month anniversary of the effective date of the agreement and will remain exercisable  subject to certain exceptions  until five years after the effective date of the agreement 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with idenix to apply our hepdirect technology to certain idenix lead compounds with the goal of improving the safety and efficacy of these compounds for the treatment of hepatitis c 
the research term will be for two years and may be extended beyond two years by mutual agreement of the parties 
in addition  idenix will have the option to terminate the research term upon the first anniversary of the effective date of the agreement or upon the achievement of certain preclinical and clinical development milestones during the research term 
as part of this collaboration  idenix paid us an initial  non refundable license fee of million in the fourth quarter of and agreed to provide us research funding of up to million per year during the research term 
idenix will also pay us milestones if specified preclinical and clinical development and regulatory events occur and royalties on product sales that result from the collaboration 
if all milestones are achieved  and including the million license fee and up to million per year in research funding over the term  we may be entitled to payments which total up to million  plus royalties 
idenix is solely responsible for conducting and funding all development work for compounds resulting from this collaboration 
in march  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds in a registered direct offering involving the sale of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
placement agency fees and other offering expenses were approximately million 
in october  we raised gross proceeds of approximately million in a private placement of common stock and the concurrent issuance of warrants for the purchase of common stock 
placement agent fees and other offering expenses were approximately million 
under the terms of the financing  we sold million shares of common stock at per share  the closing bid price for our common stock immediately preceding the entering into of the binding agreement for the transaction 
we also issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the closing  investors in the financing paid an additional purchase price equal to per each share issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with merck to research  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics with the potential to treat several metabolic diseases including type diabetes  hyperlipidemia and nash by activating ampk 
as part of this collaboration  merck paid an initial non refundable license fee of million in july and will provide sponsored research funding of a minimum of million each year during the three year research term 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in which we sold approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in july  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option  resulting in the sale of an additional  shares of common stock  which resulted in proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
additionally  we have received cumulative sbir grant funding of approximately million through december  we do not expect additional funding under sbir grants in fiscal as we have discontinued further work under this program 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase is primarily a result of net proceeds of million raised from our registered direct offering in march and a million non refundable license payment under our collaboration with idenix which was offset by net cash used in operations of million and net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulting from net purchases of investments of million and million of equipment purchases 
as of december   we have financed through leases and loans the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at that date 
the loans are collateralized with the purchased equipment  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to  and are due in monthly installments through october we currently anticipate investing approximately million to million in cash in for leasehold improvements and capital equipment necessary to support our clinical development efforts  research programs and to support all other operations 
we expect to continue to finance our capital expenditures through the use of debt 
in november  we entered into a ceff with an institutional investor 
under the terms of the agreement the investor is committed to providing us up to million in funding over a three year term through the purchase of newly issued shares of our common stock as described above 
as of december   we have not exercised our option to sell shares under this agreement 
in the event we determine that the need for an equity financing is necessary to pursue specific strategic initiatives  and we determine that an equity offering under this agreement provides for more favorable terms and results than what may be available through other financing vehicles at the time  and we determine that the market will favorably support the additional equity available  we may utilize our option to sell shares of common stock under this agreement 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we expect to continue to increase our use of cash resources in fiscal for the further advancement of our current product candidates 
this includes  but is not limited to  expenditures for additional personnel to further our preclinical  clinical and regulatory efforts  increased consulting services and increases in facilities and general and administrative support costs 
excluding potential cash inflows from financing activities or additional collaborations and net of anticipated cash inflows from existing collaborations  we currently anticipate utilizing approximately million to million in cash during to support the further development of our current product candidates  research programs and in support of all other operations 
based on our expected cash utilization  we expect to raise additional cash to fund our cash needs beyond the next twelve months through the sale of our common stock  including by the exercise of our option under the ceff  and or by entering into additional collaborations in until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of additional offerings of our equity securities  cash payments under our strategic collaborations  our ceff and debt financing arrangements 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  entering into additional strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under current or future agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases equipment financing purchase commitments capital leases total we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we will make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the clinical trials 
in addition  under certain agreements  we may be subject to penalties in the event we prematurely discontinue performance under these agreements 
at this time  due to the variability associated with these agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur 
we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees that  under certain circumstances  provide for the continuation of salary and certain other benefits if terminated under specified circumstances 
these agreements generally expire upon termination for cause or when the company has met its obligations under these agreements 
as of december   no events have occurred resulting in the obligation of any such payments 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include but are not limited to the following the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of clinical development and research programs we pursue  the costs of expanding our operations  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or contracting for manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses 
environmental risk our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials 
we incurred approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  of costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions  see item of part iii of this annual report on form k  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in short term investment grade securities 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our current investment balance by approximately  annually 
while changes in our interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses are not recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if a reduction in fair value is determined to be a permanent impairment 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our long term capital lease obligations bears interest at fixed rates and therefore we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to these obligations
