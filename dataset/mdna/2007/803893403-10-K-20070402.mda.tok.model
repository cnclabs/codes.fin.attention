we have developed modular inverters such as our three phase utility interactive multi mode inverter for use in connection with large  commercial sized  fuel cell alternative energy power systems such as stationary fuel cell power plants  photo voltaic power plants  wind turbines or microturbine distributed power generation systems that produce power ranging from kilowatts to megawatts 
our powergate inverters are designed to convert the dc power generated by an alternative energy source  such as a fuel cell  into useable ac power 
they also provide the interface with the electric utility grid  an energy storage device  like a battery or flywheel  and the end user applications 
these units use a technology that allows them to be combined and scaled to handle high power requirements 
we introduced this product during fiscal year and  further  introduced inverters for photovoltaic applications in fiscal year product offerings and orders for these kinds of units have grown quickly in and rotary ups systems 
our rotary uninterruptible power supply ups systems are designed to provide both power quality and ups functions in power ranges from kilowatts to megawatts and beyond in single or multiple unit systems 
for comparison  megawatts would be enough power to supply homes each using an average of kilowatts of power 
our rotary ups product combines a diesel generator  supplied by cummins  inc  satcon s preferred supplier  a flywheel energy storage system  electronics and a proprietary control system into an uninterruptible power supply 
we believe that this system is an attractive alternative to lead acid battery based ups systems due to its seamless transition during power outages  increased reliability  longer life and the ability to operate effectively in remote locations 
the protection provided by these systems is critical to defense  government and commercial entities that cannot be out of power even for a fraction of a second 
we also combined several of the rups technical elements into a rotary ride through device concept in which the customer already has an installed emergency generator set but requires the addition of our technology for power sustainability and high power quality

we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability  supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support  enables us to continue to compete successfully against the following competitors manufacturers of inverters for alternative energy such as xantrex technology  inc  asea brown boveri ltd  siemens corporation and alstom sa  manufacturers of custom microcircuit such as natal engineering  aeroflex inc  ms kennedy and sensitron  manufacturers of thin film substrates and resistors such as vishnay and ultrasource  inc  manufacturers of power regulators such as international rectifier  sensitron and ms kennedy  manufacturers of dc to dc converters such as international rectifier  vpt  interpoint and modular devices  manufacturers of motors such as mcg inc  reliance electric co de and other regional and specialty motor manufacturers  manufacturers of uninterruptible power supplies such as piller  inc and hitech power protection bv  and developers of advanced power electronics and machines such as moog  semikron  drs and silicon power 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do and could devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products and may have more manufacturing expertise and capacity 
in addition  some of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do 
manufacturing facilities we manufacture our products at our facilities located in marlborough  massachusetts  west boylston  massachusetts  and burlington  ontario  canada 
we believe our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our current needs 
we believe that most of the raw materials used in our products are readily available from a variety of vendors 
additionally  we design and develop our products to use commodity parts in order to simplify the manufacturing process 
we have a semi automated production line in our marlborough  massachusetts facility 
we intend to add additional production lines for our products in the future as demand dictates and our revenues enable 
we have made and expect to continue to make technological improvements that reduce the costs to manufacture our products 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures or competitive position 
intellectual property our success and competitiveness depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contract restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technologies 
we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees  consultants  and any third parties with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and by restricting access to that information 
as of december   we held approximately us patents and had patent applications pending with the us patent and trademark office 
we have also obtained corresponding patents in the rest of north america  europe and asia 
in addition  we have a non exclusive  royalty free license for non automotive applications for other patents that were issued to our employees and subsequently assigned to daimlerchrysler 
the expiration dates of our patents range from to  with the majority expiring after in  we granted beacon power corporation a perpetual  worldwide  royalty free  exclusive right and license to our flywheel technology for stationary  terrestrial applications 
beacon power was formed as a spin off of satcon technology corporation 
many of the us patents described above are the result of retaining ownership of inventions made under us government funded research and development programs 
as a qualifying small business  we have retained commercial ownership rights to proprietary technology developed under various us government contracts and grants  including small business innovation research contracts 
with respect to any invention made with government assistance  the government has a nonexclusive  nontransferable  irrevocable  paid up license to use the technology or have the technology employed for or on behalf of the us government throughout the world 
under certain conditions  the us government also has march in rights 
these rights enable the us government to require us to grant a nonexclusive  partially exclusive  or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applicants  upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances 
foreign operations we have foreign operations through our power systems  canada subsidiary in burlington  ontario  canada 
government regulation we presently are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to  among other things  export control energy generation  safe working conditions  handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere

government contracts we act as a prime contractor or major subcontractor for many different us government programs  including those that involve the development of electro mechanical transportation  navigation and energy related products 
over its lifetime  a program may be implemented by the award of many individual contracts and subcontracts  or contracts with option years  or partially funded contracts 
us government contracts include provisions permitting termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the us government s discretion 
the us government generally pays compensation for work actually done and commitments made at the time of termination  and some allowance for profit on the work performed 
the us government may also terminate for default in performance and pay only the value delivered to the us government 
it can also hold the contractor responsible for re procurement costs 
our government contract business is also subject to specific procurement statutes and regulations and a variety of socio economic and other factors 
failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to loss of contract or suspension or debarment from us government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
examples of these statutes and regulations are those related to procurement integrity  export control  employment practices  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
sales to the us government may be affected by changes in research interests in the areas in which we engage  changing government department budgets  and changing procurement policies 
employees at december   we had a total of full time employees  part time employees and contract employees 
of the total  persons were employed in engineering  in manufacturing  in administration and in sales and marketing 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  and on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
none of our employees are represented by a union 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
item a 
risk factors our future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
these factors include business conditions within the distributed power  power quality  aerospace  transportation  industrial  utility  telecommunications  silicon wafer manufacturing  factory automation  aircraft and automotive industries and the world economies as a whole 
our revenue growth is dependent  in part  on technology developments and contract research and development for both the government and commercial sectors and no assurance can be given that we will continue to obtain such funds 
in addition  our growth opportunities are dependent on our new products penetrating the distributed power  power quality  aerospace  transportation  industrial  utility  telecommunications  silicon wafer manufacturing  factory automation  aircraft and automotive markets 
no assurance can be given that new products can be developed  or if developed  will be commercially viable  that competitors will not force prices to unacceptably low levels or take market share from us  or that we can achieve and maintain profitability in these or any new markets 
because of these and other factors  including  without limitation  the factors set forth below  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the market price of our common stock experiences significant volatility 
risks related to our company we have a history of operating losses  may not be able to achieve profitability and may require additional capital in order to sustain our businesses 
for each of the past ten fiscal years  we have experienced losses from operating our businesses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
during the twelve months ended december  we had a loss from operations of approximately million 
in july  we sold senior secured convertible notes and related warrants for million 
the net proceeds of the sale were approximately million  after deducting placement fees and other offering related expenses 
if  however  we are unable to operate on a cash flow breakeven basis in the future  we may need to raise additional capital in order to sustain our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such results or to raise such funds if they are required 
we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements for the twelve months ended december   which are included in this annual report on form k  contain an audit report from vitale  caturano and company 
the audit report contains a going concern qualification  which raises substantial doubt with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
the receipt of a going concern qualification may create a concern among our current and future customers and vendors as to whether we will be able to fulfill our contractual obligations 
we could issue additional common stock  which might dilute the book value of our common stock 
we have authorized  shares of our common stock  of which  shares were issued and outstanding as of december  our board of directors has the authority  without action or vote of our stockholders in most cases  to issue all or a part of any authorized but unissued shares 
such stock issuances may be made at a price that reflects a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock 
in addition  in order to raise the capital that we may need at today s stock prices  we will need to issue securities that are convertible into or exercisable for a significant amount of our common stock 
for example  in july  we sold senior secured convertible notes and related warrants for million 
these issuances would dilute your percentage ownership interest  which will have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our stockholders vote  and might dilute the book value of our common stock 
you may incur additional dilution of net tangible book value if holders of stock options  whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted  exercise their options or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the sale or issuance of a large number of shares of our common stock could depress our stock price 
as of march   we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance upon exercise of stock options and warrants   shares for future issuances under our stock plans and  shares for future issuances as matching contributions under our k plan 
we have also reserved  shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the outstanding series b preferred stock  which can be converted at any time 
in addition  we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the outstanding notes  which can be converted at any time 
furthermore  because principal and interest may be paid in shares of common stock at a price per share equal to a discount to a volume weighted average price preceding the payment date  a significantly larger number of shares of common stock may be issued under the notes 
as of december   holders of warrants and options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock may exercise those securities and transfer the underlying common stock at any time subject  in some cases  to rule we have not consistently complied with nasdaq s marketplace rules for continued listing  which exposes us to the risk of delisting from the nasdaq stock market 
as a result of our failure to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global market  on october  we transferred our securities to the nasdaq capital market 
however  if we fail to maintain compliance with the rules for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market  including  without limitation  the minimum bid price requirement  and our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market  there could be a number of negative implications  including reduced liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with the nasdaq capital market  the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees  as well as the loss of analyst coverage and institutional investor interest  fewer business development opportunities and greater difficulty in obtaining financing 
in addition  if our common stock does not remain listed on a us national securities exchange  we may be required to repurchase our outstanding senior secured convertible notes at a premium and or incur liquidated damages 
in that event  we would likely have significant limitations on our ability to raise capital  including capital necessary in order to fund the repurchase of the senior secured convertible notes or pay the liquidated damages 
we expect to generate a significant portion of our future revenues from sales of our power control products and cannot assure market acceptance or commercial viability of our power control products 
we intend to continue to expand development of our power control products 
we cannot assure you that potential customers will select satcon s products to incorporate into their systems or that our customers products will realize market acceptance  that they will meet the technical demands of their end users or that they will offer cost effective advantages over existing products 
our marketing efforts have included development contracts with several customers and the targeting of specific market segments for power and energy management systems 
we cannot know if our commercial marketing efforts will be successful in the future 
additionally  we may not be able to develop competitive products  our products may not receive market acceptance  and we may not be able to compete profitably in this market  even if market acceptance is achieved 
if our products do not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial viability  we will not attain our anticipated levels of profitability and growth 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in design and manufacturing processes  we will not be able to successfully compete 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
as a result  we continually evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new product design and manufacturing processes 
we cannot  however  assure you that our process improvement efforts will be successful 
the introduction of new products embodying new technologies and the emergence of shifting customer demands or changing industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable  which would have a significant impact on our ability to generate revenue 
our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we may experience delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the future 
material delays in introducing new products or product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors 
we are heavily dependent on contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with the us government s prime contractors for revenue to develop our products  and the loss of one or more of our government contracts could preclude us from achieving our anticipated levels of growth and revenues 
our ability to develop and market our products is dependent upon maintaining our us government contract revenue and research grants 
many of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
approximately of our revenue during the twelve months ended december  was derived from government contracts and subcontracts 
changes in government policies  priorities or programs that result in budget reductions could cause the government to cancel existing contracts or eliminate follow on phases in the future which would severely inhibit our ability to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  once a government contract is completed  it will lead to follow on contracts for additional research and development  prototype build and test or production 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our us government contracts or subcontracts will not be terminated or suspended in the future 
in the event that any of our government contracts are terminated for cause  it could significantly affect our ability to obtain future government contracts  which could seriously harm our ability to develop our technologies and products 
our contracts with the us government are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency and other agencies of the government  which may challenge our treatment of direct and indirect costs and reimbursements  resulting in a material adjustment and adverse impact on our financial condition 
the accuracy and appropriateness of our direct and indirect costs and expenses under our contracts with the us government are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency or by other appropriate agencies of the us government 
these agencies have the right to challenge our cost estimates or allocations with respect to any such contract 
additionally  substantial portions of the payments to us under us government contracts are provisional payments that are subject to potential adjustment upon audit by such agencies 
adjustments that result from inquiries or audits of our contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
since our inception  we have not experienced any material adjustments as a result of any inquiries or audits  but there can be no assurance that our contracts will not be subject to material adjustments in the future 
the us government has certain rights relating to our intellectual property 
many of our patents are the result of inventions made under us government funded research and development programs 
with respect to any invention made with government assistance  the government has a nonexclusive  nontransferable  irrevocable  paid up license to use the technology or have the technology employed for or on behalf of the us government throughout the world 
under certain conditions  the us government also has march in rights  which enable the us government to require us to grant a nonexclusive  partially exclusive  or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applicants  upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary technology 
as of march   we held approximately us patents and had patent applications pending with the us patent and trademark office 
we have also obtained corresponding patents in the rest of north america  europe  and asia for many of these patents 
the expiration dates of our patents range from to  with the majority expiring after as a qualifying small business from our inception to date  we have retained commercial ownership rights to proprietary technology developed under various us government contracts and grants 
our patent and trade secret rights are of significant importance to us and to our future prospects 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our industry will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and systems designs relating to our products 
although we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be successful in doing so 
further  our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
no assurance can be given as to the issuance of additional patents or  if so issued  as to their scope 
patents granted may not provide meaningful protection from competitors 
even if a competitor s products were to infringe patents owned by us  it would be costly for us to pursue our rights in an enforcement action and there can be no assurance that we would be successful in enforcing our intellectual property rights 
because we intend to enforce our patents  trademarks and copyrights and protect our trade secrets  we may be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of these rights 
this litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert resources from operational goals 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country where we operate or sell our products 
we may not be able to maintain confidentiality of our proprietary knowledge 
in addition to our patent rights  we also rely on treatment of our technology as trade secrets through confidentiality agreements  which all of our employees are required to sign  assigning to us all patent rights and other intellectual property developed by our employees during their employment with us 
our employees have also agreed not to disclose any trade secrets or confidential information without our prior written consent 
we also rely on non disclosure agreement to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of these agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
failure to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and information could harm our results of operations and financial condition by reducing or eliminating our technological advantages in the marketplace 
others may assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights 
we believe that we do not infringe the proprietary rights of others and  to date  no third parties have asserted an infringement claim against us  but we may be subject to infringement claims in the future 
the defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time from our business operations 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement  we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay royalties to continue to use our technology 
we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or if these licenses are costly  our operating results may suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license third party technologies 
our success is dependent upon attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel and the loss of key personnel could significantly hurt our business 
to achieve success  we must attract and retain highly qualified technical  operational and executive employees 
the loss of the services of key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically engineering  operations and business development personnel  could result in the loss of business or could otherwise negatively impact our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
we expect significant competition for our products and services 
in the past  we have faced limited competition in providing research services  prototype development and custom and limited quantity manufacturing 
we expect competition to intensify greatly as commercial applications increase for our products under development 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are well established and have substantially greater financial  research and development  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are much larger than we are 
if these larger competitors decide to focus on the development of distributed power and power quality products  they have the manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities to complete research  development and commercialization of these products more quickly and effectively than we can 
there can also be no assurance that current and future competitors will not develop new or enhanced technologies perceived to be superior to those sold or developed by us 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this competitive environment 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for the supply of key components for our products 
we use third party suppliers for components in many of our systems 
from time to time  shipments can be delayed because of industry wide or other shortages of necessary materials and components from third party suppliers 
a supplier s failure to supply components in a timely manner  or to supply components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us  could impair our ability to deliver our products in accordance with contractual obligations 
on occasion  we agree to fixed price engineering contracts in our applied technology division  which exposes us to losses 
most of our engineering design contracts are structured on a cost plus basis 
however  on occasion we have entered into fixed price contracts  which may expose us to loss 
a fixed priced contract  by its very nature  requires cost estimates during the bidding process and throughout the contract  as the program proceeds to completion 
depending upon the complexity of the program  the estimated completion costs could change frequently and significantly during the course of the contract 
we regularly involve the appropriate people on the program and finance staffs to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the cost to complete 
however  due to unanticipated technical challenges and other factors  there is the potential for substantial cost overruns in order to complete the contract in accordance with the contract specifications 
currently we do not have any contracts of this type 
during the fiscal year ended september   we had recorded losses on these contracts of approximately million related to a fixed price contract which was completed during the period 
no other losses were recorded on these contracts during fiscal or if we experience a period of significant growth or expansion  it could place a substantial strain on our resources 
if our power control products are successful in achieving rapid market penetration  we may be required to deliver large volumes of technically complex products or components to our customers on a timely basis at reasonable costs to us 
we have limited experience in ramping up our manufacturing capabilities to meet large scale production requirements and delivering large volumes of our power control products 
if we were to commit to deliver large volumes of our power control products  we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy large scale commercial production on a timely and cost effective basis or that such growth will not strain our operational  financial and technical resources 
our business could be subject to product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims  which are inherent in the manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products  and we may face substantial liability for damages resulting from the faulty design or manufacture of products or improper use of products by end users 
we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance  and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim 
also  we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition 
in addition  negative publicity in connection with the faulty design or manufacture of our products would adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws that expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge or release of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of these materials 
these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource  conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as well as analogous state and foreign laws 
because we use hazardous materials in certain of our manufacturing processes  we are required to comply with these environmental laws 
in addition  because we generate hazardous wastes  we  along with any other person who arranges for the disposal of our wastes  may be subject to potential financial exposure for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if those sites become contaminated and even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws 
if we were found to be a responsible party  we could be held jointly and severably liable for the costs of remedial actions 
to date  we have not been cited for any improper discharge or release of hazardous materials 
businesses and consumers might not adopt alternative energy solutions as a means for obtaining their electricity and power needs 
on site distributed power generation solutions  such as fuel cell  photovoltaic and wind turbine systems  which utilize our products  provide an alternative means for obtaining electricity and are relatively new methods of obtaining electrical power that businesses may not adopt at levels sufficient to grow this part of our business 
traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility 
for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed  businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices and must be willing to rely upon less upon traditional means of purchasing electricity 
we cannot assure you that businesses and consumers will choose to utilize on site distributed power at levels sufficient to sustain our business in this area 
the development of a mass market for our products may be impacted by many factors which are out of our control  including market acceptance of fuel cell  photovoltaic and wind turbine systems that incorporate our products  the cost competitiveness of these systems  regulatory requirements  and the emergence of newer  more competitive technologies and products 
if a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate  we may be unable to recover the losses we will have incurred to develop these products 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our share price may decrease significantly 
our annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  our sales cycle for development work is relatively long and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed for the short term  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
if our earnings do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our stock could decline 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay  deter or prevent the acquisition of satcon  which could decrease the value of your shares 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of satcon or a change in our management that you  as a stockholder  may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and deter a takeover attempt  a board of directors with staggered  three year terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and limitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law and provisions in some of our stock incentive plans may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of satcon 
those provisions serve to limit the circumstances in which a premium may be paid for our common stock in proposed transactions  or where a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed  deterred or prevented  the market price of our common stock could suffer 
we are subject to stringent export laws and risks inherent in international operations 
we market and sell our products and services both inside and outside the united states 
we are currently selling our products and services throughout north america and in certain countries in south america  asia  canada and europe 
certain of our products are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations itar usc  which restricts the export of information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a foreign person 
additionally  certain products of ours are subject to export regulations administered by the department of commerce  bureau of industry security  which require that we obtain an export license before we can export certain products or technology 
failure to comply with these laws could result in enforcement responses by the government  including substantial monetary penalties  denial of export privileges  debarment from government contracts and possible criminal sanctions 
revenue from sales to our international customers for the year ended december   the three month transition period ended december  and our fiscal year ended september   were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to expand our market for our products and services to foreign customers and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements 
we have limited experience developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets 
we face numerous challenges in penetrating international markets  including unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  longer accounts receivable cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  and the challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
we are exposed to credit risks with respect to some of our customers 
to the extent our customers do not advance us sufficient funds to finance our costs during the execution phase of our contracts  we are exposed to the risk that they will be unable to accept delivery or that they will be unable to make payment at the time of delivery 
occasionally  we accept the risk of dealing with thinly financed entities 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to negotiate more timely progress payments and utilizing other risk management procedures 
the holders of our series b preferred stock are entitled to receive liquidation payments in preference to the holders of our common stock 
as of march   shares of our series b preferred stock were outstanding 
pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation creating the series b preferred stock  upon a liquidation of our company  the holders of shares of the series b preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to the shares of our common stock 
the amount of this preferential liquidation payment is  per share of series b preferred stock  plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares 
prior to october   dividends accrued on the shares of series b preferred stock at a rate of per annum 
on october   dividends began accruing on the series b preferred stock at a rate of per annum 
risks related to our private placement of senior secured convertible notes and warrants substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flows 
in connection with the sale of our senior secured convertible notes in july  we incurred new indebtedness of million of which million is out standing as of march  
as a result of this indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations increased substantially 
the degree to which we are leveraged could  among other things require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources to debt service  to the extent we are unable to make payments of principal and interest in common stock  due to  among other things failure to satisfy the equity conditions that must be met to enable us to do so  make it difficult for us to obtain necessary financing in the future for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes on favorable terms  if at all  make it more difficult for us to be acquired  make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we could be required to make substantial cash payments upon an event of default or change of control under our senior secured convertible notes and related warrants  and  because the notes are secured  holders of the notes could take action against our assets upon an event of default 
our senior secured convertible notes provide for events of default including  among others  payment defaults  cross defaults  breaches of any representation  warranty or covenant that is not cured within the proper time periods  failure to perform certain required activities in a timely manner  our common stock no longer being listed on an eligible market  the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part lapses beyond a specified period and certain bankruptcy type events involving us or any significant subsidiary 
upon an event of default  the holders of the notes may elect to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the notes for a purchase price equal to the greater of i of such outstanding principal amount  plus all accrued but unpaid interest or ii of the then value of the underlying common stock 
in addition  under the terms of the notes and warrants  upon a change of control of our company  i the holders of the notes may elect to require us to purchase the notes for of the outstanding principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest and ii the holders of the warrants may elect to require us to purchase the warrants for a purchase price equal to the black scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of each warrant 
if either an event of default or change of control occurs  our available cash could be seriously depleted and our ability to fund operations could be materially harmed 
furthermore  because the notes are secured  if an event of default occurs  the holders of the notes may take action against our assets including the stock of our subsidiaries under the terms of a security agreement 
we are responsible for having the resale of shares of common stock underlying the convertible notes and warrants issued in our july private placement registered with the sec within defined time periods and will incur liquidated damages if the shares are not registered with the sec within those defined time periods 
pursuant to our agreement with the investors in the july private placement  we were obligated to i file a registration statement covering the resale of the common stock underlying the securities issued in the private placement with the sec within days following the closing of the private placement which we have satisfied  ii use our best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within days following the closing of the private placement which we have satisfied  as the registration statement was declared effective on september  and iii use our best efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the earlier of x the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement  y the date all of the securities covered by the registration statement have been publicly sold and z the date all of the securities covered by the registration statement may be sold without restriction under sec rule k 
if we fail to comply with these or certain other provisions  then we will be required to pay liquidated damages of of the aggregate purchase price paid by the investors in the private placement for the initial occurrence of such failure and of such amount for each subsequent day period the failure continues 
the total liquidated damages under this provision are capped at of the aggregate purchase price paid by the investors in the private placement 
any such payments could materially affect our ability to fund operations 
the agreements governing the senior secured convertible notes and related warrants contain various covenants and restrictions which may limit our ability to operate our business 
the agreements governing the senior secured convertible notes and related warrants contain various covenants and restrictions  including  among others for so long as the notes are outstanding  the obligation that we offer to the holders the opportunity to participate in subsequent securities offerings up to of such offerings  subject to certain exceptions for  among other things  certain underwritten public offerings and strategic alliances  for so long as the notes are outstanding  the obligation that we not incur any indebtedness that is senior to  or on parity with  the notes in right of payment  subject to limited exceptions for purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations  for so long as the notes are outstanding  we must maintain aggregate cash and cash equivalents equal to the greater of i  or ii  minus of eligible receivables  and for so long as the notes and warrants are outstanding  we may not issue any common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the conversion price 
these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business

as discussed below  in connection with an amendment to the purchase agreement enabling us to issue common stock for the early termination of the lease for our worcester facility  the expiration date of the warrant b s was extended to august  the net proceeds of the sale were approximately million  after deducting placement fees and other offering related expenses 
in connection with the private placement  we also entered into a security agreement  dated july   with the purchasers the security agreement 
in addition  first albany capital fac acted as placement agent in connection with the private placement 
in addition to a cash transaction fee of  fac or its designees were entitled to receive five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the discretion of fac  these warrants were issued to first albany companies  inc  the parent of fac 
we also paid ardour capital  our financial advisor  approximately  for its services related to the private placement 
in connection with  and as a condition precedent to  the completion of the private placement  on july   we paid all amounts due and owing under our credit facility with silicon valley bank approximately million and terminated such facility 
in doing so we incurred a termination fee of  and legal fees of  see note g to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a detailed description of the notes and related warrants 
on september   our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from september to december as a result  the financial periods presented and discussed in this annual report on form k will be defined as follows year ended december  represents the twelve months ended december   three month transition period ended december  represents the three months ended december   fiscal year ended september  represents the twelve month period ended september   and fiscal year ended september  represents the twelve month period ended september  for purposes of our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we will be comparing the following periods twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended september  three months ended december  compared to the three months ended january  unaudited twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  on september   our board of directors approved a plan to close our worcester  massachusetts manufacturing facility by approximately december  the decision to close this facility was in furtherance of our continuing efforts to streamline operations and reduce our operating costs 
we intend to focus spending on our renewable energy business 
as a result of this decision  we incurred approximately million related to employee severance and retention bonuses and asset impairments  warrant revaluation and lease termination costs 
on december   we negotiated a settlement with the worcester landlord  issuing  shares of common stock on january  as consideration for the early termination of the lease 
the lease terminated on february  we currently expect this action will result in a reduction of total overhead expenses of rent  facilities and personnel costs of approximately million per year 
on december   in connection with the early termination of the lease for the worcester facility  we entered into a first amendment to securities purchase agreement the amendment with certain of the purchasers who participated in the private placement 
pursuant to the amendment the definition of excluded stock set forth in the purchase agreement was amended to enable us to issue up to million shares of our common stock in connection with the early termination of the lease for our facility located in worcester  massachusetts  without such shares being subject to the purchasers right of participation set forth in the purchase agreement and certain prohibitions set forth in the notes and related warrants as noted above  we ultimately settled the lease for  shares  and we agreed to extend the expiration date of the warrant b s issued in the private placement from may  to august  overview we design and manufacture enabling technologies and products for electrical power conversion and control for high performance  high efficiency applications in large  growth markets such as alternative energy  hybrid electric vehicles  distributed power generation  power quality  semiconductor fabrication capital equipment  industrial motors and drives  and high reliability defense electronics 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  receivable reserves  inventory reserves  investment in beacon power corporation  goodwill and intangible assets  contract losses and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our audit committee 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable 
title to the product passes upon shipment of the product  as the products are typically shipped fob shipping point  except for certain foreign shipments 
if the product requires installation to be performed by us  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
if the product requires specific customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse  unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
when appropriate  we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized 
we perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and  in some situations  the payment of a fee 
these contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget 
on fixed price contracts  revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract 
revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed 
in each type of contract  we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
adjustments are recognized in the period made 
the defense contract audit agency has agreed upon the final indirect cost rates for the fiscal year ended september  when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
as of december   and  we have accrued approximately and million  respectively  for anticipated contract losses 
cost of product revenue includes material  labor and overhead 
costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses 
deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed  product shipped or installation completed 
unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand  as well as based on historical usage 
due to the custom and specific nature of certain of our products  demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
at the end of june  we were actively engaged in selling our shaker product line  and we were pursuing a strategy that we hoped would lead to a strategic alliance with a larger company for the development and exploitation of the advantages embodied in our uninterruptible power supply ups system 
at that time the gross inventory for our shaker product line inventory totaled approximately million and our valuation reserve against that inventory was million  or 
in addition  we had originally accrued approximately million for purchase commitments related to the ups and shaker product lines see note d to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the table below details the resulting approximate reduction of costs related to both the inventory reserves of our shaker and ups product lines  as well as reserves established related to the purchase commitments as follows year value of inventory reserve used value of purchase commitments reserve used period reduction to cost of sales cumulative reduction to cost of sales fiscal year three months ended december  year ended december  although it is unclear how much of the remaining inventory we will sell and during which periods it will occur  as we sell this inventory our cost of product revenue will be lower than normal as this inventory has been largely written down 
as a result  to the extent this inventory is sold in the future  our margins will be favorably impacted compared with results that would otherwise be achieved 
on december   we sold our shaker and amplifier product lines  and the associated inventory and intellectual property to qualmark  inc  for proceeds of approximately million 
this sale involved shaker and amplifier inventory of approximately million 
this inventory had approximately million in reserves  due to the fiscal write down as described above 
remaining reserves related to the fiscal write down  as described above  relate only to our ups inventory and will be accounted for in future sales of these products 
goodwill and intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
values were assigned to goodwill and intangible assets based on third party independent valuations  as well as management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement affects our treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement requires impairment tests be periodically repeated and on an interim basis  if certain conditions exist  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
additionally  existing goodwill and intangible assets must be assessed and classified within the statement s criteria 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over those periods 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives ceased 
we determine the fair value of each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow income approach 
the income approach indicates the fair value of a business enterprise based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future 
this analysis is largely based upon projections prepared by us and data from sources of publicly available information available at the time of preparation 
these projections are based on management s best estimate of future results 
in making these projections  we consider the markets we are addressing  the competitive environment and our advantages 
there will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected  and those differences may be material 
in addition  we perform a macro assessment of the overall likelihood that we would achieve the projected cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis using historical data as the basis for projected cash flows 
long lived assets we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for possible impairment  if certain conditions exist  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
we determine the fair value of certain of the long lived assets based on a discounted cash flow income approach 
the income approach indicates the fair value of a long lived assets based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the long lived asset can be expected to generate in the future over the life of the long lived asset 
this analysis is based upon projections prepared by us 
these projections represent management s best estimate of future results 
in making these projections  we consider the markets we are addressing  the competitive environment and our advantages 
there will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected  and those differences may be material 
in addition  we perform a macro assessment of the overall likelihood that we would achieve the projected cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis using historical data as the basis for projected cash flows 
convertible debt instruments and warrant liabilities we account for our senior secured convertible notes and associated warrants in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our convertible notes include features that qualify as embedded derivatives  such as i the holders conversion option  ii our option to settle the notes at the scheduled dates in cash or shares of our common stock  and iii premiums and penalties we would be liable to pay in the event of default 
as permitted under sfas  we have elected  as of january   to measure the notes in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either gain or loss 
this election was made by us after determining that the aggregate fair value of the notes to be more meaningful in the context of our financial statements than if separate fair values were assigned to each of the multiple embedded instruments contained such notes 
we record interest expense under our convertible notes based on the greater of i or ii the six month libor  in effect at the time plus basis points  as well as the amortization of the debt discount  which we compute using the effective interest method 
the debt discount represents the difference between our gross proceeds of million and the fair value of the convertible debt upon issuance  after separately valuing the investor warrants  the placement agent warrants and the convertible notes on a relative fair value basis 
by amortizing the debt discount to interest expense  rather than recognizing it as a change in fair value of the convertible debt instrument and warrants  which is a separate line item in our statement of operations  we believe our interest expense line item more appropriately reflects the cost of the debt associated with our convertible notes 
we determined the fair values of our convertible notes  investor warrants and placement agent warrants in consultation with valuation specialists  using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of our convertible notes and our warrants 
an increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of both convertible notes and warrants to increase  because the conversion and exercise prices  respectively  of such instruments are fixed at and per share  respectively  and result in a charge to our statement of operations 
a decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the convertible notes and the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations 
if the price of our common stock were to decline significantly  however  the decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes would be limited by the instrument s debt characteristics 
under such circumstances  our estimated cost of capital would become another significant variable affecting the fair value of the convertible notes 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
sfas simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas and sfas sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after september  we adopted sfas on january  we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of fin no 
on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued fiancial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas in september  the sec released sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab allows registrants to adjust for the cumulative effect of certain errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption provided that management has properly concluded that the errors were not material to prior periods 
sab also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented 
such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the sec to be amended 
we have adopted the provisions of sab and determined that the impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows not to be material

these decreases in our power systems  us product line revenue were offset in part by increases in other product lines of approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended september  we shipped a rotary ups to a customer and have deferred approximately million in revenue until all elements of revenue recognition are achieved 
in fiscal we recognized revenue of approximately million related to a rups unit sale for which revenue recognition was deferred in the prior year 
the electronics division remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year 
funded research and development and other revenue 
funded research and development and other revenue decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to less overall business in our applied technology division  delays in starting up several existing contracts  a decrease in revenue of million from a naval program which existed in fiscal  and a decrease in revenue of million from a contract with general atomics to deliver power converter and control assemblies for the rv triton  a british research vessel  combined with efforts focused on completing the contract with edo corporation in the first and second quarters of fiscal  which took away from our ability to work on other opportunities 
the edo program was completed and delivered during the second quarter of fiscal  and during our fourth quarter ended september  the customer accepted all elements previously delivered by us and we have included approximately million in revenue offset by approximately million in costs during the period

gross margins on product revenue decreased from for the fiscal year ended september  to for the fiscal year ended september  gross margin by division is broken out below 
fiscal year ended division september  september  power systems  us power systems  canada electronics total gross margin in our power systems  us division  the decrease in gross margin by is a direct result of the product mix for the year as compared to the same period in fiscal  along with higher materials costs and continued manufacturing inefficiencies 
our gross margins in our power systems  canada division remained consistent as compared to the same period in in our electronics division  the decrease in gross margins by was attributable to the sales mix consisting of lower margin business in conjunction with manufacturing efficiencies and higher materials costs 
funded research and development and other revenue expenses 
funded research and development and other revenue expenses decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year a primary reason for the decrease was directly related to efforts focused on the completion of the edo contract and less overall business 
the gross margin on funded research and other revenue declined from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the primary reason for the decline in gross margin is directly related to our efforts in completing the edo contract which led to lower efficiency levels of our staff due to the slower start up of new programs and the edo contract which resulted in approximately million in revenues offset by approximately million in deferred costs  resulting in no margin 
unfunded research and development expenses 
we expended approximately million on unfunded research and development in fiscal year and a minimal amount in fiscal year funds were expended in in order to facilitate new product development and modifications and enhancements to existing products in our electronics and power systems divisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses

amortization of intangibles remained flat at million for the fiscal years ended september  and gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets held for sale of approximately million consisted of the receipt of payment related to the sale of our splc technology in  for which we deferred recognition until payments were received 
restructuring costs 
we recorded a reduction in accrued restructuring costs of  during fiscal this reduction was a direct result of our determining that the remaining balance was no longer warranted 
see note t 
to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
write off of long lived assets 
we recorded a million charge representing an impairment in the carrying value of the long lived assets in our worcester  massachusetts manufacturing facility 
based in large part on our recent history  we prepared a cash flow forecast of the worcester facility s product lines over four and a half years  the then remaining life of our lease on the facility 
based on these cash flow projections we did not expect to recoup the value of our long lived assets in our power systems worcester division 
the assets evaluated  before the write down  approximate a net book value of million and are comprised primarily of leasehold improvements and plant equipment 
given this situation  we performed a fair market analysis of these assets and determined that a million charge was required in our fiscal fourth quarter representing an impairment of these long lived assets

quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended december  this data has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this data includes all adjustments  consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments  which we believe necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
the historical quarterly data for the quarters ended january   april  and july  have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of amounts previously accounted for as cost of product sales to un funded research and development expenses

in addition  under the terms of the notes  we are required  for so long as any notes are outstanding  to maintain aggregate cash and cash equivalents equal to the greater of i million or ii million minus of eligible receivables as defined therein 
based on the level of eligible receivables  we are required to maintain aggregate cash and cash equivalents of million 
on july   we entered into a purchase agreement with the purchasers in connection with the private placement of  aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes  convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  warrant a s to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for a period beginning six months from the date of such warrants and ending on the seventh anniversary of the date of such warrants  and warrant b s to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for a period of trading days beginning the later of six months from the date of such warrants and the date the sec declares effective the registration statement covering the resale of the common stock underlying the securities issued in the private placement  to the extent the warrant b s are exercised  the purchasers will receive additional seven year warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to of the number of shares of common stock purchased upon exercise of the warrant b s at a price of per share 
because the registration statement was declared effective on september   these warrants were originally exercisable for the trading day period beginning six months from the date of such warrants ie may  
as discussed above  in connection with an amendment to the purchase agreement enabling us to issue common stock for the early termination of the lease for our worcester facility  the expiration date of the warrant b s was extended to august  the net proceeds of the sale were approximately million  after deducting placement fees and other offering related expenses 
in connection with the private placement  we also entered into the security agreement 
we anticipate that our current cash will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december  this assumes that we will achieve our business plan and that we will be able to pay principal and interest under the notes in shares of common stock and comply with all other terms of the notes 
the business plan envisions a significant increase in revenue and significant reductions in the cost structure and the cash burn rate from the results experienced in the recent past 
if  however  we are unable to realize our business plan  or are unable to pay principal and interest under the notes in shares of common stock or otherwise comply with the terms of the notes  we may be forced to raise additional funds by selling stock or taking other actions to conserve our cash position  subject to the restrictions in the purchase agreement and the notes 
if additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
the terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially  adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial statements for our year ended december   which are included in this annual report on form k  contain an audit report from vitale  caturano and company  pc 
the audit report contains a going concern qualification  which raises substantial doubt with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
however  our business plan  which envisions a significant improvement in results from the recent past  contemplates sufficient liquidity to fund operations at least through december  the receipt of a going concern qualification may create a concern among our current and future customers and vendors as to whether we will be able to fulfill our contractual obligations 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products 
these costs have exceeded total revenue 
as a result  we have incurred losses in each of the past five years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt  public security offerings  borrowings under our previous line of credit and capital equipment leases 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  including restricted cash and cash equivalents of million  this represents decrease in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately million from the million on hand at december  cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to million for the twelve months ended september  cash used in operating activities during the twelve months ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately million offset by non cash items such as the change in the fair value of the senior secured convertible notes and placement agent fees  depreciation and amortization  deferred revenue  increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory  non cash compensation and consulting expense  non cash interest expense and decreases in working capital 
cash used in investing activities during the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to million for the twelve months september  cash used in investing activities during the fiscal years ended december  and september   was a result of capital expenditures during each of the respective periods 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended december  we recorded approximately million related to the sale of our splc technology 
cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to million for the twelve months ended september  net cash provided by financing activities during includes million of net proceeds from the july  private placement  and approximately million received from the exercise of incentive stock options and warrants to purchase common stock  offset in part by approximately million related to payments on our capital lease obligations and million related to payments on our bank line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal includes million of net proceeds from the december financing transaction  million of net proceeds from the august financing transaction and approximately million received from the exercise of incentive stock options  offset in part by approximately million related to payments on our capital lease obligations 
payments due under contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods calendar years ending december  capital leases operating leases long term debt thereafter total long term debt consists of scheduled principal and interest payments on our notes 
principal is payable in equal installments  which represents of the notes  with the remaining  at the election of the investor  is either i due on the th month or ii due on the th month 
principal payments  representing of the notes  commenced on february  the notes accrue interest at the greater of i or ii six month libor plus basis points 
at december  the six month libor was 
for purposes of the schedule above  interest for all periods has been calculated using the december  six month libor plus basis points as this rate was greater than 
principal and interest may be paid  at our option  in cash of shares of our common stock 
because investors may convert principal into common stock at any time  at their option  the timing of principal and interest payments may accelerate relative to this schedule 
we lease equipment and office space under non cancelable capital and operating leases 
the future minimum rental payments  as of december   under the capital and operating leases with non cancelable terms are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risks disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our financing activities 
at december   million was outstanding on the notes 
interest on the notes accrues at a rate equal to the greater of i per annum or ii the six month libor plus basis points  currently 
our ability to carry out our business plan or our ability to finance future working capital requirements may be impacted if the cost of carrying debt fluctuates to the point where it becomes a burden on our resources 
we account for the notes and warrant liability on a fair value basis  and changes in share price and market interest rates will affect our earnings but will not affect our cash flows  assuming that we are able to make interest payments due on the notes in shares of our common stock 
foreign currency risk nearly all of our sales outside the united states are priced in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthens versus local currencies  it may result in our products becoming more expensive in foreign markets 
in addition  approximately of our costs are incurred in foreign currencies  especially the canadian dollar 
if the us dollar weakens versus these local currencies  it may result in an increase in our cost structure
