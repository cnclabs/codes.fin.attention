item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiary 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases and disorders of the central nervous system cns 
we currently own and market two commercial cns products  hp acthar gel acthar and doral 
we acquired the rights to doral quazepam in the united states in may acthar repository corticotropin injection is an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of a wide range of conditions with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also used in treating patients with infantile spasm  an epileptic syndrome 
doral is indicated for the treatment of insomnia  characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings  which occurs frequently in patients with cns diseases and disorders 
we announced our cns strategy in april as part of this strategy  we are pursuing the development of new products that have the potential to address unmet medical needs in the cns field as well as the licensing and acquisition of additional cns commercial products and product candidates 
we have achieved the following objectives since we initiated our cns strategy divested our non cns product lines to provide capital to expand our business and improve our capital structure  improved our capital structure by eliminating our outstanding debt and series b convertible preferred stock  expanded our sales organization to effectively cover the nationwide audience of physicians who are current and potential high prescribers of products that treat cns disorders  acquired doral  a commercial product indicated for the treatment of insomnia  filed a supplemental new drug application with the fda seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms  announced a new clinical development program  qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain  and achieved an increase of over in net sales of our lead product acthar in as compared to a significant step in our cns focused strategy was the sale of our non cns pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  ethamolin and glofil in october which resulted in net proceeds of million 
this transaction provided us with capital to help us improve our capital structure  expand our national sales organization  expand our cns product portfolio  and fund our on going operations 
using proceeds from the sale of our non cns product lines  during  we retired million in debt and  in january  we redeemed all of our outstanding series b convertible preferred stock for million 
as a result of these transactions we no longer have any financial instruments that require interest or dividend payments or 
table of contents contain restrictive operating covenants 
our interest and dividends under these arrangements totaled  and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have also expanded our sales organization from field based sales representatives and sales management personnel when we announced our cns strategy in april to our current position field based sales organization 
our field based sales organization extends throughout the us to effectively cover the nationwide audience of physicians who are current and potential high prescribers of acthar  doral and other products that treat cns disorders 
the expansion of our sales organization allows us to concentrate more resources on our promotion of acthar and doral and provides the initial sales infrastructure to promote cns products we may acquire  develop  or co promote in the future 
in may  we completed the acquisition of doral from medpointe healthcare inc medpointe 
as consideration for the rights to doral in the united states  we paid medpointe million in cash upon the closing of the transaction and million in december  after the approval of an alternative source to manufacture and supply the active ingredient for doral 
we believe that doral has a number of unique properties that make it an attractive option for the many neurology patients who suffer from sleep disturbance 
doral had never been promoted directly to neurologists prior to our acquisition of the product and our national sales force has begun to capitalize on its attractive therapeutic profile 
in august  the fda accepted for review our supplemental new drug application seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms 
although our fda approved package labeling for acthar does not mention infantile spasm  acthar has been used to treat this condition 
we anticipate that the fda will take action on the snda during the second quarter of no drug is currently approved in the united states for the treatment of infantile spasms 
in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain 
the initiation of this development program represents an important milestone in our evolution into a leading cns focused specialty pharmaceutical company 
we believe that qsc could fill a critical gap in the treatment of pain 
neurologists prescribe pain medication for a large number of their patients  particularly those with ms  headache  chronic pain  and spinal lesions 
for the subset of individuals who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc could represent a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
net sales of acthar were million for the year ended december   an increase of over net sales of million for the year ended december  we believe that our focused sales and marketing efforts were the key factor contributing to this increase 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock to unaffiliated institutional investors at a purchase price of per share and  shares of our common stock to certain insiders at a purchase price of per share 
the net offering proceeds were approximately million after deducting placement agency fees and offering expenses 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
we believe we are well positioned to increase demand for acthar and doral  invest in additional currently marketed products  and add new development programs as we further our goal of building a leading cns focused specialty pharmaceutical company 
we have registered trademarks on hp acthar gel and doral 
we also have an unregistered trademark on emitasol tm  an intranasal form of metoclopromide  which is an antiemetic 
each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
we believe our trademarks  trade names and service marks have value and play an important role in our marketing efforts 
our corporate office is located at whipple road  union city  california and our telephone number is our corporate internet address is www

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 

table of contents strategy we believe that our ability to focus our promotional  product acquisition and product development efforts exclusively on the development and commercialization of products that treat cns diseases and disorders positions us for growth 
the key elements of our strategy include increase sales of acthar and doral through targeted promotion 
we seek to increase sales of acthar and doral by promoting to the nationwide audience of physicians who are current and potential high prescribers of acthar and doral through our expanded sales organization 
license  acquire  or co promote additional commercial products 
we seek to license  acquire  or co promote additional commercial products that will i benefit from increased marketing efforts directed at neurologists and other related healthcare providers  ii leverage our existing sales infrastructure  iii complement our therapeutic focus on neurology  and iv ultimately improve our operating results 
develop  acquire  or license new or improved formulations of prescription products 
we seek to develop  acquire or license new or improved formulations of prescription products that will i complement our target therapeutic area and sales strategy and ii require lower capital investment when compared to traditional pre clinical development programs 
we intend to fund our strategic activities with cash generated from operations  capital raised through the sale of equity on terms acceptable to us  corporate collaborations  or debt financings 
hp acthar gel hp acthar gel is a natural source  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth  which we acquired in july unlike synthetic acth  acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
it works by stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete the natural endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
acthar is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the treatment of periodic flares associated with ms  infantile spasm is  and various forms of arthritis collectively called joint pain 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience painful  episodic flares 
we promote acthar as an alternative to intravenous methylprednisolone  a corticosteroid  for the treatment of exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is the most common treatment of choice for this indication 
the primary advantage of acthar in this setting is that it provides the patient with the freedom and convenience of intramuscular or subcutaneous administration at home  rather than the intravenous administration of methylprednisolone in an infusion clinic setting  without sacrificing efficacy or tolerability 
acthar has over fifty other labeled indications and uses in certain endocrine disorders  rheumatic disorders  collagen diseases  allergic states  ophthalmic diseases  respiratory diseases  hematologic disorders  neoplastic diseases  edematous states  and gastrointestinal diseases 
although the fda approved package labeling does not mention is  acthar has historically been used to treat this condition 
a symposium on is  sponsored by the child neurology society  discussed the fact that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
the proceedings of that symposium have been made available to all pediatric neurologists as a continuing medical education monograph 
in august  the fda accepted for review our supplemental new drug application seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms 
we anticipate that the fda will take action on the snda during the second quarter of no drug is currently approved in the us for the treatment of infantile spasms 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasm generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy 
table of contents to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the market for is therapies has not changed much over the last several years 
acthar remains the treatment of choice  however  acthar s availability in the several years before our acquisition of the drug from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  now zlb behring was very restricted 
as such  many physicians used synthetic steroids and unapproved products 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteroids  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasm and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
solu medrol is the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms flares 
for the years ended december   and  net product sales of acthar were million  million and million  respectively 
doral in may  we purchased the rights in the united states to doral from medpointe pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement agreement 
doral is a commercial product indicated for the treatment of insomnia  characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
sleep disturbance and insomnia is a very common side effect of many neurological diseases and disorders such as ms  epilepsy  parkinson s disease  and alzheimer s disease and is a critical concern of our targeted physicians 
we believe that doral complements our efforts to expand the prescribing of acthar and allows us to significantly leverage our national neurology sales organization 
the overall us market for sleep medicines has seen significant growth over the past several years and is estimated to have generated over billion in prescription drug sales in the prescribing by our target physicians was estimated at over million in which was an increase of nearly from we believe that doral has a number of unique properties that make it an attractive option for the many neurology patients who suffer from sleep disturbance 
doral had never been promoted directly to neurologists prior to our acquisition of the product and our national sales force has begun to capitalize on its attractive therapeutic profile 
doral is the second branded prescription product to be marketed by our national sales organization and further validates our strategy to focus on becoming a leading cns focused specialty pharmaceutical company 
we made a million cash payment on the transaction closing date and a second cash payment of million related to the fda s approval of an alternative source to manufacture and supply the active ingredient quazepam for doral 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we acquired all finished goods inventories of doral existing at the closing date and assumed an obligation to pay a royalty to ivax research  inc ivax on net sales of doral 
in january  we made a cash payment of  to ivax to eliminate the royalty obligation 
medpointe is obligated for all product returns  medicaid rebates  and chargebacks on sales of doral prior to the closing date 
we entered into a separate supply agreement with medpointe to supply doral for an initial term of three years 
the supply agreement may be extended for an additional term of three years upon the written consent of both parties prior to the end of the initial term 
we accounted for the doral product acquisition as an asset purchase and allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired 
we attributed million  which included acquisition costs of  to purchased technology and  to inventory 
purchased technology is being amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years  the expected life of the doral product rights 
we commenced shipments in late may and re launched doral in the third quarter of net product sales of doral were  for the period may through december product development our strategy focuses on the acquisition  development  and co promotion of products that treat cns disorders 
we intend to develop new or improved formulations of prescription products that complement our target therapeutic area of neurology and that may provide more convenient dosing  improved compliance  more consistent blood levels  and easier administration 
we expect our development programs will involve development collaborators and will require lower capital investment when compared to traditional pre clinical development programs 

table of contents in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet odt formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen hb apap for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain 
qsc is being formulated by eurand and would utilize eurand s proprietary microcaps taste masking and advatab tm odt technologies 
we own the world wide rights to commercialize qsc and eurand would exclusively supply the product and receive a royalty on product sales 
hb apap  in its variety of strengths  is one of the most frequently prescribed products in the us with over million prescriptions written in according to a third party provider of prescription data 
hb apap is one of the five most frequently prescribed products by neurologists  who accounted for over one million prescriptions in there are currently no odt formulations of hb apap available in the united states 
the successful initiation of this clinical development program represents an important milestone in our evolution into a leading cns focused specialty pharmaceutical company 
we believe that qsc could fill a critical gap in the treatment of pain 
neurologists prescribe pain medication for a large number of their patients  particularly those with ms  headache  chronic pain  and spinal lesions 
for the many individuals who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc represents a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
eurand would receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development milestones 
advatab tm can be combined with eurand s microcaps taste masking technology to provide an odt with a pleasant taste 
in addition  advatab tm tablets dissolve rapidly in the mouth within to seconds  and the smooth mixture of carrier excipients and taste masked drug granules is suitable for delivering high drug doses 
modified release drug granules can also be incorporated into the advatab tm dosage form to provide a fast dissolve tablet with sustained release properties 
advatab tm tablets can be packaged in either bottles or blisters 
eurand is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and commercializes enhanced pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products based on its proprietary drug formulation technologies 
since  eurand has had four products approved by the fda  three resulting from co development partnerships 
eurand has a pipeline of products in development both for its co development partners and its proprietary portfolio 
eurand s technology platforms include bioavailability enhancement of poorly soluble drugs  customized release  taste masking fast dissolving formulations  and drug conjugation 
eurand is an established business with manufacturing and research facilities in the us  italy and france 
we also own other non core technology  much of which we have licensed to others for further development and commercialization 
we have licensed our antiviral drug discovery program to rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel 
we may receive milestone payments or royalties should rigel progress development and ultimately commercialize products using the licensed technology 
however  to date  we have not received any milestone or royalty payments and there can be no assurance that we will receive any such payments in the future 
we have no current plans to further develop emitasol 
however  emitasol was developed and approved for marketing in certain countries outside of the us by corporate partners 
we may receive royalties to the extent of any sales of emitasol by our corporate partners 
however  to date  royalty payments on sales of emitasol have been minimal and there can be no assurance that we will receive any such payments in the future 
our research and development expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
manufacturing our products are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
this transfer was approved by the fda in january our agreement with cbl extends through in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which terminates on december  and includes two one year extension options 

table of contents while we have received approval for the acthar finished vials and api transfers to new contract manufacturers  the processes used to manufacture and test acthar are complex and subject to fda inspection and approval 
acthar has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
we have selected a contract laboratory to perform two bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
these bioassays have been successfully transferred from aventis now zlb behring to the contract laboratory  and were approved by the fda in june we experienced delays and cost overruns in the transfer and validation of a third assay  potency 
zlb behring initially agreed to perform any potency assays we required through in february  we extended our agreement with zlb behring through and terminated the potency assay transfer project 
the transfer of manufacturing of acthar from aventis to our new contract manufacturers is resulting in higher unit costs than the fixed price manufacturing agreement with aventis 
we entered into a separate supply agreement with medpointe for doral with an initial term of three years 
our agreement with medpointe calls for medpointe to procure the raw materials and manufacture and package doral 
the supply agreement may be extended for an additional term of three years upon the written consent of both parties prior to the end of the initial term 
doral has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
the api used in doral is procured by medpointe from a third party supplier 
a new manufacturer of the api was approved by the fda in november future doral lots manufactured by medpointe will be produced using this new source of api 
there can be no assurance that any of our api or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness 
also  there can be no assurance our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all of the fda s current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of api or our finished products  or for the manufacture of products that we may acquire or develop  may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
divested product lines in connection with our focused cns strategy  on october  we sold our non cns pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  ethamolin and glofil nascobal is a prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin is an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and glofil is an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function 
our net product sales of the divested product lines were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
effective october   our results of operations and cash flows excluded the net product sales and direct operating costs and expenses of the divested product lines 
because the divested product lines were part of a larger cash flow generating group and did not represent a separate operation  the divested product lines were not reported as discontinued operations 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing organization is comprised of field based sales positions  field based sales management positions and home office sales and marketing positions to support the commercialization of acthar and doral 
our sales and marketing organization has significant experience in the pharmaceutical industry  with much of the organization also having significant experience in neurology 
our promotion and educational efforts are focused on pediatric neurologists and on a subset of high potential neurologists dedicated to the treatment of multiple sclerosis in adults 

table of contents we do not have substantial operations outside the us acthar is approved for sale in the us and we have the us rights to doral 
however  we also have agreements with the following companies to market and distribute acthar on a named patient basis in certain other countries 
beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
we have an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
beacon of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
gross sales to beacon were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
idis limited we have an agreement with idis limited idis of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia and new zealand  and the uk  where acthar is sold through beacon 
gross sales to idis were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with our products 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition and commercialization of products 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that we may develop  should they be approved  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
see item a risk factors risks relating to our business if competitors develop and market products that are more effective than ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated for a discussion of additional risks related to competition 
government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products all pharmaceutical operations associated with the production  testing  packaging and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 

table of contents drug products must be manufactured  tested  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt any pharmaceutical operations that are not in compliance with cgmps 
the fda may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
in march we received a drug class action letter from the fda requesting modifications in the labeling and patient instructions for all drug products that are indicated for the treatment of insomnia  including our product doral 
we are currently evaluating the information requested in the letter and will take actions appropriate to comply with the fda request 
drugs in development products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act  and if applicable by foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous pre clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us and current or potential development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
product liability insurance the clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims  against which we maintain liability insurance 
see item a risk factors risks relating to our business if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products for a discussion of certain risks related to product liability claims that may be made against us 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have a patent on acthar or doral 
however  we do have us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing 
table of contents technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see item a risk factors risks relating to our business if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues for a discussion of additional risks related to intellectual property rights 
employees we have full time employees as compared to full time employees at december  
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
we have employees engaged directly in the marketing and selling of our products 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

financial information please refer to item  selected consolidated financial data  for a review of our financial results and financial position for the five years ended december   and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue and net income loss for the three years ended december  item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a history of operating losses and may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we have a history of recurring operating losses  and our accumulated deficit through december  was million 
we recognized net income applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  of million  however  this included a one time gain of million on the divestment of our non core product lines 
our net loss applicable to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  and million for year ended december  for the three years ended december   our revenues have been generated from sales of acthar  doral  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil and vsl 
in october  we sold the nascobal  ethamolin and glofil product lines  and accordingly we are no longer selling such products 
our agreement to promote vsl expired in january  and we are no longer selling vsl our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations will be dependent in large part upon our ability to develop  finance and implement effective promotional strategies for our commercial products  continue to receive finished product and api from our sole source contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at acceptable costs  ensure customers compliance with our sales and product return policies  finance and acquire additional commercial products  finance and develop additional commercial products  continue to control our operating expenses  and finance operations until consistent positive cash flows are achieved 

table of contents if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from sales of our existing commercial products  or if we are unable to contain costs and expenses  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if our revenues from sales of acthar decline or fail to grow  we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
for the year ended december   sales of acthar represented of our total net sales 
we expect to continue to rely on this product for the majority of our product sales for the foreseeable future 
although our goal is to actively promote acthar  and  as of the date of this report  we have no reason to believe that our promotion of acthar will not be successful  we cannot predict whether the demand for acthar will continue in the future or that we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar 
we may choose  in the future  to reallocate our sales and promotion efforts for acthar which may result in a decrease in revenues from this product 
if the demand for acthar declines  or if we are forced to reduce the price  or if returns of expired products are higher than anticipated  or if we are forced to re negotiate contracts or terms  or if our customers do not comply with our existing policies  our revenues from the sale of acthar would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  and we are unable to raise the price correspondingly  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our revenues from the sale of acthar decline or fail to grow  our total revenues  gross margins and operating results would be harmed and we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
we have little or no control over our wholesalers buying patterns  which may impact future revenues and returns and may result in excess inventory 
we sell our products primarily through major drug wholesalers located in the united states 
consistent with the pharmaceutical industry  most of our revenues are derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
these wholesalers represented approximately of our gross product sales for the year ended december  while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at the three largest wholesalers using inventory data obtained from them  historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
we rely solely upon the wholesalers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
there can be no assurance that these wholesalers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid outages or inventory build ups 
on occasion we note that the wholesalers buy quantities of product in excess of the quantities being sold by them  resulting in increasing inventories 
we will generally accept for credit pharmaceutical products returned within the six month period following the expiration date 
we establish reserves for these credit memoranda at the time of sale 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately forecast the reserve requirements needed to provide for credit memoranda issued in the future 
although our estimates are reviewed quarterly for reasonableness  our product return activity could differ significantly from our estimates because our analyses of product shipments  prescription trends and the amount of product in the distribution channel may not be accurate 
judgment is required in estimating these reserves 
actual amounts could be significantly different from the estimates and such differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
we do not control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of the drug wholesalers who purchase our products 
these wholesalers are sophisticated companies that purchase our products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and perceived business interests 
our sales are subject to the purchase requirements of the major wholesalers  which  presumably  are based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any customer  during any period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of our products during the same period  resulting in increases or decreases in product inventory existing in the distribution channel 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or otherwise impaired inventory 
reserves for excess finished goods and work in process inventories are based on an analysis of our expected future sales to our wholesaler customers that will occur before the inventory on hand expires 
reserves for raw material inventories are based on viability and projected future use 
judgment is required in estimating reserves for excess or impaired inventories 
actual amounts of required reserves could be different from the estimates and such differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 

table of contents if we are unable to contract with third party contract manufacturers  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our existing products  and will likely do the same for other products that we may develop  commercialize or acquire in the future 
contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our required products and services on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if the required approvals by the fda and other regulatory authorities do not occur on a timely basis  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose fda approval of our products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
if our third party distributors are unable to distribute our products or the costs to distribute our products increase substantially  we will lose potential revenues and profits 
we transferred certain product distribution functions  including warehousing  shipping and quality control studies  to third party distributors 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may experience difficulties at the third party contractor level that could reduce  delay or stop shipments of our products 
if we encounter such distribution problems  our product could become unavailable and we could lose revenues  or the costs to distribute our product could become higher than we anticipated 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross product sales were derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
two of these three wholesalers mandate a distribution fee for handling our products 
if other wholesalers institute similar fees  or if such fees increase in magnitude in the future  our costs to distribute our products will increase  and our gross profit margins will decline 
the loss of our key management personnel could have an adverse impact on future operations 
we are highly dependent on the services of mr 
james l 
fares  our president and chief executive officer  as well as other principal members of our management team 
we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  financial operations  business development  clinical development  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which may include extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes 
table of contents in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that we develop  impose significant additional costs on us  diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and decrease our ability to generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
during the year ended december   we announced the initiation of a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  our first announced clinical development program since we adopted our cns focused strategy in additionally  the fda accepted for review our supplemental new drug application seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to develop qsc or obtain approval of acthar for infantile spasm will be successful or will not be delayed due to regulatory or other factors 
in addition  no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements for our currently marketed products or any new product once clearance or approval has been obtained 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling and postmarketing reporting  including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns 
the facilities and procedures of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation  including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
we must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 
possible regulatory actions could include warning letters  fines  damages  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  seizures of our products and criminal prosecution 
these actions could result in  among other things  substantial modifications to our business practices and operations  refunds  recalls or a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our suppliers facilities while our suppliers remedy the alleged violation  the inability to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market 
any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
products that we may acquire or develop may not be accepted by the market  which may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
any products that we successfully acquire or develop in the future  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully developed  may compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize the products that we may develop or that our corporate partners may develop 
the degree of market acceptance of our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  
table of contents their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance for any products that we successfully acquire or develop in the future  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if competitors develop and market products that are more effective than ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of ours  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  and to develop  acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection  or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for clinical development  manufacturing  and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions will compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
if our competitors succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we develop or acquire  our technology and future drugs may be rendered obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the fda or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we will 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market specific products 
we do not know if drugs resulting from the joint efforts of our existing or future collaborative partners will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development or whether we will obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere 
if we fail to maintain or enter into new contracts related to collaborations and in licensed or acquired technology and products  our product development and commercialization could be delayed 
our business model has been dependent on our ability to enter into licensing and acquisition arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology for commercialization or marketed products 
if we are 
table of contents unable to enter into any new agreements in the future  our development and commercialization efforts will be delayed 
disputes may arise regarding the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license and acquisition agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  current license and acquisition agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
if collaborators do not commit sufficient development resources  technology  regulatory expertise  manufacturing  marketing and other resources towards developing  promoting and commercializing products incorporating our discoveries  the progress of our licensed products development will be stalled 
further  competitive conflicts may arise among these third parties that could prevent them from working cooperatively with us 
the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities by the parties could depend on the achievement of milestones by us and otherwise generally may be controlled by other parties 
in addition  we expect that our agreements with future collaborators will likely permit the collaborators to terminate their agreements upon written notice to us 
this type of termination would substantially reduce the likelihood that the applicable research program or any lead candidate or candidates would be developed into a drug candidate  would obtain regulatory approvals and would be manufactured and successfully commercialized 
if none of our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products  or if we do not receive milestone payments or generate revenues from royalties sufficient to offset our significant investment in product development and other costs  then our business could be harmed 
disagreements with our collaborators could lead to delays or interruptions in  or termination of  development and commercialization of certain potential products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which could be time consuming and expensive and may result in lost revenues and substantial legal costs which could negatively impact our results from operations 
in addition  if we are unable to acquire new marketed products on a timely basis at an appropriate purchase price and terms  we may not reach profitability and may not generate sufficient cash to fund operations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
we do not have patents on our existing commercial products 
however  our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

table of contents in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to generate revenues is affected by the availability of reimbursement on our products  and our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from third party payors 
in both domestic and foreign markets  the sale of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and private insurance plans 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally is subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may also impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic is approved  the reimbursement status and rate of such a product is uncertain 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for our existing products may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for our products may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our product  which could result in lower product sales or revenues  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
in the united states  proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such changes enacted may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
the medicare prescription drug improvement  and modernization act  enacted in december  provides for  among other things  an immediate reduction in the medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs administered in a physician s office 
the medicare act  as well as other changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for our products  may reduce or eliminate reimbursement of our products costs 
in addition  if the medicare act were amended  or other regulations were adopted  to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions  it would have a significant adverse impact on our business 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in several states and local metropolitan areas 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to innovative medicines  the market acceptance of these products may be reduced 
we are unable to predict what impact the medicare act or other future legislation  if any  relating to third party reimbursement  will have on our product sales 
to facilitate the availability of our products for medicaid patients  we have contracted with the center for medicare and medicaid services 
as a result  we pay quarterly rebates consistent with the utilization of our products by individual states 
we also give discounts under contract on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
if these discounts and rebates become burdensome to us and we are not able to sell our products through these channels  our net sales could decline 

table of contents our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the american stock exchange  have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to prepare to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations for fiscal years ending on or after july  regarding our management s required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation of that assessment will require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
although management believes that ongoing efforts to assess our internal control over financial reporting will enable management to provide the required report  and our independent auditors to provide the required attestation  under section  we can give no assurance that such efforts will be completed on a timely and successful basis to enable our management and independent auditors to provide the required report and attestation in order to comply with sec rules effective for us 
moreover  because the new and changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business will expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and for those products we currently market 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to million 
however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted 
risks related to our common stock we may seek additional funding which would dilute your investment 
we may seek to raise capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
if revenues from product sales are less than we expect or if further capital resources are not available  or if such resources cannot be obtained on attractive terms to us  this may further limit our ability to fund operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  successfully implementing our growth strategy  achieving better operating efficiencies  
table of contents successfully subleasing our vacant facility in hayward  california  maintaining customer compliance with our policies  and obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers 
we may obtain additional financing through public or private debt or equity financings 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our shareholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to reduce our operations or to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our products or development programs 
if our officers  directors and largest shareholders choose to act together  they could exert significant influence over the outcome of a shareholder vote 
our officers  directors and holders of or more of our outstanding common stock may be deemed to beneficially own approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock as of december  as a result  these shareholders  acting together  would be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
the interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders  and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders 
the voting power of these shareholders includes the shares held by our largest shareholder  sigma tau finanziaria spa  which beneficially owns approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock 
our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our common stock  like that of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
the closing price per share of our common stock ranged in value from to during the two year period ended december  any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
for example  our quarterly revenues or earnings or losses can fluctuate based on the buying patterns of our major wholesaler customers 
in the event that prescription demand for acthar is less than our sales to our wholesaler customers  excess inventory may result at the wholesaler level  which may impact future product sales 
other potential events that could affect our stock price include  without limitation  our quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings or losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  our ability to obtain product from our contract manufacturers  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us

factors that could affect our future operating results and cause them to differ  possibly significantly  from those currently anticipated are described in i item a  entitled risk factors  in part i of this annual report  and ii the subsection entitled critical accounting policies and use of estimates in item below and  accordingly  the 
table of contents descriptions of the risk factors and the critical accounting policies and use of estimates in this annual report should be read in their entirety 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases and disorders of the central nervous system cns 
we currently own and market two commercial cns products  hp acthar gel acthar and doral 
we acquired the rights to doral quazepam in may acthar repository corticotropin injection is an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of a wide range of conditions with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also used in treating patients with infantile spasm  an epileptic syndrome 
doral is indicated for the treatment of insomnia  characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings  which occurs frequently in patients with cns diseases and disorders 
we announced our cns strategy in april as part of this strategy  we are pursuing the development of new products that have the potential to address unmet medical needs in the cns field as well as the licensing and acquisition of additional cns commercial products and product candidates 
in connection with our cns focused strategy  in october we sold our non cns pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  a prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and  glofil  an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function  to qol medical llc qol 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million 
our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  included the net product sales and direct operating costs and expenses of the divested product lines through the divestment date of october  because the divested product lines were part of a larger cash flow generating group and did not represent a separate operation  the divested product lines were not reported as discontinued operations 
this transaction provided us with capital to retire our remaining outstanding debt of million in october  redeem our outstanding series b preferred stock for million in january  expand our sales organization  fund our on going operations  and help expand our cns product portfolio 
as previously mentioned above  in may we completed the acquisition of doral from medpointe healthcare inc medpointe 
as consideration for the rights to doral in the united states  we paid medpointe million in cash upon the closing of the transaction and million in december after the approval of an alternative source to manufacture and supply the active ingredient for doral 
in august  the us food and drug administration fda accepted for review our supplemental new drug application snda seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms 
we anticipate that the fda will take action on the snda during the second quarter of no drug is currently approved in the united states for the treatment of infantile spasms 
in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock to unaffiliated institutional investors at a purchase price of per share and  shares of our common stock to certain insiders at a purchase price of per share 
the net offering proceeds were approximately million after deducting placement agency fees and offering expenses 
all of the shares were offered under an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and working capital of million 
we believe that our cash resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least december  if our existing cash resources are not sufficient to meet our obligations  we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
such financing may not be available under acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  the results of our sales efforts  demand for our products by patients and consumers  inventory levels of our products at wholesalers  timing of expiration of our products  future credit memoranda to be issued under our credit memoranda return policy  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the timing of certain expenses  the acquisition of marketed products  the establishment of strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements and the receipt of milestone payments 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales reserves  product returns  bad debts  inventories  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales reserves we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies  government chargebacks for goods purchased by certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  medicaid rebates to all states for products purchased by patients covered by medicaid  and  cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for existing products and data obtained from external sources 
significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these sales reserves are the most reasonably likely assumptions considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our product return activity  government chargebacks received  and medicaid rebates paid could differ significantly from our estimates because our analysis of product shipments  prescription trends and the amount of product in the distribution channel may not be accurate 
if actual product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates are significantly different from our estimates  or if the wholesalers fail to adhere to our expired product returns policy  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
to date  actual amounts have been consistent with our estimates 
during the second quarter of we implemented a transition plan for expired product returns from a product exchange policy to a credit memoranda policy for the return of expired product within six months after the expiration date 
expired product returned from lots released after may  is subject to a credit memoranda policy in which a credit memoranda will be issued for the original purchase price of the returned product 
a reserve for the sales value of estimated returns on shipments of product lots released and shipped after may  is recorded as a liability as shipments occur with a corresponding reduction in gross product sales 
this reserve reflects an estimate of future credit memoranda to be issued  applied to the quantity of product shipped from lots subject to the credit memoranda policy 
the reserve will be reduced as future credit memoranda are issued  with an offset to accounts receivable 
under our product exchange policy  we shipped replacement product for expired product returned to us within six months after expiration 
the estimated costs for such potential exchanges  which included actual product costs and related shipping charges  were included in cost of product sales 
a reserve for estimated returns on shipments of acthar product lots released and shipped prior to june  was recorded as a liability in the amount of  as of december  this reserve reflected an estimate of future acthar replacements  applied to the quantity 
table of contents of product shipped from lots subject to the product exchange policy 
the reserve was reduced as future product replacements occurred  with an offset to product inventories 
no liability for product exchanges was required as of december  the return rate for expired product is based primarily on historical return rates by product and analysis of return merchandise authorizations 
we also consider current inventory on hand at wholesalers  the remaining shelf life of that inventory  and changes in demand measured by prescriptions or other data as provided by an independent third party source 
we believe that the information obtained from wholesalers regarding inventory levels and from independent third parties regarding prescription demand is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
we routinely assess our historical experience including customers compliance with our product return policy  and we adjust our reserves as appropriate 
a transition period extended through between the product exchange policy  applicable to product lots released prior to june   and the credit memoranda return policy  applicable to product lots released after may  during the transition from our product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy for expired product in  both the product exchange policy and the credit memoranda return policy were in effect at the same time  which resulted in lower revenues than historically experienced due to the additional impact of the displacement of future sales from the product exchange policy and the reduction of gross product sales for the reserves under the credit memoranda return policy 
at december  and  sales related reserves for product returns were as follows december  in s balance  beginning of year actual returns in current year related to sales from prior years actual returns in current year related to sales from current year current provision related to sales made in prior years current provision related to sales made in current year transfer of divested product line accruals balance  end of year the increase in the provision as of december  relates to the increase in our gross sales of acthar and an increase in the number of acthar lots subject to the credit memoranda policy 
the provision related to sales made in prior years primarily reflects adjustments to the estimated rate of product returns 
activity for nascobal and ethamolin is included in the table above through october   which is the date we sold these product lines 
in connection with the sale of the nascobal  ethamolin and glofil product lines  we were responsible for all medicaid rebates and government chargebacks on our sales of these product lines through october  we were responsible for product returns on our sales of nascobal and ethamolin through october   but only to the extent the returns were authorized by january  subsequent to october   we no longer had access to nascobal and ethamolin product inventories to facilitate product replacements under our product replacement policy 
as a result  credit was provided on all returns of these products after october  the difference between the amount of credit expected to be issued on the divested products and the  accrued in our product replacement and credit memorandum reserves as of october  was considered in the determination of the computed gain on the sale of the divested products 
as of december   we had credit memorandum return reserves related to the divested product lines of  that were excluded from the balance as of december  and the balance as of january  in the table above 
in estimating medicaid rebates  we match the actual rebates to the quantity of product sold by pharmacies on a product by product basis to arrive at an actual rebate percentage 
this historical percentage is used to estimate a rebate percentage that is applied to the sales to which the rebates apply to arrive at the estimated rebate reserve for the period 
we also consider allowable prices by medicaid 
in estimating government chargeback reserves  we analyze actual chargeback amounts by product and apply historical chargeback rates to sales to which chargebacks apply 
we routinely assess our experience with medicaid rebates and government chargebacks and adjust the 
table of contents reserves accordingly 
for qualified customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
allowances for cash discounts are estimated based upon the amount of trade accounts receivable subject to the cash discounts 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for excess and obsolete inventory due to the expiration of shelf life of a product 
in estimating inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  we analyze i the expiration date  ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual future usage and demand for our products is less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write offs may be required in the future 
we intend to control inventory levels of our products purchased by our customers 
customer inventories may be compared to both internal and external databases to determine adequate inventory levels 
we may monitor our product shipments to customers and compare these shipments against prescription demand for our individual products 
intangible and long lived assets as of december  our intangible and long lived assets included goodwill generated from a merger in and purchased technology related to our acquisition of doral in may in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
our fair value is compared to the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount  then no impairment is indicated 
as of december  and  we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the costs related to our acquisition of doral are being amortized over an estimated life of years 
long lived assets  consisting of property and equipment and purchased technology  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use or disposition of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets carrying value is adjusted to fair value 
as of december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our rewards 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and pre vesting forfeitures 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in the current period 
prior to january   we accounted for share based payments to our employees and non employee members of our board of directors under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related guidance  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and amended by sfas no

measuring and assigning of compensation cost for share based grants made prior to  but not vested as of  the date of adopting sfas no 
r have been based upon the same estimate of grant date fair value previously disclosed under 
table of contents sfas no 
in a pro forma manner 
we did not recognize any significant share based employee compensation costs in our statements of operations prior to january   as options granted to employees and non employee members of our board of directors generally had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as required by sfas no 
 prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we provided pro forma disclosure of net income loss applicable to common shareholders as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
in the pro forma information for periods prior to  we accounted for pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred 
our operating results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  our net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  includes million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our employee stock purchase plan is expected to be recognized through november   which represents the end of the current offering period 
lease termination liability we entered into an agreement to sublease laboratory and office space  including laboratory equipment  at our hayward  california facility in july  due to the termination of our then existing drug discovery programs 
the sublease on our hayward facility expired in july our obligations under the hayward master lease extend through november during the fourth quarter of  the sublessee notified us that they did not intend to extend the sublease beyond the end of july we determined that there was no loss associated with the hayward facility when we initially subleased the space as we expected cash inflows from the sublease to exceed our rent cost over the term of the master lease 
however  we reevaluated this in when the sublessee notified us that it would not be renewing the sublease beyond july as a result  we computed a loss on the sublease in the fourth quarter of in accordance with fin accounting for a loss on a sublease  an interpretation of fasb and apb opinion no 
and ftb  accounting for the loss on a sublease not involving the disposal of a segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a loss of  on the master lease and a liability of million as of december  related to future lease obligations as we determined that we may not be able to fully recover our lease cost through the expiration of the master lease 
the fair value of the liability was determined using a credit adjusted risk free rate to discount the estimated future net cash flows  consisting of the minimum lease payments under the master lease  net of estimated sublease rental income that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
the most significant assumption in estimating the lease termination liability relates to our estimate of future sublease income 
we base our estimate of sublease income  in part  on the opinion of independent real estate experts  current market conditions  and rental rates  among other factors 
adjustments to the lease termination liability will be required if actual sublease income differs from amounts currently expected 
we are also required to recognize an on going accretion expense representing the difference between the undiscounted net cash flows and the discounted net cash flows over the remaining term of the hayward master lease using the interest method 
the accretion amount represents an on going adjustment to the estimated liability 
we review the assumptions used in determining the estimated liability quarterly and revise our estimate of the liability to reflect changes in circumstances 
the on going accretion expense and any revisions to the liability are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we revised our estimate of the liability and recorded an additional loss of  as of december  and  the estimated liability related to the hayward facility totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in lease termination and deferred rent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

the increase in neurology net product sales was due primarily to a increase in acthar net product sales as compared to the year ended december  the increase in acthar net product sales was due primarily to a increase in unit sales and an approximate increase in the average acthar selling price as compared to net product sales of doral of  represented of the increase in neurology net product sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in may  we purchased the rights in the us to doral from medpointe 
doral is a commercial product indicated for the treatment of insomnia  which occurs frequently in patients with cns diseases and disorders 
medpointe is obligated for all product returns  medicaid rebates  and chargebacks on sales of doral prior to the closing date 
we commenced shipments of doral in may and our sales force began actively promoting doral to neurologists in july we review the amount of inventory of our products at the wholesale level in order to help assess the demand for our products 
we may choose to defer sales in situations where we believe inventory levels are already adequate

selling  general and administrative years ended december  increase change in s selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million from the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the expansion of our sales organization  increased promotion of acthar and doral  our adoption of sfas no

table of contents cost of product sales years ended december  decrease change cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of product sales is primarily due to a decrease in material costs of approximately  and other indirect costs as a result of the sale of our non core product lines in october and the inclusion of vsl direct costs in this decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately  in routine acthar stability testing costs and an increase of  in inventory obsolescence expense in as compared to stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred 
cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to lower net sales in  resulting from higher reserves recorded as a reduction to gross sales for returns under our credit memoranda return policy and for medicaid rebates 
selling  general and administrative years ended december  decrease change in s selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from the year ended december  the decrease was due in part to the inclusion in of approximately  in severance and related expenses associated with the departure of our former ceo in the third quarter of and the write off of  in goodwill related to the impairment of the assembled workforce component of the goodwill in the fourth quarter of a decrease in access fees to sigma tau pharmaceuticals of  due to the expiration of our vsl co promotion agreement in january and a decrease of  in marketing expenses also contributed to the lower selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by expenses of  associated with our hayward sublease  and increases in legal and consulting expenses of approximately  and bad debt expense of  as compared to the year ended december  the sublease on our hayward facility terminated on july  our obligations under the hayward master lease extend through november during the fourth quarter of  the sublessee notified us that they did not intend to extend the sublease beyond the end of july the market for office and laboratory space in the area has softened significantly since we initially subleased the facility 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of we recognized a loss of  on the hayward master lease as we determined that we may not be able to fully recover our lease cost over the remaining term of the master lease 
the loss represented a liability of million as of december  related to our future lease obligation  offset by the reversal of a  related net deferred rent liability 
the fair value of the liability was determined using a credit adjusted risk free rate to discount the estimated future cash flows  consisting of the minimum lease payments under the master lease  net of estimated sublease rental income that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
we review our assumptions and estimates quarterly and revise our estimates of this liability to reflect changes in circumstances

for the year ended december   an increase in consulting fees of approximately  and an increase in patent related legal expenses of approximately  offset a decrease of approximately  of acthar site transfer costs  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our acthar site transfer costs were minimal as compared to approximately  of acthar site transfer costs incurred in in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
this transfer was approved by the fda in january in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have selected a contract laboratory to perform two bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
these bioassays have been successfully transferred from aventis now zlb behring to the contract laboratory  and were approved by the fda in june we experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of a third assay  potency 
zlb behring agreed to perform any potency assays we required through in february  we extended our agreement with zlb behring through and terminated the potency assay transfer project 
the transfer of manufacturing from aventis to our new contract manufacturers is resulting in higher unit costs than the fixed price manufacturing agreement with aventis 
depreciation and amortization years ended december  decrease change in s depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower amortization expense related to the nascobal purchased technology

if our cash resources at december  are not sufficient to meet our obligations  or if we have insufficient funds to acquire additional products or expand our operations  we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
however  traditional asset based debt financing has not been available on acceptable terms
