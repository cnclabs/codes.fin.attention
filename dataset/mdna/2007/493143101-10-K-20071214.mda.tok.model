overview sales for the year ended september  were million compared with million for fiscal the company reported net earnings for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share  for fiscal the principal reasons for the increase in net earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal were the increase in sales volume  reflecting the increase in orders for fiscal  and the improvement of gross margins to in fiscal from in fiscal automated inspection systems sales were up  process systems sales were up  and parts and service sales remained on par with the prior fiscal year 
the primary market forces driving demand for our products are the increased concerns about food safety and security  the inability of food and pharmaceutical processors to obtain cost effective labor  and the company s expansion into international markets 
export and international sales for the fiscal years ended september   and accounted for  and of net sales in each year  respectively 
in  the company again focused efforts on three major initiatives to achieve its long term revenue growth plan expand and grow its participation in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical market  strengthen and grow the level of business in china  and continue to grow the company s aftermarket product lines 
although the results from reflected some revenue progress from these initiatives  sales in our core businesses including upgrades accounted for the majority of the increased revenues 
the pharmaceutical initiative began in the fourth quarter of with the formation of the symetix business unit 
this business unit was formed to dedicate a team of employees to develop and grow key s business in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical market 
anticipated penetration into this market will extend and advance the company s existing patented  high resolution inspection technology and material handling platforms 
revenue increased million in fiscal to million as efforts on the pharmaceutical initiative began to make progress 
the company has historically been successful in selling tobacco sorters in china 
larger opportunities exist there in the food processing business as well  and the company invested in china during fiscal to enhance sales  service and applications support to build upon its established base 
in  the company opened offices and located personnel in country 
in  the company experienced similar sales volumes into the chinese market as in  but with new traction in the food processing equipment market which was offset by lower fiscal tobacco volume 
increased order volume in the last two quarters of fiscal indicates that the company s expansion efforts into the chinese food processing market is gaining traction 
the company also focused on its aftermarket product lines which include parts service and upgrades during with the introduction of the g family of products in  this enhanced vision engine technology provided additional product upgrade opportunities 
upgrades are an important aspect of the aftermarket product lines  and the 
table of contents new modular g product family  which provides advanced image processing capability  has been well received by the company s current customers 
aftermarket sales including upgrades which are classified in automated inspection systems increased in fiscal from fiscal by to million 
the company believes a increase in upgrade orders in fiscal over fiscal and the strong backlog at the end of fiscal bode well for the fiscal performance of the aftermarket business 
other accomplishments during fiscal included completing the initial audit of the company s internal controls pursuant to sarbanes oxley section  completing the closure of the company s manufacturing facilities in australia  reducing staff in the medford  oregon sales and engineering office  and selling the company s interest in the inspx joint venture 
the company s strategic initiatives for are to continue to build upon the direction and solid revenue base the company developed during the focus for the coming year is to continue to grow sales in the company s core markets and invest in a market driven technology road map that provides the new products required by our customers 
in addition  the company will focus on four primary industries potatoes  fresh cut produce  processed fruit and vegetables  and pharmaceutical nutraceutical  and focus on four developing regions china  latin america  eastern europe and the middle east 
the company also plans to increase research and development expenditures and develop a global enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
efforts in research and development will continue to focus on customer solutions  providing new products that meet current needs as well as anticipated future functionality requirements 
the company began preliminary work on developing a global erp system in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company has selected an erp system and a business partner 
implementation will be spread over a three year period  with total costs of million expected over the period 
a significant portion of these erp implementation costs will be capitalized 
application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all criteria are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
revenue earned from services maintenance  installation support  and repairs is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if any contract provides for both equipment and services multiple deliverables  the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described 
table of contents criteria 
the company s sales arrangements provide for no other significant post shipment obligations 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  the company has experienced few sales returns 
if the company believes there are potential sales returns  the company will provide any necessary provision against sales 
in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  the company accounts for cash consideration such as sales incentives that are given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless an identified benefit is received for which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to recognize or defer revenue based on those terms 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at september   the company had invoiced million compared to million at september  for which the company has not recognized revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectibility of receivables include general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payments  and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september   the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  amounts charged to bad debt expense for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net earnings 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
write downs for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million as of september  amounts charged to expense to record inventory at lower of cost or market for fiscal and were  and million  respectively 
actual charges to the cumulative inventory adjustments upon disposition or sale of inventory were  and million for fiscal and  respectively 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  
table of contents inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  and a decrease to gross margins 
long lived assets 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets is recorded 
in addition  goodwill is reviewed based on its fair value at least annually 
as of september   the company held million of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
there were no changes in the company s long lived assets that would result in an adjustment of the carrying value for these assets 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period 
allowances for warranties 
the company s products are covered by standard warranty plans included in the price of the products ranging from days to five years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the majority of product warranties are for periods between one and two years 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components and  therefore  warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of its products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  a quality training curriculum for every employee and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of million  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of million as of september  and warranty charges of million for the fiscal year then ended 
if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  future warranty plan coverages are different  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty expense would need to increase  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
at september   the company had valuation reserves of approximately  consisting of  for deferred tax assets related to the sale of the investment in the inspx joint venture and the valuation reserve for notes receivable and contingent payments  and a net  for combined us  australian and chinese deferred tax assets and liabilities  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in those foreign jurisdictions 
there were no other valuation allowances at september  due to anticipated utilization of all the deferred tax assets as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income to utilize these 
table of contents assets 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
potential income tax exposures include potential challenges of various tax credits  export related tax benefits  and issues specific to state and local tax jurisdictions 
exposures are typically settled primarily through audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
during fiscal and  there have been no significant changes in these estimates 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
this legislation phases out the extra territorial income exclusion eti beginning january  through december  the eti exclusion reduced the company s effective tax rate by  and in  and  respectively 
the legislation also provides for a new deduction for manufacturing income  which phases in beginning in the company s fiscal year through the company anticipates that this deduction will largely  if not completely  offset the loss of the eti exclusion 
however  the effects in individual fiscal years during the phase in periods may vary and increase the company s effective tax rate during these periods 
for fiscal and  the deduction for manufacturing income reduced the company s effective tax rate by and  respectively
