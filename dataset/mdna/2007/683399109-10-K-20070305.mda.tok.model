item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer 
with our collaborators  we are developing small molecule drugs with the goal of changing the way cancer is treated tm 
a common feature of cancer cells is the excessive activation of signaling pathways that cause abnormal cell proliferation 
in addition  tumors require oxygen and nutrients from newly formed blood vessels to support their growth 
the formation of these new blood vessels is a process called angiogenesis 
we are applying our expertise to develop oral anticancer therapies designed to prevent cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis by inhibiting proteins that signal or support tumor growth 
by exploiting the genetic differences between cancer cells and normal cells  we aim to create novel anticancer agents that minimize damage to healthy tissue 
our product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  developed with our collaborator  bayer pharmaceuticals corporation  or bayer  was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in december for the treatment of individuals with advanced kidney cancer 
this approval marked the first newly approved drug for patients with this disease in over a decade 
in july  nexavar received approval to treat patients in the european union with advanced kidney cancer who have failed prior interferon alpha or interleukin based therapy or are considered unsuitable for such therapy 
nexavar has received approvals in other territories worldwide 
nexavar is a novel  orally available multi kinase inhibitor and is one of a new class of anticancer treatments that target growth signaling 
on march   we and bayer entered into a co promotion agreement to co promote nexavar in the united states 
this agreement amends the original collaboration agreement and supersedes the provisions of that agreement that relate to the co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
outside of the united states  the terms of the collaboration agreement continue to govern 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement and consistent with the collaboration agreement  we will share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar worldwide  excluding japan 
please refer to note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and potentially increasing losses for the foreseeable future  due to expenses associated with the continuing development and commercialization of nexavar 
since inception  we have relied on public and private financings  combined with milestone payments from our collaborators to fund our operations 
in january  we received the fourth and final million milestone advance from bayer as a result of the fda approval of nexavar 
however  we expect that our losses will continue and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we consider certain accounting policies related to net expense from unconsolidated joint business  stock based compensation and research and development to be critical policies 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in included assumptions used in the determination of stock based compensation related to stock options granted 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
net expense from unconsolidated joint business net expense from unconsolidated joint business relates to our collaboration with bayer for the development and marketing of nexavar 
it consists of our share of the net collaboration loss generated from our collaboration agreement with bayer net of the reimbursement of our development and marketing expenses related to nexavar 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
the net expense from the unconsolidated joint business is  in effect  the net amount due to bayer to balance the companies economics under the nexavar collaboration 
under the terms of the collaboration  the companies share all research and development  marketing  and non us sales expenses  excluding japan 
some of the revenue and expenses recorded to derive the net expense from unconsolidated joint business during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ materially from these estimates 
if the company underestimates activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  the company could record significant additional expenses in future periods 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
r  share based payment  fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payments made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards and employee stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  based on estimated fair value 
we previously applied the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under fas  accounting for stock based compensation  or fas we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method beginning january  accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under fas were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for these awards  the company has continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
for stock based awards granted after january   we recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under fas r 
the compensation expense for these awards was recognized using a straight line amortization method 
the net loss for the year ended december  includes stock based compensation expense of million  or per share for the adoption of fas r 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation balance for unvested shares  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of months 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects if any of stock based compensation expense pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool 
table of contents related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact to the apic pool and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility and stock option exercise behavior 
we expect to continue to use the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation expense 
however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price  expected life and stock option exercise behaviors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
research and development expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials  and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately percent in and percent in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and other information we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
in addition  research and development costs incurred by us and reimbursed by bayer are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
in  consistent with the terms of our collaboration agreement  our share of bayer s nexavar product development expenses are included in net expense from unconsolidated joint business 
thus  in  only our direct research and development expenses are included in the research and development line item 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
nexavar  our only marketed product  was approved in the us in december in accordance with our collaboration agreement with bayer  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
as such  for the year ended december   we reported no revenue related to nexavar 
for the year ended december  
table of contents  nexavar net sales recorded by bayer were million  primarily in the united states and the european union 
total revenue was  in  million in and  in total revenue in represents  recognized for selling the rights to certain viruses from our now discontinued therapeutic virus program to shanghai sunway biotech co 
ltd and  recognized for licensing rights to certain cytopathic viruses for therapy and prophylaxis of neoplasia to dnatrix 
total revenue in represented a payment from shanghai sunway biotech co 
ltd 
in exchange for the transfer to shanghai sunway of the intellectual property and know how related to onyx we have no ongoing performance obligations under any of these agreements 
total revenue in of  represented a milestone payment from warner lambert  now a subsidiary of pfizer inc  when they initiated phase clinical testing advancing a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
net expense from unconsolidated joint business 
nexavar is currently marketed and sold in the united states  several countries in the european union and other countries worldwide for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer 
we co promote nexavar in the united states with bayer under a collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar outside of japan and its continued promotion of nexavar in the united states 
the collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
bayer provides all product distribution and all marketing support services for nexavar in the united states  including managed care  customer service  order entry and billing 
bayer is compensated for distribution expenses based on a fixed percent of gross sales of nexavar in the united states 
bayer is reimbursed for half of its expenses for marketing services provided by bayer for the sale of nexavar in the united states 
we and bayer share equally in any other out of pocket marketing expenses other than expenses for sales force and medical science liaisons that we and bayer incur in connection with the marketing and promotion of nexavar in the united states 
bayer manufactures all nexavar sold in the united states and is reimbursed at an agreed transfer price per unit for the cost of goods sold 
in the united states  we contribute half of the overall number of sales force personnel required to market and promote nexavar and half of the medical science liaisons to support nexavar 
onyx and bayer each bears its own sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these expenses are not included in the calculation of the profits or losses of the collaboration 
outside of the united states  except in japan  bayer incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures  and we share equally in those expenditures 
in addition  upon approval of nexavar in countries outside the united states  except japan  we will reimburse bayer a fixed percentage of sales to reimburse them for their marketing infrastructure 
research and development expenditures on a worldwide basis  except in japan  are equally shared by both companies regardless of whether we or bayer incurs the expense 
in japan  bayer is responsible for all development and marketing costs and we will receive a royalty on net sales of nexavar 
net expense from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of the pretax collaboration loss generated from our collaboration with bayer net of the reimbursement of our marketing and research and development costs related to nexavar 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all sales of nexavar worldwide 
we record our share of the collaboration pre tax loss on a quarterly basis 
collaboration loss is derived by calculating net sales of nexavar to third party customers and deducting the cost of goods sold  distribution costs  marketing costs including without limitation  advertising and education expenses  selling and promotion expenses  marketing personnel expenses  and bayer marketing services expenses  phase clinical trial costs  allocable overhead costs and research and development costs 
the net expense from the unconsolidated joint business is  in effect  the net amount due to bayer to balance the companies economics under the nexavar collaboration 
as noted above  united states sales force and medical science liaison expenditures incurred by both companies are borne by each company separately and are not included in the calculation 
some of the revenue and expenses recorded to derive the net expense from unconsolidated joint business during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ from these estimates 
if 
table of contents we underestimate activity levels associated with the co promotion and collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could record significant additional expense in future periods 
net expense from unconsolidated joint business decreases with increased nexavar net revenue and as the differential between bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses declines 
if nexavar net revenue is greater than the differential between bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses  we will report a net profit from unconsolidated joint business 
conversely  if nexavar net revenue declines or if the differential between bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses increases  net expense from unconsolidated joint business will increase 
due to the uncertainty in bayer s revenue from the sale of nexavar and the relative expenses of bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses  it is not possible to predict our net expense from unconsolidated joint business for future periods 
we expect bayer s and our shared nexavar research and development expenses to increase in future periods as the companies develop nexavar for indications beyond advanced kidney cancer 
we also expect bayer s and our shared cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expense to increase as bayer continues to expand nexavar marketing and sales activities outside of the united states 
for the year ended december   net expense from unconsolidated joint business was million calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands product revenue  net combined cost of goods sold  distribution  selling  general and administrative combined research and development combined collaboration loss onyx s share of collaboration loss reimbursement of onyx s direct development and marketing expenses onyx s net expense from unconsolidated joint business research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  including stock based compensation expense of million in  a net decrease of million  or percent  from million in we did not expense employee stock based compensation prior to our adoption of fas r on january  the decrease was primarily due to the change in presentation of our statement of operations to reflect the co promotion agreement by including the net expense from unconsolidated joint business line item 
our share of bayer s nexavar product development expenses is included in net expense from unconsolidated joint business for the year ended december  in years prior to  bayer s nexavar product development expense was included in research and development expense 
in the new presentation beginning in  only our direct research and development expenses are included in the research and development line item 
onyx and bayer are continuing to expand their investment in the development of nexavar for additional indications including phase trials for nexavar in melanoma  liver cancer and lung cancer 
research and development expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or percent  from in  the increase in research and development expenses were primarily driven by a million increase in onyx s share of co development costs for the nexavar program  principally for the clinical trial program which included the expanded access program in the phase kidney cancer trial initiated in the second quarter of in addition  nexavar development costs reflect the ongoing pivotal phase kidney cancer trial  a phase trial in liver cancer initiated in the first quarter of and a phase trial in metastatic melanoma initiated in may  as well as several phase b and clinical trials 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million from the therapeutic virus program  which was terminated in the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials  and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will 
table of contents need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in  a net increase of million  or percent  from million in we did not expense employee stock based compensation prior to our adoption of fas r on january  in addition to the stock based compensation expense  the increase was primarily due to the establishment of our us nexavar sales force in the second half of and our marketing expenses relating to the nexavar launch 
offsetting this increase is a change in accounting presentation of our statement of operations to reflect the co promotion agreement by including the net expense from unconsolidated joint business line item 
our share of bayer s nexavar related marketing expenses is included in the net expense 
table of contents from unconsolidated joint business line item

under the new presentation only our direct selling  general and administrative expenses are included in the selling  general and administrative expenses line item 
our direct selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to the adoption of fas r  as well as the payroll related costs of our sales force and medical science liaisons who were hired in the second half of additionally  general and administrative costs  excluding stock based compensation  increased million primarily due to employee related costs as a result of headcount increases to support commercialization of nexavar 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or percent  from the increase primarily related to increased selling and marketing costs of million due to employee related costs for hiring our sales and marketing personnel as we established our commercial infrastructure  as well as third party costs incurred by onyx and bayer to support our product launch of nexavar in the us additionally  general and administrative costs increased million primarily due to employee related costs as a result of headcount increases to support our planned commercialization of nexavar 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  consulting  other third party costs  corporate functional expenses and allocations for overhead and occupancy costs

we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred losses  and we have relied primarily on public and private financing  combined with milestone payments we have received from our collaborators to fund our operations at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in of million is primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of million 
this use of cash was partially offset by net cash proceeds of from our october and november sales of equity securities under our committed equity financing  million from stock option exercises and the million milestone based advance received from bayer in january this million payment  in addition to million of milestones received in previous years  will be repayable to bayer from a portion of any of onyx s future profits and royalties 
if onyx does not receive any profits or royalties on any products  onyx will not have to repay bayer any creditable milestone based payments 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in of million was attributable to our public offering completed in november  which raised aggregate net cash proceeds of million  as well as million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants and  received from the redemption of our investment in syrxx 
these sources of cash were partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of  our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in in  the cash used primarily related to the net loss and payments of the year end and first  second and third quarter payables to bayer  our collaboration partner 
in  the cash was used primarily for co funding clinical development programs for nexavar  establishing sales and marketing infrastructure at onyx and bayer to prepare for the commercial launch of nexavar in the us  and for third party pre commercial marketing activities 
in  the cash was used primarily for co funding the clinical development program with bayer for nexavar 
expenditures for capital equipment amounted to  in   in and million in capital expenditures in and were primarily for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
capital expenditures in were primarily for upgrades to our information technology equipment and leasehold improvements and furniture related to our move in december into our new corporate headquarters 
we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of up to million in primarily for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment and information technology software 
in september  we secured a commitment for up to million in a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth opportunity ltd 
or azimuth 
during the two year term of the commitment  onyx may sell at its discretion registered shares of its common stock to azimuth at a discount to the market price ranging from to 
onyx will determine  at its sole discretion  the timing and amount of any sales of stock  subject to certain conditions 
in october and november  azimuth purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale of these shares after deducting our offering expenses 
we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations into however  if we change our development plans  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
in addition  we anticipate that our co development costs for the nexavar program may increase over the next several years as we continue our share of funding the clinical development program and prepare for the potential product launches throughout the world 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the co funding of the program in future periods through and beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or 
table of contents eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own

fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority and provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months we did not hold any derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past
