item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and part ii  item a  controls and procedures 
the independent investigation of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatement activities have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal and other expenses totaling million in  and we expect to incur additional costs in the future periods 
as a result of the events described above  we have become subject to a number of significant risks  each of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  described below 
see item a we face risks related to possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option grant practices  which could require significant management time and attention  and could require us to pay fines or other penalties  we face litigation risks relating to our stock option grant practices that could have a material adverse effect on the company  because of the delayed filing of our periodic reports  we face delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
delisting would adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  because of the delayed filing of our periodic reports  we are ineligible to register our securities on form s  which may increase our transaction costs and delay our ability to quickly access the capital markets  alleged defaults of our convertible senior debentures  if not cured  may result in an acceleration of the debentures 
we face risks related to possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option grant practices  which could require significant management time and attention  and could require us to pay fines or other penalties 
in connection with the special committee investigation of our historical stock option grant practices and related informal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission sec  we have voluntarily continued to keep the sec advised of the issues identified during the investigation  its progress and our conclusions 
although no formal inquiry has been made by any regulatory agency with respect to the investigation and the related restatement  we are unable to predict whether any such formal inquiry will be initiated or what consequences  if any  that any such further inquiry may have on us 
any regulatory inquiry could result in substantial legal expenses  divert management s attention from other business concerns and harm our business 
if a regulatory agency were to commence legal action  it is possible that we could be required to pay significant penalties and or fines and could become subject to administrative orders 
any regulatory action could result in the filing of additional restatements of our prior financial statements or require that we take other actions 
while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the revised measurement dates for option grants  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past option grant measurement date adjustments  and there is a risk that any sec inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec or otherwise take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  the sec may issue additional guidance on disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past option grant measurement date adjustments that may require us to amend this filing or prior filings with the sec to provide additional disclosures pursuant to this guidance 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
see item a because of the delayed filing of our periodic reports  we face delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
delisting would adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
furthermore  if we are subject to 
table of contents adverse findings in any of these matters  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we face litigation risks relating to our stock option grant practices that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a number of purported shareholder derivative complaints have been filed against us in connection with our historical stock option grant practices 
the complaints allege  among other things  that certain of our current and past officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to the company by improperly backdating certain grants of stock options to officers and directors of the company and violating the terms of our stock option plans  violating generally accepted accounting practices and producing and disseminating statements that improperly accounted for the options and concealed the alleged backdating 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for a further description of these proceedings 
the defense of these lawsuits has resulted  and will likely result in the future  in significant expense and the continued diversion of management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives 
an unfavorable outcome in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of these lawsuits may not be covered by insurance 
under the bylaws  charter and indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our officers and directors  we are required  subject to certain limited qualifications  to indemnify  and advance expenses to  our current and former executive officers and directors in connection with their participation in proceedings arising out of their service to us 
there can be no assurance that such payments in connection with the derivative actions will not be material 
additionally  in the future  we may be the subject of additional private or government actions related to our option grant practices 
litigation is time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation  as well as its costs  are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
because of the delayed filing of our periodic reports  we face delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
delisting would adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
as a result of the delayed filing of our periodic reports with the sec  on november   we received a nasdaq staff determination notice stating that we were not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c due to our failure to timely file our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   and that our common stock is  therefore  subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
we received additional nasdaq staff determination notices with respect to our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march  and june  we requested and subsequently attended a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel the panel to appeal the staff determination and presented a plan to cure the filing deficiencies and regain compliance 
the panel granted our request for continued listing on the nasdaq global select market  subject to certain conditions which we were unable to meet because of the then ongoing independent investigation of our historical stock option grants 
as a result  the panel notified us that it had determined to delist our securities  which ordinarily would have resulted in the suspension of our securities effective on may  however  the nasdaq listing and hearing review council the listing council  pursuant to its discretionary authority under marketplace rule b  called for review the decision of the panel regarding our case and stayed any action by the panel to suspend our securities from trading on the nasdaq global select market pending further action by the listing council 

table of contents on july   we provided the listing council with an additional submission for its consideration  and requested that the listing council exercise its discretionary authority  pursuant to marketplace rule b  in favor of granting us an additional extension to regain compliance with nasdaq s filing requirement  as set forth in marketplace rule c 
on august   the listing council notified us that it had determined to exercise its discretionary authority  under nasdaq marketplace rule b  to grant us an exception to demonstrate compliance with all of the nasdaq global select market continued listing requirements through october  if we do not become current in our public filings with the sec by october   our securities will be suspended from trading on the nasdaq global select market at the opening of business on october  if the panel determines that we have not demonstrated compliance with all of the nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq global select market 
if we are delisted  our common stock would subsequently be transferred to the national quotation service bureau  or pink sheets 
the trading of our common stock on the pink sheets may reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
in addition  the trading of our common stock on the pink sheets will materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
securities that trade on the pink sheets are no longer eligible for margin loans  and a company trading on the pink sheets cannot avail itself of federal preemption of state securities or blue sky laws  which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances  including pursuant to employee option plans  stock purchase plans and private or public offerings of securities 
if we are delisted in the future from the nasdaq global select market and transferred to the pink sheets  there may also be other negative implications  including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our company 
alternatively  we may apply for listing on another exchange 
however  there is no assurance that we will meet the requirements for initial listing or maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of such an exchange 
because of the delayed filing of our periodic reports  we are ineligible to register our securities on form s  which may increase transaction costs and delay our ability to quickly access the capital markets 
as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended september   annual report on form k for the year ended december  and quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march  and june   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities and exchange act of for a period of twelve months and any portion of a month from the due date of the last untimely report 
we may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete certain acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 
alleged defaults of our convertible senior debentures  if not cured  may result in an acceleration of the debentures 
in june  we issued million in convertible senior debentures due in we have received notices from the trustee under the indenture governing the debentures regarding certain requirements to file with the trustee copies of annual and quarterly reports that we are required to file with the sec 
most recently  we received a notice from the trustee asserting that  because we did not file our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended september  within days of receiving a previous notice from the trustee  an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture 
this notice further asserted that  if the deficiency related to the filing of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and quarterly report on form q for the quarterly periods ended march  and june  is not 
table of contents cured within days  additional events of default will occur under the indenture 
under the terms of the indenture  we have days to cure a default 
if we do not cure a default within that period  either the trustee or the holders of at least of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding debentures may accelerate the maturity of the debentures  causing the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest to be immediately due and payable  to date  none has done so 
the trustee has not accelerated the maturity of the debentures  but reserved the right to seek the remedies allowed in the indenture 
as of june   we had approximately million of cash and investments 
accordingly  we believe that  if the debentures were accelerated  we will have adequate financial resources to pay any unpaid principal and interest due on the debentures 
we believe that as a result of the filing of our periodic reports on october   any purported default under the debentures has been fully cured and is no longer continuing  and neither the trustee nor any holders of the debentures will have any ability to accelerate the maturity of the debentures from and after october  we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem customers and the loss of any of these oem customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
a significant portion of our revenues are and have been generated by sales of our printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of oems 
for example  canon and xerox each contributed over of our revenues for the year ended december  and together accounted for approximately of those revenues during the same period 
during the fiscal year ended december   canon  xerox  and konica minolta each contributed over of our revenues and together accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenues and there is a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem customers for a significant portion of our controller revenues in future periods 
in addition  our oem customers have developed  and may continue to develop  their own controller products  which may compete directly with our product  which may adversely affect our revenues 
accordingly  if we lose or experience reduced sales to an important oem customer  we will have difficulty replacing the revenue previously generated from such customers with sales to new or existing oem customers and our controller revenue will likely decline significantly 
the market for our super wide format printers is very competitive 
the printing equipment industry is extremely competitive 
our vutek products compete against several companies that market digital printing systems based on electrostatic  drop on demand and continuous drop on demand inkjet  airbrush and other technologies and printers utilizing solvent and uv curable ink 
two of our largest competitors  scitex vision and inca  were recently acquired by hewlett packard hp and dai nippon screen screen  respectively 
both hp and screen have greater resources to develop new products and technologies and market those products  as well as acquire or develop critical components at lower costs  which would provide a competitive advantage 
they could also exert downward pressure on product pricing to gain market share 
we have also witnessed the recent growth of local chinese and korean markets where local competitors are developing  manufacturing and selling inexpensive printers  mainly to the local chinese and korean markets 
these chinese and korean manufacturers have also begun penetrating the international market and have partnered with other super wide format printer manufacturers 
our ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside of our control  including the price  performance and acceptance of our current printers and any products we develop in the future 
we also face competition from existing conventional wide format and super wide format printing methods  including screen printing and offset printing 
our competitors could develop new products  with existing or new technology  that could be more competitive in our market than our printers 
we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with any such products 

table of contents we face strong competition in the market for printing supplies such as ink 
we compete with independent manufacturers in the ink market 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to remain the exclusive or even principal ink supplier for our printers 
the loss of ink sales to our installed base of printers could adversely impact our revenues and gross margins 
we could also experience an overall reduction in price within the ink markets  which would also adversely affect our gross margins 
while solvent inks are relatively easy to replicate and additional manufacturers could increase pricing competition or divert customers away from us  we believe our uv curable ink is more difficult to replicate and also represents a superior long term growth opportunity 
we do not typically have long term purchase contracts with our oem customers and our oem customers have in the past and could at any time in the future  reduce or cease purchasing products from us  harming our operating results and business 
with the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations  we typically do not have long term volume purchase contracts with our oem customers  including canon  xerox and konica minolta and they are not obligated to purchase products from us 
accordingly  our customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether 
in the past  some of our oem customers have elected to develop products on their own  rather than purchase our products and we expect that customers will continue to make such elections in the future 
in addition  because our oem customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell  any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers and any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general  including reduced demand for the products sold by our oem customers  would likely harm our results of operations 
for example  several of our customers have in the past experienced serious financial difficulties which led to a decline in sales of our products to these customers 
if any significant customers should face such difficulties in the future  our operating results could be harmed through  among other things  decreased sales volumes and write offs of accounts receivables and inventory related to products we have manufactured for these customers products 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance based on projected sales levels and margins  sales forecasts from our oem customers and product development programs 
a substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less and our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty 
accordingly  if sales to our oem customers are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall in revenues on operating results may be increased by our inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for this shortfall 
we rely on our oem customers to develop and sell products incorporating our controller technologies and if they fail to successfully develop and sell these products  or curtail or cease the use of our technologies in their products  our business will be harmed 
we rely upon our oem customers to develop new products  applications and product enhancements utilizing our controller technologies in a timely and cost effective manner 
our continued success in the controller industry depends upon the ability of these oem customers to utilize our technologies while meeting changing end user customer needs and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
however  we cannot provide assurance that our oem customers will effectively meet these challenges 
these oem customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us and we cannot provide assurance that they will continue to carry our products 
for example  our oem customers have incorporated into their products the technologies of other companies or internally developed technologies in addition to  or instead of  our technologies and will likely continue to do so in the future 
if our oem customers do not effectively and successfully market products containing our technologies  our revenue will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our oem customers work closely with us to develop products that are specific to each oem customer s copiers and printers 
many of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development  quality testing  marketing and other tasks with our oem customers 
we cannot control our oem customers 
table of contents development efforts or the timing of these efforts and coordinating with our oem customers may cause delays in our own product development efforts that are outside of our control 
if our oem customers delay the release of their products  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our oem customers product needs for their specific copiers and printers  as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products 
ongoing economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends significantly on the overall demand for information technology products such as ours that enable printing of digital data  which in turn depends on a variety of macro and micro economic conditions 
in addition  our revenue growth and profitability in our inkjet business depends on demand and spending for advertising and marketing products and programs  which also depends on a variety of macro and micro economic conditions 
delays or reductions in information technology spending  which has occurred in the past  could cause a decline in demand for our products and services and consequently harm our business  operating results  financial condition  prospects and stock price 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors  which could adversely affect our stock price 
stock prices of high technology companies such as ours tend to be volatile as a result of various factors  including variations in operating results and  consequently  fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
factors that have caused our operating results and share price to fluctuate in the past and that may cause future fluctuations include varying demand for our products  due to seasonality  oem customer product development and marketing efforts  oem customer financial and operational condition and general economic conditions  shifts in customer demand to lower cost products  success and timing of new product introductions by us and our oem customers and the performance of our products generally  success and timing of new inkjet product introductions  volatility in foreign exchange rates  changes in interest rates and availability of bank or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers  price reductions by us and our competitors  which may be exacerbated by competitive pressures caused by economic conditions generally  substitution of third party inks for our own ink products by users of our super wide format inkjet printers  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders or projects  availability of key components and licenses  including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers  the performance of third party manufacturers and the status of our relationships with our key suppliers  potential excess or shortage of employees and location of research and development centers  changes in our product mix such as shifts from higher revenue or gross margin products to lower revenue or gross margin products such as our inkjet products  costs associated with complying with any applicable governmental regulations  cost associated with possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option granting practices and remedial measures we are taking with respect to our historical stock option granting practices  acquisitions and integration of new businesses  costs related to our entry into new markets  such as commercial printing and office equipment service automation  
table of contents general economic conditions  commencement of litigation or adverse results in pending litigation  including the shareholder derivative suits related to our historical stock option granting practices  and other risks described herein 
we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be harmed 
the digital printing marketplace is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes 
we compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products and technologies  including our oem customers themselves 
although we attempt to develop and support innovative products that end customers demand  products or technologies developed by competing suppliers  including our own oem customers  could render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
while many of our oem customers incorporate our technologies into their end products on an exclusive basis  we do not have any formal agreements that prevent these oem customers from offering alternative products that do not incorporate our technologies 
if  as has occurred in the past  an oem customer offers products incorporating technology from alternative suppliers instead of  or in addition to  products incorporating our technologies  our market share could decrease  which would likely reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  many oems in the printer and copier industry  including most of our oem customers  internally develop and sell products that compete directly with our current products 
these oems have significant investments in their existing solutions and have substantial resources that may enable them to develop or improve  more quickly than us  technologies similar to ours that are compatible with their own products 
our oem customers have in the past marketed and likely will continue in the future to market  their own internal technologies and solutions in addition to ours  even when their technologies and solutions are less advanced  have lower performance or cost more than our products 
given the significant financial  marketing and other resources of our larger oem customers and other significant oems in the imaging industry who are not our customers  we may not be able to successfully compete against these oems selling similar products that they develop internally 
if we cannot compete successfully against the oems internally developed products  we will lose sales and market share in those areas where the oems choose to compete and our business will be harmed 
entry into new markets or distribution channels could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenue 
we continue to explore opportunities to develop or acquire product lines different from our current controllers  such as print management software  document scanning solutions and inkjet printers 
we expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services  which will increase our operating expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services or if we will generate sufficient revenues from these activities to offset the additional operating expenses we incur 
in addition  even if we are able to introduce new products or services  if customers do not accept these new products or services or if we are not able to price such products or services competitively  our operating results will likely suffer 
we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products 
most of our current products include software that we must license from adobe 
specifically  we are required to obtain separate licenses from adobe for the right to use adobe postscript software in each type of copier or printer used with a fiery controller 
although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript software when required  adobe is not required to and we cannot be certain that adobe will  grant 
table of contents future licenses to adobe postscript software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  in order to obtain licenses from adobe  adobe requires that we obtain from them quality assurance approvals for our products that use adobe software 
although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurances from adobe  we cannot be certain adobe will grant us such approvals in the future 
if adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe licenses are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise materially impaired  we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate adobe postscript software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products and the loss of any of these suppliers could adversely affect our business 
certain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components and inkjet print heads for our super wide format printers 
we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our component suppliers and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis 
if we are unable to continue to procure these sole sourced components from our current suppliers  we will have to qualify other sources  if possible  or design our products so that they no longer require these components 
in addition  these suppliers may be concentrated within similar industries or geographic locations  which could potentially exacerbate these risks 
we cannot provide assurance that other sources of these components exist or will be willing to supply us on reasonable terms or at all  or that we will be able to design around these components 
therefore any unavailability of supply of these components could harm our business 
because the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we have been in the past and may in the future be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet demand 
further  as has occurred in the past  in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize  we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete 
in order to meet projected demand  we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of inventory obsolescence  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  the market prices and availability of certain components  particularly memory and intel designed components  which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products  have fluctuated significantly in the past 
such fluctuations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including a reduction in gross margins 
we are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors  with whom we do not have long term contracts  to manufacture and deliver products to our customers and the loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business 
we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products and we do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors 
we rely on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products to be sold to our customers and while we closely monitor our subcontractors performance we cannot assure you that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner 
in the past a weakened economy led to the dissolution  bankruptcy or consolidation of some of the subcontractors who are able to manufacture our products  decreasing the available number of subcontractors 
if the available number of subcontractors were to again decrease  it is possible that we would not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner or at all  particularly if demand for our products increases 
the existence of fewer subcontractors may also reduce our negotiating leverage potentially resulting in higher product costs 
difficulties experienced by our subcontractors  including financial problems and the inability to make or ship our products or fix quality assurance problems  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we decide to change subcontractors  we could experience delays in finding  qualifying and commencing business with new subcontractors which would result in both delay in delivery of our products and also potentially the cancellation of orders for our products 
a high concentration of our fiery controllers is manufactured at a single subcontractor location  celestica in toronto  ontario  canada 
should 
table of contents celestica experience any inability to  or refuse to manufacture or deliver product from this location our business  financial condition and operations could be harmed 
since we do not maintain long term agreements with our subcontractors  any of our subcontractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit such subcontractors from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability of such subcontractors from filling our orders in a timely manner 
in such event  we may not be able to find suitable replacement subcontractors and our business  financial condition and operations would likely be harmed 
we may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence related to our super wide format inkjet printers and ink 
we procure raw materials and build our super wide printers and ink products based on our sales forecasts 
if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products we may end up with excess inventory  or we may lose sales because we do not have the correct products available for sale 
if we have excess printers or other products we may have to lower prices to stimulate demand 
we may also run the risk that our inventory of raw materials may become obsolete 
our ink products have a defined shelf life 
if we do not sell the ink before the end of its shelf life it will no longer be sellable and will have to be expensed 
if we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees  we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion 
we depend upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills 
we are headquartered in the silicon valley and additionally have research and development offices in india 
competition in both locations has historically been intense amongst companies hiring engineering and technical professionals 
in times of professional labor imbalances  it has in the past and is likely in the future to be difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people 
there are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the silicon valley and our operations in india that may try to hire our employees 
the movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees 
if we do not offer competitive compensation  we may not be able to recruit or retain employees 
we offer a broad based equity compensation plan based on granting options and restricted stock from stockholder approved plans in order to be competitive in the labor market 
if we cannot offer equity awards when necessary to enable us to offer compensation competitive with those offered by other companies seeking the same employees  it may be difficult for us to hire and retain skilled employees 
with the january  adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all equity awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans related to all our stock based compensation plans based on estimated fair values  we anticipate a non cash reduction to net income after income taxes that might limit our ability to successfully hire  compensate  and retain employees which could affect our ability to develop products  meet demand for existing products  or in other ways harm the results of operations 
on november   we notified participants under our equity compensation plans of the potential suspension of our registration statements on form s covering the securities issued under these plans as of november  during the suspension period  participants have not been able to exercise options granted or purchase employee stock or have payroll deductions made under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
our acquisition of vutek in june increased the chance that we will experience additional bad debt expense 
our oem customers are typically large profitable customers who present little credit risk to us 
our apps and inkjet business sells via a direct sales force to a broader base of customers  many of whom are smaller and 
table of contents potentially less credit worthy 
in addition  many of these customers are located overseas in many countries where it may be hard to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise 
because of our recent acquisitions we now sell our products directly to distributors and to the end user 
if we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force  sales and revenues could decline 
we have traditionally sold our products to our oem partners  who in turn sold the product to the end user 
our marketing focused on manufacturers and distributors of the manufacturers equipment  not on the end user of the product 
we now sell our professional printing applications and our inkjet printers and ink to the end user 
if we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force and develop a marketing program that can reach the end users  we are likely to see a decline in revenues from those products 
we have made acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders 
acquisitions may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources 
as part of this effort  we have in the past made  and will likely continue to make  acquisitions of other companies or other companies assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  alternatively  acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash such as our acquisition of vutek will reduce our cash reserves  difficulties in integration of operations  employees  technologies  or products and the related diversion of management time and effort to accomplish successful integration  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions  possible write downs of impaired assets  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  possible expense overruns  an adverse reaction by customers  suppliers or partners of the acquired company or efi  the risk of changes in ratings by stock analysts  potential litigation surrounding transactions or the prior actions of the acquired company  such as the printcafe litigation  the inability to protect or secure technology rights  and increases in operating costs 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and we cannot provide assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business  operating results  financial condition  or stock price 
we face risks from currency fluctuations 
approximately million and million of our revenue from the sale of products for the years ended december  and  respectively  came from sales outside the americas  primarily to europe and japan 
we expect that sales outside the americas will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 

table of contents given the significance of our non us sales to our total product revenue  we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies and numerous southeast asian currencies 
we typically invoice our customers in us dollars and this may result in our products becoming more expensive in the local currency of our customers  thereby reducing our ability to sell our products 
when we do invoice our customers in local currencies  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the us dollar 
in addition  we have a substantial number of international employees which creates material operating costs denominated in foreign currencies 
in europe  where we have a significant presence  our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses have risen in part due to the weakened us dollar 
we have attempted to limit or hedge these exposures through operational strategies where we have considered it appropriate in the past  although no hedging activities occurred in our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
in  the impact from currency exchange differences was not material 
we face risks from our international operations 
we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations 
changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations that may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales 
trade legislation in either the united states or other countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance laws or other trade policies  could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets 
some of our sales to international customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the united states department of commerce doc and certain transactions require prior approval of the doc 
changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals  permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues  business and operations 
any violations could result in fines and penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
moreover  local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states 
we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations  which may be substantially different from those in the united states 
in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such united states laws may be customary  will not take actions in violation of our policies 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other risks include natural disasters and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region 
in addition  many countries in which we derive revenues do not currently have comprehensive and highly developed legal systems  particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights  which  among other things  can result in the prevalence of infringing products and counterfeit goods in certain countries  which could harm our business and reputation 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
we have patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications 
table of contents or from any future applications  or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot be certain that any patents that have been or may in the future be issued to us  or which we license from third parties  or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents  licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information 
in addition  as different areas of our business change or mature  from time to time we evaluate our patent portfolio and make decisions either to pursue or not to pursue specific patents and patent applications related to such areas 
choosing not to pursue certain of our patents  patentable applications and failing to file applications for potentially patentable inventions  may harm our business by  among other things  enabling our competitors to more effectively compete with us  reducing the potential claims we can bring against third parties for patent infringement and limiting our potential defenses to intellectual property claims brought by third parties 
litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation 
third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights 
such claims have in the past resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation and could do so in the future 
such claims and any related litigation  whether or not we are successful in the litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot assure you that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be subject to environmental related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents 
we conduct our business operations that involve the use of certain hazardous materials at two separate locations 
at these facilities  we mix ink used in some of our printers with solvents and other hazardous materials 
those materials are subject to various governmental regulations relating to their transfer  handling  packaging  use and disposal 
we store the ink at warehouses worldwide  including europe and the united states  and shipping companies ship it at our direction 
we face potential responsibility for problems such as spills that may arise when we ship the ink to customers 
while we customarily obtain insurance coverage typical for this kind of risk  if we fail to comply with these laws or an accident involving our ink waste or solvents occurs  then our business and financial results could be harmed 
future sales of our hardware products in european union member nations eu could be limited due to the enactment of the eu restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs 
since july  forward  new electrical and electronic equipment sold into eu nations must not contain lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyls pbbs or polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes 
these must be replaced by other non or less than toxic substances 
manufacturers must comply with significant  and potentially costly  compliance requirements in order to meet the rohs deadline 
some of our products may not have been converted before the deadline 
as a result  we may not be allowed to sell those products in the eu until the products are made fully compliant  which could harm our business and financial results we could also incur additional costs and liabilities in connection with non compliant product recalls  regulatory fines and exclusion of non compliant products from certain markets 
our products may contain defects which are not discovered until after shipping 
our products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others 
our products may contain undetected errors and we have in the past discovered software and hardware errors in certain of our products after 
table of contents their introduction  resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such errors 
errors could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipment and any such errors could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenues 
in addition  errors in our products including errors in licensed third party software detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and our incurring additional expense  which could harm our operating results 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues 
maintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us 
there are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses  worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products 
although we take preventative measures to protect our products  and we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events  these procedures may not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products  to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitive products 
customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack  which could delay or reduce purchases of our products 
any of these actions or responses by customers could adversely affect our revenues 
system failures or system unavailability could harm our business 
we rely on our network infrastructure  internal technology systems and our internal and external websites for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
our hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from malicious code released into the public internet through recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs 
these systems are also subject to acts of vandalism and to potential disruption by actions or inactions of third parties 
any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes  floods or other natural disasters and public health risks 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development facilities  are located in the san francisco bay area  an area known for seismic activity 
this area has also experienced flooding in the past 
in addition  many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas including the san francisco bay area  taiwan and japan and are therefore subject to risk from natural disasters 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  flood or typhoon  could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our employees  suppliers and customers are located worldwide 
we face the risk that our employees  suppliers  or customers  either through travel or contact with other individuals  could become exposed to contagious diseases endemic to particular regions of the world 
in addition  governments in those regions have from time to time imposed quarantines and taken other actions in response to contagious diseases that could affect our operations 
if a significant number of employees  suppliers  or customers were unable to fulfill their obligations  due to contagious diseases  actions taken in response to contagious diseases  or other reasons  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
we are subject to numerous federal and state employment laws and may face claims in the future under such laws 
efi is subject to numerous federal and state employment laws  and from time to time efi faces claims by its employees and former employees under such laws 
in addition  the number of cases involving alleged violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws has recently increased in the software industry 
the outcome of these types of cases is highly fact specific and the law  particularly in california  is still evolving 
although there are no pending or threatened claims under wage and hour laws against efi  we cannot assure you 
table of contents that claims under such laws or other employment related laws will not be attempted in the future against efi  nor can we predict the likely impact of any such claims on efi  or that  if asserted  efi would be able to successfully resolve any such claims without incurring significant expenses 
we may be subject to the risk of loss due to fire because the materials we use in the manufacturing process of our inks are flammable 
we use flammable materials in the manufacturing processes of our inks and may therefore be subject to the risk of loss arising from fires 
the risk of fire associated with these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
we own certain facilities that manufacture our inks  which increases our exposure to such risk in case these facilities are destroyed 
we maintain insurance policies to reduce losses caused by fire  including business interruption insurance 
if one or more of these facilities is damaged or otherwise ceases operations as a result of a fire  it would reduce manufacturing capacity and  consequently  may reduce revenues and adversely affect our business 
the value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate volatility 
we have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to volatility if market interest rates fluctuate 
we attempt to limit this exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause volatility in our investment portfolio value 
our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the twelve month period ended december   the price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results  our failure to meet analyst expectations  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  announcements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  changes in general economic conditions  terrorist attacks and the effects of military engagements or natural disasters  changes in the rating of our debentures or other securities  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies  commencement of litigation or adverse results in pending litigation  including shareholder derivative suits related to our historical stock option practices  commencement of possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option grant practices  and a potentially high volume of sales of our stock by our employees once we have filed all periodic reports with the sec resulting from an expected demand to sell equity held by employees  and the prior unavailability of an effective registration statement covering the issuance of such employee equity 

table of contents because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
there can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price 
the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock 
additionally  we are permitted to and could discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
for example  we suspended our stock repurchase program in connection with our investigation of our historical stock option grant practices 
under regulations required by the sarbanes oxley act of  an adverse opinion on internal controls over financial reporting could be issued by our auditors  and this could have a negative impact on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and assess on an on going basis the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
our auditors  an independent registered public accounting firm  are required to attest to and audit both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and management s assessment of the design and the effectiveness of its internal controls for financial reporting 
although no known material weaknesses are believed to exist at this time  it is possible that material weaknesses could be identified 
if we are unable to remediate the weaknesses  our management would be required to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and our auditors would be required to issue an adverse opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting 
it is uncertain what impact an adverse opinion would have on our stock price 
in addition to their inherent limitations  internal controls over financial reporting and the audit of such controls by our auditors may not prevent or detect misstatements  errors  omissions  or fraud 
a reduction in our net income as reported on our financial statements could increase the likelihood of identifying a material weakness in our internal controls 
the threshold for determining whether or not we have a material weakness in our internal controls and procedures as defined by the sarbanes oxley act is  in part  based on our generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  net income 
lowered gaap net income  with an associated lowered materiality threshold  may increase our risk of having to disclose control weaknesses 
for example  continued acquisitions  and the associated amortization of intangibles  will increase our amortization expenses and in the future may lower our gaap earnings which would result in a lower materiality threshold for internal control testing 
a lower materiality threshold requires us to test more areas of the business 
as the number of areas tested increases  the statistical chance of discovering a material weakness increases 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in june  we issued million in convertible senior debentures due in during the period the debentures are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the debentures of approximately million per year in interest payments  payable semi annually 
in addition  beginning june   we could be required to pay contingent interest of if during any six month period from june to november and 
table of contents december to may  the average market price of the debentures for the five trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant nine month period equals or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
due to our failure to timely file our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended september   march  and june  and this annual report on form k  we received notices of default of certain covenants of the indenture 
for a more detailed description of the default  see item a alleged defaults of our convertible senior debentures  if not cured  may result in acceleration of the debentures 
our debt service obligations related to the debentures include the following redemption and repurchase terms that could also affect our cash position on or after june   we may redeem the debentures for cash at any time as a whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debenture to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  on june  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase in cash  and a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we may add lines of credit and obtain other long term debt and mortgage financing to finance capital expenditures in the future 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  as we are required to make interest payments and maintain compliance with financial covenants contained in the debentures regardless of such external conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing due to covenants contained in the debentures and the existing leverage evidenced by the debentures  require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt

item legal proceedings legal proceedings as more fully discussed below  from time to time we may be involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities law  intellectual property  employment matters and other claims or litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our specific litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes  assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and ranges of possible loss on the pending litigation matters  we are unable to predict with certainty the precise liability that could finally result from a range of possible unfavorable outcomes

leggett platt  inc and l p property management company v 
vutek  inc in may  prior to efi s acquisition of vutek  leggett platt  inc l p  and its patent holding subsidiary brought a patent infringement action against vutek in the united states district court in the eastern district of missouri 
after conducting extensive discovery  efi moved for summary judgment that the asserted patent is invalid and not infringed 
after several months of reviewing the evidence  on december   the court granted efi s summary judgment motion and ruled that all of l p s asserted patent claims were invalid on multiple grounds 
the court found that each asserted patent claim was obvious and already disclosed in vutek s own prior patents 
in addition to those two grounds for invalidity  the court also found l p s patent claims invalid because the l p patent claims were vague and indefinite in view of the patent claim interpretations suggested by l p 
the court also granted efi s motion to recover its costs from l p 
l p filed a notice of appeal  and efi moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of proper certification from the trial court 
the court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington  dc granted efi s motion and dismissed l p s first appeal 
after obtaining a final certification from the trial court  l p filed a new notice of appeal 
efi will continue to vigorously contest l p s second attempt at an appeal

potential violations uncovered during our compliance review were voluntarily disclosed to bis in november for vutek and december for efi 
additionally  we provided bis with detailed reports of our compliance review findings and supplemental information in march for vutek and may for efi 
the areas of possible non compliance found in the internal review relate to deemed exports of controlled encryption source code and or technology to foreign nationals of syria and iran  exports of printers and other products with encryption functionality before completion of encryption reviews by bis and statistical reporting errors on some export declarations 
at present  we believe that these matters will be resolved solely with administrative penalties 
however  there is no assurance that these matters will not have an unforeseen outcome that could impair our ability to export product outside of the united states and canada

table of contents the restatements result from an independent investigation by a special committee of the company s board of directors the special committee into our historical stock option granting practices 
information relating to the special committee investigation has been disclosed in current reports on form k filed on october  and june  with the securities and exchange commission sec 
special committee investigation of historical stock option practices in may  citigroup published a number of reports  one of which identified us as having well timed option grants among seven companies in our sector  and therefore  as being at risk for greater scrutiny of our option granting practices 
the report identified certain stock options granted to executive officers of the company on selected dates during the years   and on august   the first of several shareholder derivative suits was filed  alleging that certain of our current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty in connection with the administration and accounting associated with stock option grants to officers 
on october   our management reviewed information compiled by our litigation counsel  wilson sonsini goodrich and rosati wsgr and discussed the matter with the chairman of the audit committee of the board of directors 
the board of directors special committee  consisting of directors selected to carry out an independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices  retained independent counsel and forensic accounting advisors to assist with their investigation 
completion of special committee investigation of historical stock option practices on june   the special committee  with its independent counsel and forensic accountants  reported their completion of the investigation to management and the board of directors 
the special committee investigation focused on our historical stock option granting practices from the company s initial public offering on october  through in particular  they reviewed in detail unique company wide grant dates and developed observations related to each of the grants on those specific dates 
the special committee s advisors worked in excess of a collective  professional hours 
the work included conducting interviews of current and former directors  officers  employees  and advisors to the company 
collecting documents from current and former directors  officers  and employees  files from certain company servers  and documents from outside legal counsel  among other sources 
in total  the special committee collected approximately million pages of hard copy and electronic documents 
reviewing approximately million pages of hard copy and electronic documents 
analyzing each option grant based on its price  the number of options  and other relevant information 
performing extensive analytics 
the special committee found that a substantial number of the grants to existing officers  directors and employees were priced on dates coinciding with our low stock price for the month  and  in some instances  the quarter 
information collected during the investigation suggests that  prior to  many such option grants were priced with the benefit of a look back at historical stock prices  with such look backs ranging up to several weeks 
the special committee found that grants to newly hired employees  dated april through october  were typically priced with an effective date coinciding with a low stock price for a given period 

table of contents based on its investigation  the special committee concluded  among other things  that we lacked contemporaneous evidence supporting a number of the recorded option grant dates 
the affected grants included grants to newly hired employees  employees joining efi in connection with one or more acquisition  and existing employees  officers  and directors 
management s review of the investigative forensic evidence provided by the special committee the special committee provided to management forensic evidence collected during the investigation in order for us to reassess the original measurement dates selected for accounting purposes 
to review the forensic evidence  a systematic approach was developed for evaluating the historical measurement dates for new hire grants including grants to new hires related to acquisitions and company wide broad based grants to existing employees  officers  and directors and for determining the revised measurement date  if a revision was warranted 
on grant dates where we lacked strong contemporaneous evidence supporting the original grant date  our approach was subject to judgment and in some cases multiple reasonable assumptions were considered and multiple measurement dates could have been supported by the documents available to management 
we hired experienced accountants and financial reporting consultants to assist in management s review of the documentation provided by the special committee and to expand our review to all stock options and restricted stock awards granted in the review period 
our consultants worked collectively in excess of  hours 
in addition to the materials provided by the special committee  management conducted its own review of the following individual personnel and stock option files which we determined to be of interest  accounting records for fiscal years and supporting reports for stock based compensation  board of director and committee documentation and minutes  emails and the stock based compensation accounting database 
we have determined there were unique grant dates that required review as a result of the observations by the special committee 
those unique grant dates can be classified as grant dates for newly hired employees including new hires related to acquisitions and broad based grant dates 
based on the results of this review  we concluded that the original measurement date used for accounting purposes required revision in a number of cases 
this created a non cash intrinsic value equaling the difference between the exercise price fair market value of our stock on the original measurement date and the fair market value of our stock on the revised measurement date 

table of contents the table and chart below illustrate the total gross non cash intrinsic value in each year for which a revised measurement date was required amortization of the intrinsic value is not reflected in the table  these amounts are higher than the amounts ultimately recorded as compensation expense in the financial statements because they do not reflect reductions due to the accounting for forfeitures  cancellations  and income tax effects 
gross non cash intrinsic values for stock options in millions broad based grants modifications new hire grants total totals logo 
table of contents the original new hire measurement dates were evaluated based on the employee hire date and the specific look back period convention used to determine the original exercise price 
the revised measurement date was determined  with judgment by us  to be the last day of the look back period since it appeared from the available evidence that the number of shares and exercise price were both known on that date 
beginning in october  we modified our procedures to no longer use a look back period convention to determine the exercise price for new hire stock option grants and  as such  there were no material adjustments to the original measurement dates for new hires after that date 
the revised measurement dates for new hire grants resulted in approximately million of incremental gross non cash intrinsic value before accounting for forfeitures  cancellations  and the related income tax effects  all of which relates to measurement date revisions originating in periods prior to january broad based grants to employees  directors  and officers were evaluated using all available evidence to systematically evaluate the appropriateness of previously determined measurement dates 
we then applied judgment in determining whether the measurement dates of any of the unique grant dates under review required revision 
the revised measurement dates for broad based grants resulted in approximately million of incremental gross non cash intrinsic value before accounting for forfeitures  cancellations  and related tax effects  this entire amount relates to measurement date revisions originating in periods prior to january we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations beginning in through our fiscal year ended december  and provided the required pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  beginning in through our fiscal year ended december  under apb intrinsic value model  non cash stock based compensation expense non cash intrinsic value was required to be recognized for any option in which the exercise price was below the market price of our stock on the measurement date 
if  after our review and the revision of certain measurement dates  our stock options had an exercise price below the market price of our stock on the revised measurement date  we have recognized in the restated financial statements stock based compensation expense for the options under apb equal to the number of option shares  multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price of our stock on the revised measurement date 
that expense has been recognized over the vesting periods of the options on a straight line basis 
if a stock option was forfeited prior to vesting  the compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in prior periods was reversed  as was any remaining unamortized unearned stock based compensation associated with the forfeited stock options 
we also reviewed the accounting treatment for stock options related to employee terminations and separation agreements and other possible modification conditions 
prior to  modifications were accounted for under the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensations  which required that an award be re measured at the modification date and to record any incremental increase in intrinsic value as a compensation charge 
for modifications made in conjunction with employment terminations  the compensation charge was recognized immediately since the shares were fully vested and no additional services were required 
we evaluated modifications in relation to the original grant terms and changes to employee status to determine if modifications had been accounted for appropriately in our consolidated statement of operations  and determined that incremental gross compensation charges of million before income tax effect should be recorded related to modifications in or prior to in the past  we elected to modify the terms of stock option awards to certain employees  including officers  in a manner that provided the employee with a greater benefit than in the original award 
these modifications occurred on termination of employment to allow for additional vesting and or extension beyond our plan s standard exercise period of three months after termination 
of these charges  million involved a separation agreement executed in between us and our former chief executive 
table of contents officer and chairman of the board of directors 
another million involved a separation agreement in with a former vice president 
these two officer modifications accounted for million or approximately of the total modifications 
summary of adjustments for stock based compensation while the chart and table above illustrate the gross intrinsic value before forfeitures  cancellations and related income tax effects  the table below illustrates the stock based compensation expense impact to the consolidated statement of operations and the associated income tax provision benefit in the periods in which they were recorded 
we used a straight line method to amortize the gross intrinsic value over the vesting period and accounted for forfeitures and cancellations in the period they occurred 
in the aggregate  we recorded additional stock based compensation expense for the period through of approximately million with associated income tax benefits of million for a net expense of million related to stock based compensation

table of contents million and million  respectively originally recognized in were deferred at december  as part of the restatement resulting in an adjustment  net of taxes  of million in our statement of operations 
the contract revenue and related costs were subsequently recognized in for additional information regarding the restatement  please see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
related tax matters we also considered the application of section a of the internal revenue code to certain stock option grants where  under apb no 
 intrinsic value existed at the time of grant 
holders of options with revised measurement dates granted by us may be subject to adverse tax consequences  including a penalty tax under section a of the internal revenue code and  as applicable  similar penalty taxes under california and other state tax laws 
on july   we paid million under internal revenue service and california compliance programs on behalf of certain option holders who had already exercised affected options during for the additional taxes incurred under section a of the internal revenue code 
we also remitted an additional million to the internal revenue service and state tax agencies to cover any tax liabilities of our employees resulting from our payment of section a taxes on july  on their behalf 
we also considered the application of section m of the internal revenue code to stock option exercises by certain executive officers where  under apb no 
 intrinsic value existed at the time of grant 
section m limits the corporate tax deduction to million annually for any non performance based compensation paid to an affected executive officer 
the exercise of those options with intrinsic value at the time of grant will be considered non performance based compensation  and the resulting gains have been disallowed as a corporate tax deduction to the extent these amounts  when combined with all other non performance based compensation paid annually  exceed the annual million section m limitation 
we have recorded a charge of approximately million related to section m disallowances for the tax years to related proceedings for information on related proceedings see item legal proceedings 
overview key financial results for were as follows our consolidated revenues increased by approximately  or million  from million in to million for the year ended december  this was due primarily to the addition of the vutek product line in mid  which contributed million of the increase  and the october  addition of jetrion revenues 
those increases were offset by slight decreases in revenue from our controllers product revenues and the sale of the mobile workforce automation mwa business in june gross margins decreased to in versus in due to the inclusion of the vutek product line for a full year in versus seven months in  offsetting higher margins on our controllers line of products 
operating expenses as a percent of revenues decreased from in to in due to decreases in in process research and development ipr d expense recorded in connection with the acquisition of vutek and jetrion 
ipr d costs totaled and of revenue for and  respectively 
after excluding ipr d  operating expenses remained at of revenues 
interest and other income increased from of revenue in to of revenue in due to higher interest rates and higher invested balances and a million gain on sale of the mwa business 

table of contents our tax provision increased from of operating income in to of operating income in primarily due to a one time charge related to the migration of the non north american chipset product lines to our european headquarters

revenue for  we group our revenues as derived from three major categories 
the first category  controllers  is primarily made up of stand alone controllers  which connect digital copiers with computer networks  and embedded desktop controllers  bundled solutions and design licensed solutions primarily for the office market and commercial printing 
this category includes our fiery  splash  edox  and micropress color and black and white controller product line and also includes spares  scanning solutions  and field dispatching solutions previously considered a separate miscellaneous category 
the second category  inkjet products  consists of sales of the super wide format inkjet printers and inks  and parts and services revenue from our vutek and jetrion product lines which were acquired june  and october   respectively 
the third category  advanced professional print software  or apps  consists of software technology focused on printing workflow  print management information systems  proofing and web submission and job tracking tools 

table of contents our revenues by product category for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands years ended december  change revenue as restated as restated over as restated over as restated controller inkjet products advanced professional printing software   total revenue see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements to consolidated financial statements 
overview revenue was million in  compared to million in and million in  which resulted in a increase in versus and an increase in compared to the million increase in compared to was primarily due to a million increase in inkjet product revenues and a million increase in apps revenues  offset by a million decrease in controllers revenues 
inkjet revenue growth is from year over year growth of the business and also from the inclusion of a full year s results for vutek in versus only a partial year s results in controller revenues in our controller category  the decrease in versus of million was primarily due to the sale of the mwa business in the second quarter of which contributed a million decline in revenue year over year 
the controller product revenues decreased million in as compared to due to the timing of product introductions by our oem s in the second half of our controller product revenues are heavily dependent on when oem s introduce and ship their products since our controllers are part of the printing equipment they sell 
though revenue was lower than  the second half revenues in actually increased over the second half revenues of inkjet products revenues inkjet revenues were million in as compared to million in our results include seven months of vutek revenues since its acquisition in june and our results include months of jetrion revenues and a full year of vutek revenues 
inkjet revenues would have increased on a pro forma basis if revenues included vutek pre acquisition revenues 
approximately million of inkjet product revenues were generated from ink sales versus million in advanced professional print software revenues the advanced professional print software category increased in over primarily due to a million increase in revenues from packaged software solutions  which are sold with new controllers and to existing customers 
within this category are the products we acquired from printcafe and best gmbh as well as 
table of contents certain software products that were developed by efi to enhance our controller products  such as our graphic arts package and products to optimize the workflow in print shops such as oneflow and balance 
the software applications in this category generate higher margins  favorably impacting our margins 
we continue to see strong market acceptance of these products and we believe we will experience further incremental growth 
we believe that price reductions for all of our products may affect revenues in the future 
we have made and may in the future make price reductions for our products in order to drive demand and remain competitive 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
if we are not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
revenues by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change as restated as restated over as restated over as restated americas europe japan other international locations   total see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from each geographic area represented a roughly equal percentage of total revenues for versus revenue growth in both and across all geographic regions was primarily driven by the addition of the vutek portion of the inkjet products line in june and to a lesser extent  industrial inkjet products from the acquisition of jetrion 
in the individual regions  inkjet product revenues in represented   and of revenue in the americas  europe  japan and other international locations  respectively 
overall revenue in the americas and europe regions increased in versus  due to the inclusion of vutek for the full year of versus seven months in  and stronger demand for our controller product lines in these regions 
japan region had strong growth due to strong design license sales to oem customers 
americas region was negatively impacted by the sale of the mobile workforce automation mwa product line in the second quarter of shipments to some of our us oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn sell through to other locations 
we believe that non us sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported because accurate data is difficult to obtain 
we expect that non us sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
a substantial portion of our revenue over the years has been attributable to sales of products through our oem customers and independent distributor channels 
for the year ended december   two customers canon and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   canon  konica minolta and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
we have shown a continued decrease in our dependency on the oem business and in the fourth quarter of  of our revenues were from non oem sources 

table of contents the decreasing trend in oem dependency is attributable to the addition of the inkjet products business where most of the revenue is generated from sales to distributors and direct customers 
no assurance can be given that our relationships with distributors and direct customers will continue or that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing the number of our oem customers or the size of our existing oem relationships 
several of our oem customers have reduced their purchases from us at various times in the past and any customer could do so in the future as there are no contractual obligations by most of our oems to purchase our products at all  or in significant amounts 
such reductions have occurred in the past and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we expect that if we increase our revenues from vutek and our advance professional print software  the percentage of our revenue that comes from individual oems will continue to decrease 
we continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of controllers and controller products and other new product lines and to distribute those new products to or through current and new oem customers  distribution partners  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
to the extent sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that any products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions and other products cannot be assured 
we also believe that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for all of our products will affect revenues in the future 
we have previously reduced and in the future will likely reduce prices for our products 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions have had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
gross margins our gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from to was due primarily to the acquisition of vutek in which has lower gross margins than our other categories 
gross margins decreased in versus primarily due to the acquisition of vutek starting june of our inkjet printers have a lower gross margin than our controllers and advanced professional print software product lines 
product mix is a significant driver in our gross margins and we cannot predict the impact that product mix will have on future gross margin results 
gross margins on our inkjet products have a lower gross margin than our traditional controller business 
our ink sales represent a continuing revenue stream to existing customers that will increase if our inkjet customers production increases 
ink margins are typically higher than overall inkjet margins 
our inkjet product line is growing as a percentage of revenue which decreases gross margin percentage 
for inkjet revenues were of total revenue as compared to of total revenues in if our product mix changes significantly  our gross margins will fluctuate 
in addition  gross margins can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on our current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors  print heads and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of our product transitions and new products  competition and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  gross margins may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we reduce prices  gross margins for our products could be lower 

table of contents our print controllers are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
if our third party manufacturers cannot obtain the necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience an increase in our product costs 
we purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which we license from adobe systems incorporated 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and increased by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue totaled   and for   and  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in versus was primarily due to a decrease in in process research and development expense ipr d from million in relating to the vutek acquisition to million in relating to the jetrion acquisition 
excluding the impact of ipr d  operating expenses increased by million mainly due to increases in stock based compensation of million  amortization expense of million  vutek full year operating expenses in  and increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses due primarily to higher operating expenses from higher headcount from last year 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel related and facility expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting  depreciation and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase of million in versus was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation of million  higher personnel and other related costs due to higher headcount  and higher spending due to inkjet research and development 
research and development headcount was and as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success and we intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development efforts 
accordingly  we expect that our research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
a reduction in prototype expenses also contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses in from as part of our operational practices  we review all projects on a periodic basis for estimated return on investment 
those projects that do not meet certain criteria may be changed or halted 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel related expenses  costs for trade show related expenses  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  japan and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million increase in expenses in versus primarily related to the acquisition of vutek  which is included in the full year results for and for seven months in vutek sells directly to end user customers which results in a higher level of sales expense compared to our oem customers 
vutek sales and marketing expenses increased by million in from the remaining increases consisted of a increase in stock based compensation expense  from million in to million in sales and marketing headcount was and as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents the million increase in expenses in versus was primarily related to the million in vutek related marketing expenses  offset primarily by million in employee related cost reductions due to the reduction in workforce in the first quarter of  and million in lower tradeshow expenses 
drupa  a leading print industry exposition in europe which occurs every four years in europe  increased trade show expenses in we expect that our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as we continue to actively promote our products  launch new products and services  and continue to build our sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific  and as we grow our software solutions and other new product lines which require greater sales and marketing support from us 
we also expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
approximately of our sales and marketing expenses are incurred from offices outside the united states 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  bad debt  professional fees and other costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million increase in versus principally consists of an increase of stock based compensation of million from million in to million in  and million incurred in for accounting and legal fees relating to our independent investigation into past stock option practices 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in of million as compared to principally consists of increases in overall expenses related to our june acquisition of vutek of million  rent increases of million and increased litigation related fees 
real estate related charges in  we incurred expenses of million related to an million fair market adjustment on our building at velocity way and a million write off of capitalized lease and development costs related to our building and land at our foster city headquarters 
the fair market value adjustment was required as part of a valuation completed in as part of our amended financing arrangement entered into in september for that building 
under the original lease of million  we guaranteed the lessor an residual value in the building upon the termination of the original lease 
the valuation provided a value of approximately million for the building  and we paid the lessor million and recorded a one time loss associated with the original lease in september restructuring charges during the first quarter of we incurred severance costs of approximately million related to a headcount reduction of employees 
amortization of identified intangibles amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million or of revenue in versus or of revenue in the increase of million in versus is primarily due to the inclusion of amortization of vutek intangible assets for a full year in versus seven months in we acquired vutek on june  
table of contents acquired in process research and development at the time of acquisition of each of jetrion and vutek  we expensed acquired in process research and development of million for jetrion in and million for vutek in interest and other income  net interest and other income interest income was million in and increased by from million in interest and other income increased million in versus both yearly increases reflect rising interest rates and higher invested balances 
we had realized losses on our marketable securities of million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense is recognized ratably over the life of our debentures at a rate of per annum when we amortize debt issuance costs related to the convertible debentures 
interest expense including debt amortization totaled million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and million in gain on sale of product line during the second quarter of we sold our inventory and intangible assets related to our mwa line of products 
gross proceeds from the sale were million and we recognized a gain of million 
in  we recognized approximately million from the sale of our unimobile product line  consisting of a customer base  research and development and sales employees  and intangible assets 
income taxes in  we recorded a tax provision of million on a pre tax operating income of million  compared to a tax provision of million recorded in on pre tax operating loss of million and a tax benefit of million recorded in on pre tax operating income of million 
in each of these years  we benefited from research and development credits and benefits derived from the extra territorial income exclusion 
in and  our taxes also decreased due to lower taxes on foreign income 
our taxes increased in and due to non deductible stock compensation charges  and in and due to in process research and development write offs related to the vutek acquisition in and the ads acquisition in as a result of discrete tax adjustments  our taxes in were reduced by million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for state income tax purposes and million due to a reassessment of tax contingency reserves related to the filing of foreign income tax returns  and were increased by million due to the migration of the non north american and chipset product lines to our european headquarters and million related to sales of the mwa assets 
as a result of discrete tax adjustments  our taxes for were reduced by million due to a reassessment of tax contingency reserves related to the filing of us and foreign income tax returns and million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for state income tax purposes 
in the second quarter of  pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  we made the decision to repatriate million of earnings  which had previously been permanently invested outside the united states  and we recorded a tax charge associated with repatriating these earnings of million in the second quarter 
of this million tax charge  million related to earnings accumulated prior to and was recorded in the second quarter of the remaining tax charge of million related to foreign earnings and was reflected in the effective tax rate beginning in the second quarter 
in the fourth quarter  we repatriated million of earnings the million decided upon in q plus an additional million to the us  which resulted in an additional tax charge of million in the fourth quarter 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service for the federal income tax returns filed for the years through as a result of the settlement  the third quarter s tax benefit in was increased by the reassessment of tax contingency reserves resulting in a favorable adjustment of million 
this favorable adjustment was related to the profitability of foreign operations in through and foreign sales corporation and research and development credit benefits 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition and contingencies 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are believed to be our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory and litigation accruals  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  valuation analyses for intangible assets and goodwill  business combinations  and the determination of functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions  and inkjet printers and ink  software and royalties 
we also receive services and support revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support and training and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab and  when applicable  emerging issues task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  for the sale of controllers  printers  and ink 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use either a purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
delivery for hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  we also sell products and services in which the terms included in sales arrangements result in different timing for revenue recognition 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we may not request collateral 
table of contents from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and if applicable  sab and eitf to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and to the software license portion of the agreements using the residual method 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of our professional services based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe of fair value for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
any upfront setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory and litigation accruals 
to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
to do so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to measure the need for inventory reserves 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and the acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  we accrue for estimated legal expenses  including potential regulatory fines when the likelihood of the incurrence of the related costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs 
until both of these conditions are met  the related legal expenses are recorded as incurred 
the material assumptions we use to estimate the amount of legal expenses include the monthly legal expense incurred by our external attorneys on the particular case being evaluated  communication between our external attorneys and us on the expected duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses during that time  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  
table of contents the deductible amounts under the insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
the outcome of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted  and if the outcome is different than expected  our income could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively 
we have from time to time set up allowances or accruals for uncertainties related to revenues and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or accruals on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of stock options  issuances under our employee stock purchase plan  and stock awards 
we also are required to apply a forfeiture rate to reflect what we believe will be our final expense related to stock based compensation 
the amounts to be recorded as stock based compensation expense expected in the future are subject to change if our assumptions for the variables used in determining the fair value of the instruments and the forfeiture rates are revised 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best and compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code section m 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
valuation analyses of intangible assets and goodwill 
in we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
we completed our annual review in the third quarter of  based upon june  balances  with no impairment of goodwill indicated as a result of the review 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets and goodwill totaled million as of december  no adjustments to the lives of the other intangible assets have been made since the adoption of sfas business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of intangible assets acquired 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or other actual results 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs of vacating duplicate facilities 
these costs are based upon estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
we estimate the future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  we primarily quote and bill our international customers in united states dollars 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed below  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiaries  efi kk  and electronics for imaging japan yk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency and our german subsidiary  electronics for imaging gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  when the transactions are not denominated in the functional currency  are included within the statement of operations or  if the transactions are denominated in the functional currency  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 

table of contents under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in stockholders equity 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands as restated as restated cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements to consolidated financial statements 
overview cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase is primarily due to cash generated by operations of million and cash received from employees for purchases of common stock under our espp and through exercise of employee stock options totaling million offset by the acquisition of treasury shares of million and the october purchase of jetrion for million in cash 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and of million  million and million  respectively  was primarily the result of net income loss adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  acquired in process research and development  deferred income taxes  stock compensation and changes in various assets and liabilities such as accounts payable  accounts receivable and other current assets 
our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable 
dsos were days  
table of contents days  and days at december   and respectively 
we calculate accounts receivable dso by dividing the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in quarterly mix of business between our direct and oem customers  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our accounts receivable dso trended upward in reflecting the longer invoice terms offered with our inkjet and apps products  which represented a higher portion of our sales in those years 
dso may trend upwards in future quarters as a greater portion of our revenues will come from direct sales of printers and software which traditionally carry longer terms 
our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
in  the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased our cash flows by approximately million compared to a decrease in cash flows in of million 
in  the change in income taxes payable increased our cash flows by million compared to a decrease in cash flows in of million 
our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the cause of the decrease in working capital of approximately million is principally related to our acquisition of jetrion of million and the classification of million in convertible debt obligations as short term liabilities 
these reductions in working capital were offset in part by cash provided from operations 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue  or the effect on our business from the competitive environment in which we operate 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
investing activities a summary of our investing activities at december   and follows 
the detail of these line items can be seen in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
investing activity in thousands purchases of short term investments proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments net purchases of restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments transfers of investments between restricted and available for sale net purchases of restricted investments purchases  net of proceeds from sales  of property and equipment proceeds from sale of product line  businesses acquired  net of cash received   purchases of other investments net cash used for provided by investing activities  
table of contents acquisitions below is a summary of our acquisitions for the last three fiscal years jetrion on october   we purchased jetrion llc for approximately million in cash 
jetrion sells its industrial inkjet printers and inks to label printing companies 
vutek on june   we acquired vutek for million  net of cash received of million 
vutek s super wide digital inkjet printers and solvent and uv inks allows us to offer print shops a diversified product portfolio and the ability to better integrate our products 
ads technology on february   we purchased ads for million  net of cash received of million 
we purchased ads technology to enhance our software offerings to the copier dealer channels 
in the second quarter of  we sold wma formerly named ads technology for million 
we may buy or invest in complementary companies  products and technologies within the print industry 
our available cash and equity may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 
property and equipment our net equipment purchases totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our property and equipment additions have been funded from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to invest or expand business sites 
investments we made net purchases of marketable securities in of million 
in  we received net proceeds from our marketable securities of million  reflecting the liquidation of marketable securities for the purchase of vutek 
in  we received net proceeds of million resulting from the liquidation of marketable securities to fund the collateral accounts for our synthetic leases 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in corporate bonds and u 
s 
government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted investments we have restricted investments classified as non current assets in connection with the synthetic leases for our foster city offices 
we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts which fully collateralized our synthetic lease 
we now have million in collateral accounted for as restricted investments 
for further information on these transactions  see the discussion at off balance sheet financing 
financing activities historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we 
table of contents received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the lower proceeds in are reflective of our lower stock price during that period 
if our stock price rises  more employees options are in the money  and the employees are more likely to exercise their options  generating cash proceeds to the company 
if our stock price decreases  more of our employees options are out of the money or under water  and therefore  the employees will be unlikely to exercise options  which results in no cash received by us 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
under fas r we are required to expense the fair market value of stock based compensation 
we have decided to change and will continue to assess the term  number and types of equity awards we issue 
this may result in less cash received from issuance of equity awards in the future 
the primary use of funds for financing activities in and was the use of million and million  respectively  of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
no shares were repurchased during see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our programs to repurchase our common stock 
the synthetic lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under fin  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantees have no material value as of december  and therefore have not recorded any liability 
other commitments our inventory consists primarily of inkjet products and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors and asics for our controller line of products  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products and inkjet printheads  frames and other components related to our manufacturer of inkjet printers 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of controllers  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventory we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
should our volumes increase materially on our inkjet printers  our purchases of inkjet printheads  frames and other components will also increase correspondingly 
we may be required to compensate our sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the accrued liability 
legal proceedings in addition to the matters discussed under item  legal proceedings  we are involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of our business 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  except for million in senior convertible debentures which is reported as current 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations interest payments on senior convertible debentures senior convertible debentures total lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated and are based on current market interest rates libor 
see off balance sheet financing 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our senior convertible debentures 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on efi and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet financing all amounts in this section are presented in thousands  except for per share amounts 
synthetic lease arrangements we are a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
these leases provide a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
both leases expire in july we may  at our option  purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities million for the lease and million for the lease 
we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the buildings equal to of their funding of the respective leases 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we 
table of contents were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of december  we are liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the buildings if we default on our covenants 
we obtained limited and conditional waivers from the lessor regarding any event of default that should occur solely as a result of an event of default on other indebtedness caused by our failure to comply with covenants relating to the filing and delivery of our periodic reports 
we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees under the leases and believe that there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
the funds pledged under the leases million for the lease and million for the lease at december  for a total of million are in libor based interest bearing accounts and are restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
in conjunction with the leases  we leased the land on which the buildings are located to the lessor of the buildings 
these separate ground leases are for approximately years 
we are treated as the owner of these buildings for federal income tax purposes 
effective july   we applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin r for variable interest entities vies 
we have evaluated our synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
we have determined that the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  because we are not the primary beneficiary under fin r we are not required to consolidate the vies in our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all amounts in this section are presented in thousands  except for per share amounts 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term investments of various holdings  types and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps over a twelve month time horizon 

table of contents this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points convertible debentures the fair value of our convertible debt was estimated to be million as of december  and the carrying value was million 
the fair market value of our convertible senior debentures was estimated based upon quoted market prices 
derivatives we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in germany  india  japan and the netherlands 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities  typically us treasury and agencies securities  corporate debt instruments  and asset backed instruments 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
