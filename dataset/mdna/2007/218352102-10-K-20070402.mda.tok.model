all statements contained in this form k other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
when used in this report or elsewhere by management from time to time  the words believe  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  expect  and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations  but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking 
forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to  statements about the progress of our research  development and clinical programs and timing of the introduction of corlux and future product candidates  estimates of the dates by which we expect to report results of our clinical trials  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for corlux or other future product candidates  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our estimates for future performance  and our estimates regarding our capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
our current capital is not sufficient to fund operations beyond early we need additional capital in order to continue operations and capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors

accordingly  you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of medications for the treatment of severe psychiatric and metabolic diseases 
since our inception in may  we have been developing our lead product  corlux  targeted for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic major depression  or pmd  under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
the united states food and drug administration  or fda  has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd 
between august and march we announced the top line results of our initial three phase trials in which corlux was evaluated for treating the psychotic features of pmd 
we reported the initial results of study  the last of the three phase trials  in march these results indicated that this study did not achieve statistical significance with respect to the primary endpoint 
however  there was a statistically significant correlation between plasma levels and clinical outcome achieved during treatment 
patients whose plasma levels rose above a predetermined threshold statistically separated from both 
table of contents those patients whose plasma levels were below the threshold and those patients who received placebo 
in particular  those patients in study who achieved a predetermined level of nanograms of corlux per milliliter of plasma separated from the placebo group with statistical significance 
conversely  at substantially lower plasma levels  there was no distinguishable response rate between patients who received corlux and those receiving placebo 
this study confirms a similar finding in study that at higher plasma levels the drug candidate is able to demonstrate desired clinical effects 
further  the incidence of serious adverse events did not differ between placebo and any of the three corlux dose groups 
we believe that the confirmation of a drug concentration threshold for efficacy  as well as other observations from study and the company s other two recently completed phase clinical trials  will serve as a strong basis for our next phase study  which is planned to commence later in the protocol for this trial will incorporate the learnings from the three completed trials that address the sensitivity of the model and decrease the random variability observed in the results of the psychometric instruments used to measure efficacy 
we intend to meet with the fda to discuss and seek input concerning the design of this trial 
in this trial we expect to use a dose level of mg once per day for seven days because  as expected  at successively higher dosages  more patients achieved the predetermined plasma threshold concentration 
in study  of the patients achieved a drug plasma level sufficient for a strong clinical response at that dose 
in our initial review of a summary of the safety data  we have seen no difference between any of the dose levels used in study we believe that this change in dose as well as other modifications to the protocol should allow us to definitively demonstrate the efficacy of corlux in the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of pmd 
in addition  we initiated two additional phase clinical trials to evaluate the safety and tolerability of retreatment with corlux 
the first  study  commenced in the united states in december the second  study  commenced in europe in august we terminated the patient activity related to these clinical trials in the fourth quarter of in october  we announced that we had signed an agreement with eli lilly and company  or lilly  in which lilly agreed to support our proof of concept clinical study evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of olanzapine 
this study in healthy male volunteers was initiated during the first quarter of we have relocated this study to a new site in india and have made minor changes in the protocol 
we began screening patients in march and to report the results of this study at the end of the second quarter of our activities to date have included product development  designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials  regulatory affairs  and intellectual property prosecution and expansion 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred stock and the public sale of common stock rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaborative payments payable to us  except for the revenue under the agreement with lilly discussed above 
we are in the development stage and have incurred significant losses since our inception because we had not generated any revenue through  and do not expect to generate significant revenue for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for corlux  discovery research  non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as general and administrative 
table of contents expenses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our corlux clinical development program  apply for regulatory approvals  expand development of gr ii antagonists for new indications  acquire and develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our corlux clinical trials  uncertainties associated with securing financing  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to finance our operations and develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our lead product 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market 
in order to maintain that listing  we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements 
on november  we received notice from the nasdaq stock market staff that we were not in compliance with two listing requirements 
first  the nasdaq stock market staff notified us that the closing bid price of our common stock had not met the per share minimum requirement for consecutive business days 
the closing price of our common stock on the global market had been less than for a period of at least business days starting september  on january   nasdaq stock market staff informed us that we were no longer out of compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement and that nasdaq considered the matter closed 
since regaining compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock has remained above in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
second  the nasdaq stock market staff notified us that we were not in compliance with the requirement that stockholders equity for companies listed on the nasdaq global market should be no less than  our third quarter report showed that our stockholder s equity on september  was  on december   we submitted a plan to regain compliance with the minimum equity requirement which was rejected by the nasdaq stock market staff on december  we appealed the staff s determination of non compliance on december  and were granted a hearing before the nasdaq listings qualifications panel on february   we had submitted a revised plan of compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement prior to the hearing and discussed this revised plan at the hearing 
results of operations collaboration revenue collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreement with lilly discussed above 
under the agreement  lilly will supply olanzapine and pay for the budgeted costs of the study 
under the agreement  we are required to perform specified development activities and the fee paid to us by lilly is based on the costs associated with the conduct of that trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue is recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the agreement 
the cost of providing these research services approximates the revenue recognized 
if the costs of the study exceed budgeted amounts  lilly may not pay for the excess 
as of december   the costs incurred have not exceeded the budgeted amounts 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately  of revenue under this agreement 
no such revenue was recorded during as the study did not commence until early total revenues from this collaboration are expected to be approximately  over the course of this study 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as the costs of discovery research  pre clinical studies  clinical trial preparations  enrolment and monitoring expenses  regulatory costs and the costs of manufacturing development 

table of contents research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for which had increased from million for the increase in expenses between years reflect clinical trial cost increases of approximately million for as compared to  which had increased million from primarily related to clinical trial expenses for pmd 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in of approximately  and a decrease in of approximately million in expenses for our discovery research program due to the successful conclusion of a program focusing on the discovery of new chemical entities that will be available for future development 
during as compared to  the costs of our clinical program also reflected a decrease of approximately  from the conclusion of our study in mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in and an increase of approximately  related to the commencement of the olanzapine induced weight gain mitigation clinical trial in collaboration with lilly 
in addition  during  as compared to there were decreases in pre clinical studies and manufacturing development of approximately  and  respectively  decreases in travel  consulting and other expenses of  and increases in staffing expenses of approximately  the increases in staffing expenses were primarily due to higher non cash stock based compensation expense 
in addition  during as compared to  decreases in production and testing of clinical supplies and manufacturing development of approximately  and stock based compensation of approximately  were offset by increases in pre clinical studies  clinical consulting and infrastructure costs of approximately   and  respectively 
research and development expenses discussed above included stock based compensation charges related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and in addition  during the years ended december   and upon the termination of employees or the change in status of employees who worked in a development function to consultants  we recorded reversals of approximately   and  respectively  of previously reported stock based compensation expense  which represents the difference between the expense recorded and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the service of these individuals as employees 
see the discussion below under the caption stock based compensation for options to employees impact of adopting sfas r regarding the impact of adoption in january below is a summary of our research and development expenses by major project year ended december  project in thousands corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd corlux for other clinical programs drug discovery research stock based compensation total research and development expense we expect that research and development expenditures will decrease during because substantially all patient activities related to clinical trials for pmd that we have been conducting were completed during and remaining reporting activities should be completed by the second quarter of research and development expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on the availability of additional funds to finance clinical development plans based on our experience from prior trials 
see also  the liquidity and capital resources section in this form k 

table of contents many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and other professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   which had decreased from million for the year ended december  the increase in as compared to was primarily due to increases in professional fees of approximately  and increases in staffing costs of approximately  the increases in staffing expenses were primarily due to higher non cash stock based compensation expense 
during as compared to decreases in stock based compensation of approximately  and legal expenses of  were partially offset by increases in professional fees  insurance  market research and staffing of approximately    and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately million   and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and see discussion below under the caption stock based compensation for options to employees impact of adopting sfas r regarding the impact of adoption in january the decrease between and was due to the decelerating scale of expense recognition under the graded vesting method 
the amount of general and administrative expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on our assessment of the staff necessary to support our continued clinical development activities and the availability of additional funds 
see also  the liquidity and capital resources section in this form k 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of investment management fees  decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  from million for the same period in after having increased from approximately  for the year ended december  the change during as compared to was principally attributable to decreased earnings due to lower average balance of invested funds that were partially offset by higher yields on the investment portfolios during the period as compared to the period 
the increase during as compared to was principally attributable to higher balance with the investment of funds from the initial public offering of our common stock  or ipo  in april and to higher yields on the investment portfolios 
other expense 
other expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in and  for other expense during and included state tax and interest expense on capitalized leases entered into during the second quarter of the expense in also included interest expense on our convertible note payable to the institute for the study of aging 
the note was converted into common stock in june liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities to fund our operations 
in december  we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds of this financing were approximately million after deducting expenses 

table of contents at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments balances of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of net losses associated with our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop our administrative infrastructure 
on march   we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a private placement 
the net proceeds were approximately million after deducting issuance costs 
we have sufficient funds to maintain our current operations through the completion and reporting of results of the proof of concept weight gain mitigation study  expected in june  to prepare for the next phase trial and to continue development of our new chemical entities 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we will not be able to continue operations beyond early we will have to perform additional efficacy trials prior to submission of an nda for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd 
we will need to raise additional funds to complete the development of corlux for the treatment of pmd and other indications  to prepare for its commercialization and to conduct other research activities 
the additional funds will be used to fund increases in our research and development and general and administrative activities in and subsequent years 
we believe that funds should be available for these purposes assuming investors acceptance of our business plan going forward  which includes a fourth phase clinical trial in pmd  opportunities that may be created by the results of the proof of concept trial evaluating mitigation of atypical antipsychotic induced weight gain and the development of our new chemical entities 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate  that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own  or we may be required to discontinue operations 
contractual obligations the following table presents our estimates of obligations under contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years in thousands research and development studies operating lease capital leases minimum royalty payments per year total  per year amounts reflected for research and development studies exclude amounts included in accounts payable and accrued clinical costs reflected on the balance sheet as of december  during  and  we executed a number of agreements to conduct clinical trials and pre clinical studies for further development of our lead product  corlux  targeted for the treatment of the psychotic features of pmd 
the agreements provide for termination by us upon forty five days written notice or less 
the exact amounts and timing of these obligations are dependent on the pace of activities of the various trials and studies 
as of december   substantially all patient activities had been completed and remaining reporting activities are expected to be completed by the second quarter of certain of the agreements discussed in footnotes above relate to trials to be conducted in europe 
the contractual agreements for these trials are denominated in euros  which are converted to us dollars at the time of invoicing 
the remaining obligations under these agreements are subject to fluctuation based on the changes in the currency rates 
see discussion under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents in november  we signed an agreement with a contract research organization to assist in the conduct of a weight gain mitigation study to be performed in the total commitment remaining outstanding as of december  is approximately  the costs of this study will be reimbursed to us under a collaboration agreement with lilly that was signed in october our operating lease commitment relates to the lease of our office facility 
during  we entered into capital leases for the acquisition of certain pieces of office furniture and equipment 
under our cancelable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses from stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 
we also have other contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with pmd and early dementia  including early alzheimer s disease  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering the licensed product and  upon fda approval of the licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 
in addition  our agreement with scinopharm taiwan that provides for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for corlux includes a minimum purchase commitment of  per year following the commercial launch of corlux 
this agreement may be terminated by us at any time without penalty 
on november   we signed an agreement with produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas for the manufacture of mifepristone  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in corlux  for its development and commercial needs for an initial period of five years 
the agreement provides for an automatic extension for one additional year unless either party gives twelve month s prior notice that it does not want the extension 
there is no guaranteed minimum purchase commitment under this agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty 
net operating loss carryforwards at december  we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  in federal research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as approximately million of california net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  in california research and development tax credit carryforwards  available to offset any future taxable income we may generate 
the federal and california net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance as the realization of such assets is uncertain 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized in any particular year if certain changes in our ownership occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreement signed in october with lilly under which lilly supplies olanzapine and pays for the budgeted costs of the study 
we are required to perform development activities as specified in this agreement and the fee that we are paid for these services is based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue is recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the agreement 
the cost of providing these research services approximates the revenue recognized 
if the costs of the study exceed budgeted amounts  lilly may not pay for the excess 

table of contents accruals of research and development costs 
we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts and service providers 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation for options 
stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors we adopted statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas r  as of january  under the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payment arrangements with employees granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees and directors prior to the effective date of statement r that remain non vested on the effective date 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based compensation for options granted to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and had adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
because we had used the minimum value method for options granted prior to the ipo in for sfas pro forma disclosure requirements  we continue to account for the portion of these pre ipo grants that were non vested as of january  under the provisions of apb and related interpretations  with pro forma disclosures under sfas following is a brief synopsis of the implications of adoption of this statement on our accounting practices and the estimates and judgments that are considered in determining fair value in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors the grant date fair value for all new grants issued after january  is being amortized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options 
the expected term used in determining the fair value for options is based on the simple method prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  in staff accounting bulletin  and considers the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual life of the options 
there has been no adjustment made to the expected term to adjust for employees expected exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior because we have a limited employee base and do not have sufficient historical information to determine such an adjustment 
the expected volatility of our common stock used in determining the fair value of option grants is based on a weighted average combination of the volatility of our own stock price and that of a group of peer companies since we do not have sufficient historical data from which to base an appropriate volatility assumption 
since we have a limited employee base  at this time we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations 

table of contents when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded under the straight line method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 
non employees stock based compensation related to option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  based on the fair value of the options  which approximates the period over which the related services are rendered  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the sfas disclosures for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value related to unvested non employee options is remeasured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq stock market 
stock based compensation for options to employees impact of adopting sfas r the following table indicates the impact of implementation of sfas r for employee options on our statement of operations 
year ended december  operating expense category research and development general and administrative total amounts in thousands expense under provisions of apb incremental expense expense under provisions of sfas r as of december   the company had the following amounts of unrecognized compensation expense for employee options outstanding as of that date

sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we have adopted sab as of january   as required 
we do not believe that implementation of sab will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas and sfas are both effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas and sfas on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions  and the short term and long term investments consist of corporate debt securities and us government obligations 
to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  we have limited the maturities of our investments to less than two years with an average maturity not to exceed one year 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december  currency risk in  we signed a master agreement with a cro to assist us in the conduct of clinical trials in europe 
the costs of these trials are denominated in euros  which the vendor converts into us dollars for invoicing as costs are incurred  generally on a monthly basis 
thus  we may bear some currency rate exposure for the costs of these trials 
as of december   we had executed amendments to this agreement that included euro denominated commitments of approximately million euros 
in march  we signed an additional amendment to our agreement with this cro to add five european sites to our us based phase trials 
the preparatory work for this effort had begun in late under a letter of intent with the cro 
the total 
table of contents commitment under this amendment is approximately  euros  approximately  based on the conversion rate at the time of signing  of which approximately   euros had been committed previously under the letter of intent 
these trials were originally expected to be conducted through the third quarter of in late october  we notified the cro of our intent to terminate study  the retreatment study 
as of december   all three euro denominated trials have completed all patient activities and remaining reporting activities should be completed by the second quarter of approximately  euros of the contractual commitments had not been expended or accrued as of december   which is equivalent to approximately  using the exchange rate as of that date 
a increase or decrease in the currency rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro would have an impact of approximately  on the unexpended cost of these trials based on the original commitments 
the timing of payments for these trials will depend upon various factors including the timing of final reporting of trial results and the final payments of pass through costs  such as grants to investigators and laboratory services 
the master agreement with this cro provides for termination by us with forty five days notice
