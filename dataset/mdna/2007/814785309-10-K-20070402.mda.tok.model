the purchase consideration was  significant accounting policies the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
please also refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
the company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting  asset liability duration matching  sound actuarial practices  adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
cemetery and mortuary operations pre need sales of funeral services and caskets  including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need funeral services and caskets are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas no 

under sfas  recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenues related to the pre need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of sfas described above 
pre need sales of cemetery merchandise primarily markers and vaults revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery services primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed 
prearranged funeral and pre need cemetery customer obtaining costs costs incurred related to obtaining new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas no 

obtaining costs  which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business  are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed 
revenues and costs for at need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists  the services are performed  collection is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is realized in accordance with sfas no 
the majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as due from sale of loans  and are shown on the basis of the amount of fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
the company is required to exercise judgment to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  and amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
cost of insurance acquired cost of insurance acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for cost of insurance acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of receivables due on mortgage loans sold to investors  cemetery and mortuary operations  mortgage loan operations and other receivables 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of the cemetery and mortuary receivables is the overall economy 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have significant policy initiation fees front end load  which are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
the company  through its mortuary and cemetery operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
mortgage loan loss reserve the company accrues an estimate of future losses on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first year of duration and to repurchase loans in default within the first year 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and best estimate of future liabilities 
deferred compensation the company has deferred compensation agreements with several of its current and past executive officers 
the deferred compensation is payable upon retirement or death of these individuals either in annual installments ten years or lump sum settlement  if approved by the board of directors 
the company has accrued the present value of these benefits based upon their future retirement dates and other factors  on its consolidated financial statements 
depreciation depreciation is calculated principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or remaining lease terms 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain casualty insurance  workers compensation and health benefit programs 
self insurance reserves are maintained relative to these programs 
the level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverages 
when estimating the self insurance liabilities and related reserves  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries 
management reviews its assumptions with its independent third party administrators and actuaries to evaluate whether the self insurance reserves are adequate 
if actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs and exceed these estimates  additional reserves may be required 
the estimation process contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date

risks the following is a description of the most significant risks facing the company and how it mitigates those risks legal regulatory risk the risk that changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the company operates will create additional expenses and or risks not anticipated by the company in developing and pricing its products 
that is  regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits  new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the company s mortgage sales 
also  the company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery mortuary business 
the company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations  thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction  and also by employing underwriting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks 
credit risk the risk that issuers of securities owned by the company  mortgagors of mortgage loans on real estate and obligors on construction loans  will default or that other parties  including reinsurers and holders of cemetery mortuary contracts which owe the company money  will not pay 
the company minimizes these risks by adhering to a conservative investment strategy  by maintaining sound reinsurance and credit and collection policies and by providing for any amounts deemed uncollectible 
interest rate risk the risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the company s investments or impair the ability of the company to market its mortgage and cemetery mortuary products 
this change in rates may cause certain interest sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation 
the company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non conformance with certain policy provisions  by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser  and or by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities 
to the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature  the company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale 
mortality morbidity risk the risk that the company s actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality morbidity experience may cause the company s products to be underpriced  may cause the company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated and other potentially adverse consequences to the business 
the company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices  asset liability duration matching  and sound actuarial practices 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the estimates susceptible to significant change are those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and claims  those used in determining valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  construction loans and other receivables  and those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre need sales 
although some variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are adequate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums  contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business  from interest and dividends on invested assets  and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments 
the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing  however  to date  that has not been necessary 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and the warehousing of mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries 
bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to  as of december  compared to  as of december  this represents of the total investments in and generally  all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
under this rating system  there are six categories used for rating bonds 
at december   or  and at december   or  of the company s total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six which are considered non investment grade 
if market conditions were to cause interest rates to change  the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately  could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique bps bps bps bps change in market value in thousands     the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities  including high yield securities  in its portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets  liabilities  disintermediation  and business risk 
at december  and  the life subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria 
the company s total capitalization of stockholders equity and bank debt and notes payable was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization was and as of december  and  respectively 
lapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period 
the company s lapse rate for life insurance in was  as compared to a rate of in on december   the company completed the acquisition of sslic holding company formerly consolidare enterprises  inc  a florida corporation pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  which the company entered into on april   with sslic holding company and certain shareholders of sslic holding company for the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of sslic holding company 
prior to completion of the acquisition  sslic holding company owned of the outstanding shares of common stock of southern security life 
the company also acquired all of the outstanding shares of stock of insuradyne corp  a florida corporation insuradyne 
as consideration for the purchase of the shares of sslic holding company  the company paid to the stockholders of consolidare at closing an aggregate of  in order to pay the purchase consideration  the company obtained  from bank financing  with the balance of  obtained from funds then currently held by the company 
in addition to the purchase consideration  the company caused southern security life to pay  on the closing date   to george pihakis  the president and chief executive officer of southern security life prior to closing  as a lump sum settlement of the executive compensation agreement between southern security life and mr 
pihakis 
in connection with the acquiring of sslic holding company  the company entered into an administrative services agreement dated december  with southern security life 
under the terms of the agreement  the company agreed to provide southern security life with certain defined administrative and financial services  including accounting services  financial reports and statements  actuarial  policyholder services  underwriting  data processing  legal  building management  marketing advisory services and investment services 
in consideration for the services to be provided by the company  southern security life will pay the company an administrative services fee of  per month  or  on an annual basis  which may be increased  beginning on january   to reflect increases in the consumer price index over the index amount as of january  however  such fee is to be reduced to zero for so long as the capital and surplus of southern security life is less than or equal to  unless southern security life and the company otherwise agree in writing and such agreement is approved by the florida department of insurance 
the company has not made any increases in the amount of the administrative services fee to reflect increases in the consumer price index 
the administrative services agreement remained in effect for an initial term expiring on december  the term of the agreement was automatically extended for additional one year terms expiring december   and the agreement is automatically extended for additional one year terms unless either the company or southern security life delivers a written notice on or before september of any year stating to the other a desire not to extend the term of the agreement 
on december   all of the remaining insurance business of southern security life was transferred to security national life by a reinsurance agreement  except for the capital and surplus required to be maintained under florida law and  as a result  security national life assumed full responsibility for southern security life s obligations under the administrative services agreement 
the obligations assumed by security national life include payment of the monthly administrative services fee to the company
