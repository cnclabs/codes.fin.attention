item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations of our management that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture  sell and support advanced semiconductor capital equipment and process technologies for the global semiconductor industry and related markets 
we offer both front end of line and back end of line systems and process technologies used in a variety of segments of the semiconductor market using critical thin film formation technologies  including ald  pvd  etch  cvd and thermal processing systems 
our customer base is geographically diverse and includes both integrated device manufacturers and foundry based manufacturers 
we have a broad installed base  with approximately  systems in active operation  for which we are providing ongoing parts and services worldwide 
we sell our systems globally primarily through a direct sales force and in some instances through local independent sales representatives 
for the fiscal year ended september   two customers  inotera memories inc and nan ya technology corp  accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and approximately of our net sales in fiscal were attributable to our top customers 
for the fiscal year ended september   two customers  winbond electronics corp 
and inotera memories inc  accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and approximately of our net sales in fiscal were attributable to our top customers 
for the fiscal year ended september   three customers  inotera memories  inc  infineon technologies ag and winbond electronics corp  accounted for  and of our net sales  respectively  and approximately of our net sales in fiscal were attributable to our top customers 
our largest customers may vary from year to year depending upon  among other things  the customer s annual budget for capital expenditures  plans for new fabrication facilities and expansions and new system introductions by us 
we expect to continue to receive a substantial portion of our net sales from a small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
aviza technology  inc was incorporated on december  to facilitate the merger transaction of our subsidiaries  aviza  inc and trikon technologies  inc aviza  inc 
was incorporated on september  by affiliates of vantagepoint venture partners  which we refer to collectively as vantagepoint  as thermal acquisition corporation  a delaware corporation  for the purpose of acquiring the business of the thermal division of asml holding  nv  a netherlands corporation  which division of asml is referred to in this discussion as the predecessor 
on october   thermal acquisition corporation acquired the business of the predecessor and changed its name to aviza technology  inc  which name was subsequently changed to aviza  inc 
in connection with the merger transaction with trikon 
on december   we completed the merger transaction with trikon  and our common stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol avza 
we accounted for the merger transaction as a purchase of trikon  using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result of the merger transaction  our results of operations include trikon s results of operations for all periods after december  the financial condition  results of operations and changes in cash flows for all periods prior to december  presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report represent the activities of aviza  inc we are often required to develop systems in advance of our customers demand for those systems  and we undertake significant system development efforts in advance of any of our customers expressly indicating demand for our systems 
our system development efforts typically span six months to two years 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of other semiconductor equipment companies and other complementary technologies that we believe will enable us to expand our system offerings in the ic fabrication equipment market 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements acquisition of trikon technologies  inc in connection with our acquisition of trikon  we allocated the purchase price associated with the acquisition of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the valuations of these intangible assets required us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the critical estimates we used in allocating the purchase price included future expected cash flows from customer contracts  distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies  as well as assumptions about the periods of time the systems would continue to be used in our portfolio of systems 
our estimates of fair value at the time they were made were based upon assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 or eitf these accounting standards require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria for items and above is based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the amounts charged for the systems delivered and the collectability of those amounts 
we often undertake significant system development efforts in advance of any of our customers expressly indicating demand for our systems 
as a result of the length of our sales cycles  our net sales for any period are generally weighted toward systems that we introduced for sale in prior years 
for purposes of revenue recognition  we classify our systems into two categories  proven technology and new technology 
proven technology systems are those systems with respect to which we have a history of successful installations within a reasonable time frame of delivery and the costs to complete installation do not vary materially from one instance to another 
new technology systems are those systems with respect to which we cannot demonstrate that we can meet the provisions of customer acceptance at the time of shipment 
we typically sell equipment and installation services as a bundled arrangement 
upon shipment of proven technology  we record revenue upon shipment at the lesser of i the residual amount after deducting the fair value of installation services from the contractual value or ii the non contingent amount 
the remaining contractual revenue is recorded upon successful installation of the system 
cost of the equipment relating to proven technology is recorded upon shipment 
to the extent a loss is calculated on shipment due to the foregoing deferral of revenue  a portion of the cost is also deferred to reflect zero gross profit at the time of shipment 
the residual revenue  deferred costs and installation costs are recorded upon successful installation of the system 
revenue and cost of equipment relating to new technology is deferred until installation and acceptance at the customer s premises is completed 
the result of these accounting policies is that for new technology  our recognition of both revenue and cost of goods sold is delayed until customer acceptance  at which time both revenue and cost of goods sold are recognized in full in determining our gross margin 
however  for proven technology  our cost of goods sold may be recognized in full upon shipment  but recognition of a portion of our revenue is delayed until successful installation of the system 
this can result in diminished gross margins at the time of shipment 
revenue from services is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from prepaid service contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue from spare parts is recorded upon shipment 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of our customers and past transaction history 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
in addition  we require collateral from certain of our customers in the form of letters of credit 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
however  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our customers  especially one or more of our most significant customers  could make it more difficult for us to assess creditworthiness  which could result in a financial loss 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of our inventory at the end of each quarter based on assumptions about customer demand and market conditions 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specifically identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our systems and technological obsolescence of our systems 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  we may be required to write down additional inventory 
warranty we accrue for the estimated cost of the warranty on our systems as cost of goods sold  which includes the cost of the labor and parts necessary to repair systems during the warranty period 
the amounts recorded in the warranty accrual are estimated based on actual historical expenses incurred and on estimated probable future expenses related to our current sales 
the warranty service is generally incurred ratably over the warranty period 
our systems typically have warranty periods ranging from one to three years 
our actual warranty costs in the future may vary from our historical warranty costs  which could result in adjustments to our warranty reserves in future periods 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our current income tax provision benefit and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and any ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation effective october   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas we adopted the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas r 
under this method  sfas r was applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  such as unvested stock options  that are outstanding as of the date of adoption will be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards on the date of adoption was based on the grant date fair value as calculated pursuant to the original provisions of sfas  as adjusted for estimated forfeitures for those awards granted after june   the date of our initial filing of our form s registration statement relating to our merger transaction with trikon  and based on the intrinsic values as previously recorded under apb opinion no 
for awards granted prior to that date 
the fair value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate expected stock price volatility based on historical volatility within a representative peer group 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical employee turnover rates 
we believe that because of our limited history and the changes caused by the merger with trikon  the contractual life of our options should be determined by using the safe harbor positions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payments  or sab the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield with similar contractual life 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  stock based compensation consisted of the amounts by which the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying the stock options exceeded the exercise price at the date of grant or other measurement date  if applicable 
in determining the fair value of our common stock at the dates of grants of stock awards  we were unable to rely on a public trading market for our common stock 
therefore  we relied on recent common stock issuances to unrelated third parties or independent third party valuations of our common stock 
we obtained independent third party valuations of our common stock as of december  and june  the exercise prices of the stock options that we granted prior to the filing of our registration statement on form s filed in connection with our merger transaction with trikon were greater than the fair market value of our common stock on the respective dates of grant as determined by these independent third party valuations 
accordingly  we did not record any stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
results of operations in thousands the financial information reported in the table below is for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  which included weeks  the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  which included weeks  and the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  which included weeks 
fiscal net sales cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense net total other expense net income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss net sales fiscal in thousands net sales    net sales for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to the following the integration of our pvd  etch and cvd systems  which we collectively refer to as pec systems  into our suite of systems and our customer base 
because our merger with trikon occurred on december   fiscal included only ten months of net sales by our trikon subsidiary 
net sales attributable to these systems during fiscal increased by million over fiscal unit shipments of pec systems increased by approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  increased penetration of these systems into the asia pacific market contributed significantly to the growth in system sales 
service and spare parts related to pec systems increased by approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase in net sales related to increased sales of our deposition and thermal processing systems 
unit shipments of our deposition and thermal processing systems increased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales recognized upon shipment increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the increase in shipments  lower average revenue deferrals on our rvp plus systems and sales recognized on our celsior fxp ald system shipments 
the lower average revenue deferrals on the rvp plus systems are primarily the result of more favorable payment terms negotiated with our customers 
the change in payment terms in most instances reduces the amount of contingent revenue that we are required to defer upon system shipment 
service and spare parts sales increased by approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to increased demand in the asia pacific region and field option upgrade sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the change in status of our rvp plus and ald pantheon systems from new technology to proven technology in the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in our recognition of million of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal that we previously deferred 
lower unit sales of our rvp plus thermal systems in fiscal  due to the timing of re orders from some of our larger customers  also contributed to the decrease in sales 
sales of pec systems and incremental service acquired through our merger transaction with trikon together with sales of the rvp thermal system introduced in fiscal partially offset these decreases 
during fiscal  our celsior fxp ald system became proven technology 
during fiscal  our deep silicon etch chamber  or dsi chamber  became proven technology 
international sales accounted for  and of net sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that net sales generated outside the united states will continue to account for the majority of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of purchased material  labor and overhead to manufacture equipment or spare parts and the cost of service and factory and field support to customers for warranty  installation and paid service calls 
in addition  the cost of outsourcing the assembly or manufacturing of subsystems to third parties is included in cost of goods sold 
gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal dollars in thousands gross profit    gross margin the increase in gross margin of during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of improved product mix between pec and thermal processing systems  improved gross margin on net sales of our systems recorded both at shipment and upon acceptance and reductions in manufacturing related costs 
these improvements were partially offset by increased net service costs 
the changes in gross margin are summarized as follows the percentage of net sales attributable to the higher gross margin celsior fxp ald and pec systems increased by and  to and of total net sales  respectively 
these product mix improvements were partially offset by lower service revenues as a percentage of total net sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin recognized on shipment of our rvp plus systems increased by due to lower manufacturing costs  which more than offset lower average selling prices 
the celsior fxp ald systems shipped in fiscal achieved significantly higher gross margin than its predecessor  the ald pantheon system  and the lower margin celsior product introduction systems we shipped in fiscal gross margin recognized on our pec systems  which we acquired in our merger with trikon in december  increased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal this was primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory that we acquired in the merger 
gross margin recognized on acceptance increased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to lower costs deferred at shipment on the rvp plus system  lower manufacturing costs and increased gross margin related to pec system acceptance 
improved purchasing processes and lower inventory reserve adjustments related to our newport  wales  uk subsidiary contributed to gross margin improvement 
higher unabsorbed service related costs offset a portion of our gross margin improvement 
expansion of our service capabilities related to shipment growth  particularly in the asia pacific region  required a buildup of our service infrastructure in that region 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal over fiscal was primarily a result of changes in the mix of the systems that we sold 
during fiscal  over of our net sales were attributable to sales of our lower margin rvp plus thermal systems 
during fiscal  the percentage of our net sales attributable to rvp plus systems declined to 
in addition  our introduction of our higher margin ald celsior and rvp systems during fiscal contributed to the increase in our gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal gross margins on the pec systems that we acquired in our merger transaction with trikon were also significantly higher than those for the systems we sold in fiscal service revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal  which also contributed to the increase in our gross margin 
reconfiguration of certain of our systems reduced manufacturing costs  resulting in increased gross margin for those particular systems 
increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs  related primarily to additions through our merger transaction with trikon  were partially offset by warranty savings due to lower than expected warranty costs and reduced warranty terms 
research and development research and development expense consists of employment costs attributable to employees  consultants and contractors who primarily spend their time on system design  engineering and process development  materials and supplies used in system prototyping  including wafers  chemicals and process gases  depreciation and amortization expense allocable to research and development activities and facilities  direct charges for repairs to research equipment and laboratories  costs of outside services for facilities  and process engineering support and wafer analytical services 
we also include in research and development expenses associated with the preparation  filing and prosecution of patents and other intellectual property 
fiscal dollars in thousands research and development    percent of net sales research and development expense for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the following increased costs related to ongoing research and development of pec systems  which we acquired in our merger with trikon in december  totaling million 
approximately million of this increase was related to prototype supplies supporting next generation product development  as well as further enhancement of existing technologies 
fiscal included increases in pec related research and development required to support additional growth experienced subsequent to our acquisition of trikon in december  which has occurred gradually and consistently since the acquisition 
in addition  fiscal only included research and development expense we incurred subsequent to our merger with trikon in december increased salaries and benefits  stock based compensation expense and development lab related costs  including facilities  supplies  chemicals and gases  and depreciation  partially offset by lower patent related legal costs and outside services  made up the majority of the million increase in expense related to our ongoing ald and thermal batch processing research and development efforts 
the increase in research and development expense of million  or  in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to million in costs of ongoing research and development for the pec systems that we acquired in our merger with trikon 
this increase was partially offset by the effect of a million material write off during fiscal related to the redesign of our rvp system 
higher payroll and benefits  depreciation and stock based compensation expense combined with lower consulting costs make up the majority of the remaining difference 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists of employment costs attributable to employees  consultants and contractors who primarily spend their time on sales  marketing and order administration and corporate administrative services  occupancy costs attributable to employees performing these functions  sales commissions  promotional marketing expenses  and legal and accounting expenses 
fiscal dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the following increased salaries and employee benefits of approximately million due to higher headcount 
in addition  stock based compensation expense increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal commission expenses increased by approximately million due to increased sales volume and a greater level of net sales being supported by third party sales representatives in the asia pacific region 
increased legal and accounting fees of approximately million related primarily to litigation costs 
increased costs related to ongoing infrastructure buildup in the asia pacific region of approximately million 
increased outside services costs of approximately million primarily related to the implementation of oracle i 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense of million in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of increased in house and third party representative sales commissions  primarily in china  increased stock based compensation costs related to the adoption of sfas r  increased legal  audit and related costs and increases in costs related to infrastructure buildup in foreign subsidiaries partially offset by lower bad debt provision adjustments during fiscal in addition  the expenses related to the selling  general and administrative activities of our trikon subsidiary were incremental costs during fiscal over fiscal in process research and development fiscal dollars in thousands in process research and development in process research and development costs incurred during fiscal were the result of our merger transaction with trikon in december and represent the write off of technology that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the merger transaction 
interest expense fiscal dollars in thousands interest expense    percent of net sales our interest expense for fiscal  and consisted primarily of interest paid on our revolving line of credit  another line of credit secured by a mortgage on our land and buildings  amortization of debt issuance costs on our revolving line of credit and amortization of the fair value of the warrants issued to vantagepoint  in consideration for its agreement to guarantee a portion of our revolving line of credit 
in addition  dividends that accrued on our mandatorily redeemable series b and b preferred stock were charged to interest expense between march and april  at which time all outstanding shares of our series b and b preferred stock were converted to common stock 
in april  we entered into a new credit facility with a syndicate of banks to refinance our existing revolving line of credit and mortgage line of credit 
our new credit facility includes a revolving line of credit  an equipment term loan and a commercial real estate loan 
aggregate borrowings under our new revolving line of credit  equipment term loan and commercial real estate loan were million at september  aggregate borrowings under our prior revolving line of credit and mortgage line of credit were million and million at september  and september   respectively 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the following lower interest rates on our new credit facility as compared to our prior lines of credit average interest rate as compared to on the revolving line and on the mortgage line of credit during fiscal 
lower debt issuance and warrant amortization costs million recorded in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal 
no dividends on our mandatorily redeemable series b and b preferred stock were recorded during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal lower average borrowings on our credit facility in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the following the average interest rate on our revolving line of credit and mortgage line of credit increased from and in fiscal to and in fiscal higher amortization of debt issuance costs and the fair value of warrants issued in relation to the revolving line of credit facility in fiscal million as compared to fiscal million 
during fiscal  we accrued million of dividends on our mandatorily redeemable series b and b preferred stock as compared to million in fiscal higher average borrowings on our credit facility in fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes because we have incurred significant operating losses  we have not recorded any material federal or state income taxes 
we recorded income taxes relating to certain profitable international subsidiaries of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  one of the subsidiaries we acquired in connection with the merger with trikon generated sufficient taxable income to recognize a portion of the net deferred tax assets we acquired in the merger related to net operating loss carryforwards 
our management has previously been unable to assert that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities recorded in relation to the write up of inventory and intangibles to fair value at december   the date of the consummation of the merger transaction 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets had been previously offset by a full valuation allowance 
in the absence of goodwill  under generally accepted accounting principles  the tax benefit derived from reversal of this valuation allowance must be applied first to reduce non current intangible assets related to the merger transaction  and second to reduce income tax expense 
we recognized approximately  of the valuation allowance attributed to net deferred tax assets relating to the net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the merger transaction during fiscal and the intangible assets acquired in the merger transaction have been reduced accordingly 
the remaining net deferred tax assets continue to be offset by a full valuation allowance at september  liquidity and capital resources at september   our cash and cash equivalents were million as compared to million at september  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the following proceeds from our public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
cash received from this offering  net of direct offering costs  was million 
cash provided by operations of million primarily related to reduction in inventories and income adjusted for non cash reconciling items  which more than offset an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable 
million of cash used in our acquisition of plant and equipment related primarily to our development and demonstration laboratories 
a net reduction of borrowings of million 
during april  we entered into a new credit facility with a syndicate of banks to refinance our existing line of credit and mortgage line of credit 
our new credit facility includes a two year revolving line of credit  an equipment term loan and a four year commercial real estate term loan 
we may borrow up to million under our new credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the london inter bank offering rate  or libor  plus at september  
the credit agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants 
loan commitment fees and other direct expenses totaling  incurred to secure the facility  will be amortized over the lives of the respective loans 
maximum borrowings under the revolving line of credit are million and are secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit were million at september  maximum borrowings under the equipment term loan are million and are secured by a lien on our equipment 
our equipment term loan has a three year amortization period with monthly payments of principal and accrued interest 
outstanding borrowings under the equipment term loan were million at september  as principal is paid down under the equipment portion of the facility  additional borrowing availability will be created under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
maximum borrowings under the commercial real estate term loan are million or of the appraised value of the real estate  whichever is lower  and are secured by a deed of trust on our scotts valley facility 
monthly payments of principal and accrued interest will be based on a year amortization period of the loan principal 
outstanding borrowings under the commercial real estate term loan were million at september  as principal is paid down under the commercial real estate portion of the facility  additional borrowing availability will be created under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
our japanese subsidiary has a revolving line of credit for million japanese yen approximately million at the exchange rate on september  under which there were no borrowings at september  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at per annum 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash balances and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  we may choose to raise additional capital from the sale of debt or equity securities or from other sources in order to support our operations and expansion plans 
we may not be able to obtain any additional capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million 
net income during the fiscal year ended september  of approximately million  which together with non cash expense adjustments primarily depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and net operating loss utilization aggregating million  provided cash from operating activities to offset cash used to fund changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net changes in operating assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended september  used approximately million of cash 
cash used to fund increases in accounts receivable and reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were million  million and million  respectively 
these uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated through reductions in inventory  decreases in prepaid and other assets and increases in warranty liability of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted primarily of cash used to fund net losses of million  which was offset in part by non cash expenses and expense adjustments depreciation  amortization  bad debt  common stock warrants  mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends  stock based compensation and losses on disposal of equipment aggregating million 
net changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal provided million in cash 
this increase in cash was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in prepaid and other assets of million  increases in accounts payable of million and accrued liabilities of million  which were partially offset by an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in warranty liabilities of million 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million 
investing activities during fiscal consisted of purchasing equipment primarily used in our development and demonstration laboratories 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted of million of cash acquired in our merger transaction with trikon and million in proceeds from the sale of equipment  offset by the direct merger costs of million and million used to purchase equipment primarily for use in our development and demonstration laboratories 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million 
net proceeds from our public offering of  shares of our common stock and exercise of stock options provided million in cash 
a reduction in our aggregate borrowings of approximately million and million of debt issuance cost incurred partially offset proceeds from the issuance of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted of proceeds from the issuance of  shares of our common stock in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of million  which was partially offset by payments of million on short term borrowings assumed in our merger transaction with trikon 
in addition  we made million in net payments on our revolving line of credit and mortgage line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k promulgated by the securities and exchange commission 
contractual obligations as of september   our cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt obligations  lease commitments and other contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years greater than five years in thousands bank loan revolving line of credit   equipment note payable    mortgage note payable   other notes payable operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations vendor commitments inventory   other    vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  non inventory supplies and other service related commitments 
assuming the interest rates that were in place on september  on the above obligations and commitments were to remain fixed over the next five years  interest expense is estimated to be as follows fiscal year interest expense in millions recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas  which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas requires that changes in accounting principle be retrospectively applied 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas r  however  allowed for a modified prospective approach of adoption 
the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements

 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance in derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin no 
requires that tax positions previously held which no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met 
use of a valuation allowance as per sfas  is no longer an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this interpretation on our consolidated financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
during the quarter ended september   the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which defines fair value as a market based measurement  creates a gaap framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
while this statement does not impose any new fair value measurements  it does apply  with certain exceptions  to other pronouncements that either require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value as a market based measurement between market participants and not as an entity specific measurement 
fair value is either the price received when selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date 
sfas creates a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the input that should be used in evaluating the assumptions used in pricing techniques used to measure fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
during the quarter ended september   the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab  which provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab calls for the quantification of errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach based on the effects of such errors on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures
