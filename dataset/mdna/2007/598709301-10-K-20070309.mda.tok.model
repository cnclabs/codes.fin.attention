item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary company overview milacron is a leading global provider of equipment  supplies  services and complete end to end solutions to the plastics processing industries 
we are also a leading global supplier of premium industrial fluids to the metalworking industries 
first incorporated in and headquartered in cincinnati  ohio  we employ about  people and operate major manufacturing facilities in north america  europe and asia  while maintaining sales and services offices in over one hundred countries around the world 
milacron s top priority is to support our customers with the most advanced technology and the most comprehensive  reliable service in our industry 
we operate in four business segments 
the first three  machinery technologies north america  machinery technologies europe and mold technologies  serve the plastics processing industries 
our fourth segment  industrial fluids  serves the metalworking sector 
both of our machinery technologies segments provide leading edge capital equipment  related tooling and replacement parts for the three most common methods of processing plastics injection molding  blow molding and extrusion 
our mold technologies segment supplies mold bases  mold components  hot runner systems and numerous other components for injection molding  as well as mro maintenance  repair and operating supplies for all plastics processing operations 
our industrial fluids segment develops and sells premium fluids for metalworking applications such as machining  grinding  forming and process cleaning 
in all our businesses  we focus on leading edge technology with superior aftermarket service and support 
we entered the plastics machinery business with the introduction of our first line of injection molding machines in the late s 
by the mid s  we had become the number one us producer of plastics machinery 

table of contents our major customers are producers of automobiles  packaging  building materials  consumer goods  electrical products  appliances and housewares  industrial components and machinery  and medical devices 
milacron pioneered the development and introduction of synthetic water based industrial fluids in the late s 
our largest customer for fluids is the automotive industry  followed by makers of industrial components and machinery  aircraft  appliances and housewares  and energy extraction 
plastics markets background and recent history since the end of world war ii  plastics and plastic composites have increasingly replaced traditional materials such as metal  wood  glass and paper throughout manufacturing 
since  global consumption of plastics resins has grown at a compounded annual rate of  compared to for steel and for aluminum sources basf ag  association of plastics manufacturers in europe  international iron steel institute  us geological survey 
plastic part production  like industrial production in general  has historically shown sustained growth 
in every year from to  plastic part production in the us increased over the prior year  averaging compounded annual growth source us federal reserve board 
growth in plastics consumption and production has generally created increasing demand for our plastics machinery and related supplies 
between and  our sales of plastics equipment and supplies in north america grew at compounded annually excluding acquisitions including acquisitions 
in the s  milacron  like many other us companies  benefited from a strong  growing economy 
our plastics technologies sales were approaching billion with good profitability 
at the end of the decade  however  the us manufacturing sector fell into its most severe and prolonged downturn since the s 
from june to june  for example  us industrial production  a key indicator of demand for our products  declined source us federal reserve board 
the plastics processing portion of the manufacturing sector was very severely impacted 
as production slowed  capacity utilization rates of us plastics processors dropped from the previous peaks in excess of to record lows around source us federal reserve board  and shipments of injection molding machines in north america fell from a billion month moving total in to under million by the end of it stayed at very low levels through  experiencing only a partial recovery in source the society of plastics industry 
during this deep recession in north america  with european markets stagnant  demand for many of our plastics machinery lines declined by or more  and our total global plastics technologies sales fell 
despite a series of responsive actions  including a number of plant closings  headcount reductions and other measures  severely depressed sales volumes led to consolidated losses from continuing operations in through in  the manufacturing sector of the north american economy began to show some signs of recovery 
in the plastics sector  part production and us capacity utilization were increasing gradually 
in mid  however  the industry was hit by a steep  unexpected jump in oil prices  resulting in rapid rises in material and resin costs 
many of our plastics processing customers were negatively impacted  and despite continued high capacity utilization rates  we saw a slowdown in plastics machinery orders that persisted throughout industrial fluids recent history during the severe manufacturing recession of  overall demand for our metalworking fluids declined only by  as our largest customer group  automakers  maintained high levels of production both in north america and worldwide 
profitability in the fluids business  although impacted  held up fairly well throughout this period  with operating earnings in the range of to of sales 
in and  sales of our metalworking fluids grew modestly  but profitability in this segment declined due to significant increases in product liability insurance and related expenses  as well as higher material costs and pension expense 
in  having successfully implemented price increases to compensate for higher costs  we were able to grow our fluid sales and profitability 

table of contents consolidated results sales and new orders in were up slightly compared to  reflecting modest growth in north america and continued strong growth in asia and other emerging markets 
our net loss for the year was million  which included million in restructuring charges and million in refinancing costs  in both cases  with no tax benefit 
this compared to a net loss in of million  which included million in after tax restructuring charges 
opportunities and challenges as we enter  it appears that energy and various other material prices have receded and capacity utilization rates by us plastics processors  although lower than their recent peak in mid  remain at a level that has historically precipitated capital spending 
this bodes well for a renewed recovery in our north american machinery businesses 
additionally  we will continue to develop new and better products and services  especially in the aftermarket sectors of our businesses 
we will also strengthen our performance and customer focus in our home markets of north america and western europe  while expanding our presence outside the united states  canada and western europe 
overall for  we are projecting global sales growth of to and improved profitability which should be helped by higher volume and the benefits from the restructuring measures taken in presence outside the us since  we have significantly expanded our presence outside the us and become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of our consolidated sales europe  canada and mexico  asia  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of our sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro was stronger in relation to the us dollar than in as a result  milacron experienced favorable currency translation effects on new orders and sales of approximately million each 
the effect on earnings was not material 
during  the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately which caused the majority of an million favorable foreign currency translation adjustment to consolidated shareholders deficit 
if the euro should weaken against the dollar in future periods  we could experience a negative effect in translating our european new orders  sales and earnings when compared to historical results 
significant accounting policies and judgments the consolidated financial statements discussed herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are included therein 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies  estimates and judgmental matters that we believe are significant to our reported financial position and results of operations 
additional accounting policies are described in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned summary of significant accounting policies  presented in item of this form k which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
we regularly review our estimates and judgments and the assumptions regarding future events and economic conditions that serve as their basis 
while we believe that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable in the circumstances  the recorded amounts could vary under different conditions or assumptions 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   we had significant deferred tax assets related to us and us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and to charges that have been deducted for financial reporting purposes but which are not yet deductible for income tax purposes 
these charges include the write down of goodwill and a charge to equity related to minimum pension funding 
at december   we have provided valuation allowances against all net deferred tax assets except million in the us that are offset by qualified tax planning strategies and million of non us assets to be realized through future income expectations and tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances serve to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to amounts reasonably expected to be realized in the future 
the 
table of contents establishment of valuation allowances and their subsequent adjustment requires a significant amount of judgment because expectations as to the realization of deferred tax assets particularly those assets related to net operating loss carryforwards are generally contingent on the generation of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the future and the availability of qualified tax planning strategies 
tax planning strategies represent prudent and feasible actions that management would take to create taxable income to keep a tax attribute from expiring during the carryforward period 
determinations of the amounts related to tax planning strategies assume hypothetical transactions  some of which involve the disposal of substantial business assets  and certain variables which are judgmental and subjective 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider our short term and long range internal operating plans  which are based on the current economic conditions in the markets and countries in which we operate  and the effect of potential economic changes on our various operations 
at december   we had non us net operating loss carryforwards principally in the netherlands  germany and italy totaling million and related deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances totaling million had been provided with respect to these assets 
we believe that it is more likely than not that portions of the net operating loss carryforwards in these jurisdictions will be utilized 
however  there is currently insufficient positive evidence in some non us jurisdictions primarily germany  italy and belgium to conclude that no valuation allowances are required 
at december   we had a us federal net operating loss carryforward of million  which will expire between and deferred tax assets related to this loss carryforward  as well as to our federal tax credit carryforward million and additional state and local loss carryforwards million  totaled million 
additional deferred tax assets totaling approximately million had also been provided for book deductions not currently deductible for tax purposes  including the writedown of goodwill  postretirement health care benefit costs and accrued pension liabilities 
the deductions for financial reporting purposes are expected to be realized for income tax purposes in future periods  at which time they will have the effect of decreasing taxable income or increasing the net operating loss carryforward 
the latter will have the effect of extending the ultimate expiration of the net operating loss carryforward beyond due to a change in ohio income franchise tax law signed by the governor on june   the corporate income franchise tax is being phased out ratably over the years through as a result of the legislative change  the benefit of our ohio net operating loss carryforward will also be phased out 
the transaction entered into with glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc on june  see liquidity and sources of capital caused an ownership change as defined by the internal revenue code and regulations and will substantially delay the timing of the utilization of certain of the pre change us loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
the company has calculated an annual limitation of approximately million that can be used to offset post change taxable income 
this limitation is for each year and is cumulative for years in which the limitation is not fully utilized 
therefore  the cumulative limitation at the end of amounts to approximately million of available pre change net operating losses with no limitations on deductibility 
the million is composed of million from  million from and million from at december   no valuation allowances had been provided with respect to the us deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not assessment of whether they would be realized 
this decision was based on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies and the expectation of increased industrial production and capital spending in the us plastics industry 
higher sales and order levels in and beyond  combined with the significant reductions in our cost structure that had been achieved in recent years  were expected to result in improved operating results in relation to the losses incurred in and at june   however  we concluded that a recovery in the plastics industry and our return to profitability in the us would be delayed longer than originally expected 
as a result of these delays and the incremental costs of the restructuring initiatives announced in the third quarter of  we expected to incur a cumulative operating loss in the us for the three year period ending december  in such situations  us generally accepted accounting principles include a presumption that expectations of earnings in the future cannot be considered in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
accordingly  a charge to the tax provision of approximately million 
table of contents was recorded in the second quarter of to establish valuation allowances with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets for which future income was previously assumed 
as of december   us deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities totaled million and us valuation allowances totaled million 
we continued to rely on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies to conclude that valuation allowances were not required with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets 
at december   valuation allowances had not been recorded with respect to million of us deferred tax assets based on qualified tax planning strategies of million and tax carrybacks of million 
due to better market information and refined estimates  the million of tax planning strategies at the end of represented a net million decrease from the tax planning strategies at december  for the year  us deferred tax assets decreased by million 
valuation allowances were also decreased by million during this period 
at december   us deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities totaled million and us valuation allowances totaled million 
we continue to rely on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies to conclude that valuation allowances were not required with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets 
at december   valuation allowances had not been recorded with respect to million of us deferred tax assets based on qualified tax planning strategies 
due to market value increases related to the assets included in our tax planning strategies model  the million of tax planning strategies at december  represents a million increase over december  we will continue to reassess our conclusions regarding qualified tax planning strategies and their effect on the amount of valuation allowances that are required on a quarterly basis 
this could result in a further increase or decrease in income tax expense and a corresponding increase or decrease in shareholders equity in the period of the change 
accounts receivable  inventory and warranty reserves our internal accounting policies require that each of our operations maintain appropriate reserves for uncollectible receivables  inventory obsolescence and warranty costs in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
because of the diversity of our customers and product lines  the specific procedures used to calculate these reserves vary by location but in all cases must conform to company guidelines 
reserves are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts are generally established using specific percentages of the gross receivable amounts based on their age as of a particular balance sheet date 
because of the product line and customer diversity noted above  each business unit is required to base the percentages it applies to its aged receivables on its unique history of collection experience 
the percentages used are reviewed for continued reasonableness on a quarterly basis 
the amounts calculated through this process are then adjusted for known credit risks and collection problems 
write offs of accounts receivable for our continuing operations have averaged million during the last three years 
while we believe that our reserves for doubtful accounts are reasonable in the circumstances  adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the financial condition of our major customers could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are generally calculated by applying specific percentages to inventory carrying values based on the level of usage and sales in recent years 
as is the case for allowances for doubtful accounts  each business unit selects the percentages it applies based on its unique history of inventory usage and obsolescence experience and forecasted usage 
the preliminary calculations are then adjusted based on current economic trends  expected product line changes  changes in customer requirements and other factors 
in  our continuing operations recorded new inventory obsolescence reserves totaling million and utilized million of such reserves in connection with the disposal of obsolete inventory 
we believe that our reserves are appropriate in light of our historical results and our assumptions regarding the future 
however  adverse economic changes or changes in customer requirements could necessitate the recording of additional reserves through charges to earnings in the future 
our warranty reserves are of two types normal and extraordinary 
normal warranty reserves are intended to cover routine costs associated with the repair or replacement of products sold in the ordinary course of 
table of contents business during the warranty period 
these reserves are accrued using a percentage of sales approach based on the ratio of actual warranty costs over a representative number of years to sales revenues from products sold with warranties over the same period 
the percentages are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary at least annually 
extraordinary warranty reserves are intended to cover major problems related to a single machine or customer order or to problems related to a large number of machines or other type of product 
these reserves are intended to cover the estimated costs of resolving the problems based on all relevant facts and circumstances 
in recent years  costs related to extraordinary warranty problems have not been significant 
in  our continuing operations accrued warranty reserves totaling million and incurred warranty related costs totaling million 
while we believe that our warranty reserves are adequate in the circumstances  unforeseen problems related to unexpired warranty obligations could result in a requirement for additional reserves in the future 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 using probability weighted cash flows discounted at market interest rates 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever certain indicators of impairment are present 
sfas no 
requires that the first phase of testing goodwill for impairment be based on a business unit s fair value  which is generally best determined through market prices 
due to the absence of market prices for our businesses and as permitted by sfas no 
 we have elected to base our testing on discounted cash flows as discussed above 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we complete in the third quarter of each year 
in this process  each business unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
each business unit s plan is reviewed by corporate management and the entire plan is reviewed with our board of directors 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels  general economic trends and other factors 
the discount rates are obtained from an outside source based on the standard industrial classification codes in which our businesses operate 
these discount rates are then judgmentally adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results  country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the non us countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate and other factors 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industries in which we operate 
in recent years  many of our cash flow forecasts have not been achieved due in large part to the unprecedented length and depth of the recession  particularly in the market for capital equipment in the plastics processing industry 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable in the circumstances  various economic factors could cause the results of our testing to vary significantly 
while we recorded goodwill impairment charges in and  our annual reviews as of october   and did not result in additional charges 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets other than goodwill annually under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these reviews are conducted by comparing the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that are included in our long range internal operating plans to the carrying values of the related assets 
to be conservative  no growth in operating cash flows beyond the third year is currently assumed 
under this methodology  impairment would be deemed to exist if the carrying values exceeded the expected future cash flow amounts 
in  we reviewed the aggregate carrying values of selected groups of our long lived assets 
the assets included in these reviews consisted principally of property  plant and equipment and  where applicable  intangible assets other than goodwill 
based on these reviews  it was determined that the maximum period of time to recover the carrying values of the tested groups of assets through undiscounted cash flows is approximately years and that the weighted 
table of contents average recovery period is approximately of the remaining average lives of the assets 
based on the results of the reviews  no impairment charges were recorded in self insurance reserves through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  milacron assurance ltd 
mal  we are primarily self insured for many types of risks  including general liability  product liability  environmental claims and workers compensation for certain us employees 
mal  which is incorporated in bermuda and is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of that jurisdiction  establishes reserves commensurate with known or estimated exposures under the policies it issues to us 
exposure for general and product liability claims is supplemented by reinsurance coverage in some cases and by excess liability coverage in all policy years 
workers compensation claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial carriers 
at december   mal and the company had reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims under all coverages totaling approximately million and expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties of million 
expected recoveries represent the excess of total reserves for known exposures and incurred but not reported claims over the limits on the policies mal issues to us 
these amounts are classified as assets because unless other payment arrangements are negotiated  we as the insured party expect that we would first pay any indemnity claims and expenses in excess of mal s limits and then pursue reimbursement from the excess carriers 
of the million in reserves at december   million is included in long term accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at that date 
the remaining million is included in accrued and other current liabilities 
the expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties are included in other current assets million and other noncurrent assets million 
mal s reserves are established based on known claims  including those arising from litigation  and our best estimates of the ultimate liabilities thereunder after consideration of excess carriers liabilities and claims against third parties and on estimates of the cost of incurred but not reported claims 
for certain types of exposures  mal and the company utilize actuarially calculated estimates prepared by outside consultants to ensure the adequacy of the reserves 
reserves are reviewed and adjusted at least quarterly based on all evidence available as of the respective balance sheet dates or as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
while the ultimate amount of mal s exposure to claims is dependent on future events that cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that the recorded reserves are appropriate based on current information 
it is possible that our ultimate liability could substantially exceed our recorded reserves as of december   but the amount of any such excess cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
were we to have significant adverse judgments or determine  as cases progress  that significant additional reserves should be recorded  our future operating results  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
the most significant of these plans is the principal defined benefit plan for certain us employees and retirees us plan  which is a funded plan 
one other defined benefit plan in germany is also funded with 
million in assets 
pension expense for the us plan was million for  million in and million in pension expense for is currently expected to be approximately million 
expense for and beyond is dependent on a number of factors  including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension income or expense and the reasons for the rise in costs identified above 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense to be recorded for the funded us plan is the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption 
in and  we used an expected long term rate of return of 
however  we used a rate of return of beginning in and have continued to do so in our projections 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of investments included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in evaluating future returns on equity securities  the existing portfolio is stratified to separately consider  among other things  large and small capitalization investments  as well as 
table of contents international securities 
the change from the rate of return assumption to the lower rate had the effect of increasing the amount of pension expense that would otherwise have been recorded in by approximately 
million 
in determining the amount of pension expense to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in recorded pension expense but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on the long term rate of return assumption 
at december   the market value of the plan s assets was million whereas the calculated value of these assets was million 
the difference between these amounts is not significant because aggregate actual returns on plan assets in recent years have approximated the applicable expected long term rate of return assumptions in use 
however  the losses incurred in and resulted in significant differences 
if significant asset related losses are incurred in  it will have the effect of increasing the amount of pension expense to be recognized in future years beginning in in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
if the combined cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension expense 
between december  and december   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was gradually reduced from to 
the discount rate was then increased to at december  in response to generally higher interest rates and as modeled by our plan s actuary 
however  the combined effects of these changes and the variances in relation to the long term rate of return assumption in and that are discussed above have resulted in cumulative losses in excess of the corridor 
pension expense for the us plan for both and includes approximately million for the amortization of previously unrecognized losses 
expense for amortization of previously unrecognized losses is expected to be between and million in additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent increase in the rate of return on plan assets assumption would have the effect of decreasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable decrease in the rate of return on plan assets would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately million 
conversely  a one quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would have the effect of increasing pension expense by million 
at december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 
which requires that we recognize the underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
for all of our defined benefit plans  adoption of the standard had the effect of increasing current liabilities by million  increasing noncurrent liabilities by million  decreasing other noncurrent assets by million and increasing shareholders deficit by million  in all cases in relation to the amounts that would have otherwise been reported 
the current liability relates to plans that are unfunded and represents projected benefit payments by these plans  funded by the company  for the next twelve months 
the us plan is funded and has assets sufficient to pay projected benefits for the next twelve months and therefore  no current liability has been recorded for this plan

the comparisons of results of operations that follow exclude the grinding wheels business and relate solely to our continuing operations 
pension expense and pension funding for  we recorded pension expense related to the funded defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees and retirees of million compared to million in and million in the increases compared to were due primarily to changes in the plan s discount rate assumptions 
as discussed further below  the higher pension expense has negatively affected margins  selling and administrative expense and earnings 
pension expense for this plan in is expected to decrease to approximately million due to an increase in the discount rate and additional earnings on higher asset levels that will result from the contributions to the plan in under pension law in effect for and and the related funding standards  we were required to make cash contributions to the funded defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees and retirees of approximately million in of this amount  million was contributed in the first three quarters 
in addition  we voluntarily contributed million to the plan in the third quarter  credit for which eliminated contribution requirements for which were previously estimated at million and for the fourth quarter contributions required in and beyond will be based upon the provisions of the pension protection act of  which will be effective on january  funding requirements for are estimated between million and million 
however  for years and beyond  funding requirements cannot be precisely estimated at this time 
compared to new orders and sales consolidated new orders were million in  an increase of million  or approximately  in relation to new orders of million in consolidated sales were million in  an increase of million  or approximately  compared to our north american machinery businesses and our industrial fluids business drove growth in both new orders and sales for which were offset in part by declines in our mold business 
new orders and sales both benefited from million of favorable foreign currency effects 
export orders were million in compared to million in export orders were up in all three plastics machinery businesses 
export sales of injection molding machines increased million  sales of extrusion systems increased million and sales of blow molding systems increased million 
export sales to canada increased million and sales to mexico increased million 
sales of all segments to non us markets were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in products manufactured outside of the us represented of total sales in and of sales in the backlog of unfilled orders was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase relates principally to higher order levels for extrusion and blow molding systems in our north american operations and injection molding machines in europe and asia

million of restructuring costs  the consolidated manufacturing margin was in compared to in in  margins benefited from cost reduction efforts  a full year s effect of pricing actions taken in and stabilized raw material costs offset  in part  by additional inventory writedowns compared to last year 
in  margins were negatively affected by rising raw material costs while selective price increases over the course of the were not always sufficient to overcome the cost increases we experienced 
we expect that further cost reduction measures combined with additional selective price increases will result in improved margins in total selling and administrative expense increased from million in to million in selling expense increased by million compared to  including a million increase related to trade shows and million of additional direct sales costs including dealer commissions and discounts 
selling and administrative expense increased from of sales in to in with 
of the increase related to the higher trade show costs 
interest expense net of interest income was million in compared to million in in  interest expense decreased related to benefits from our interest rate swap and capitalized interest 
the interest rate swap had the effect of decreasing interest expense in by

million 
we capitalized 
million of interest expense in compared to 
million in these benefits were offset in part by higher borrowing volumes partly related to our voluntary pension contribution 
refinancing costs during  we charged to expense million of refinancing cost  related to the termination of our previous asset based lending facility with jpmorgan chase bank  which was entered into on june  the cost was principally the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing fees of the terminated lending agreement

restructuring costs during the last three years  we have initiated numerous restructuring initiatives for the purpose of reducing our cost structure and improving operating efficiency 
these actions and certain other actions that we initiated prior to are described in detail in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned restructuring costs that are presented in item of this form k 
in total  these actions resulted in restructuring costs of million in and million in the net cash costs were million in and 
million in the amount for is net of million from the sale of a manufacturing facility that had previously been idled while the amount for is net of million of proceeds from the sale of two idle facilities in germany and a surplus warehouse in denmark 
certain of the actions initiated in and will be continued and completed in additional actions are also expected to be initiated in 
table of contents the costs and related cash effects of the actions initiated in through as well as certain other actions that were initiated in through are summarized in the table that follows

table of contents the non cash restructuring costs incurred in through consist principally of million of supplemental early retirement benefits that will be paid by our defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees  million to adjust inventories related to discontinued product lines to expected realizable values and million to adjust the carrying values of facilities  production equipment other assets to be disposed of to expected realizable values 
results by segment machinery technologies north america the machinery technologies north america segment had new orders of million and sales of million 
in  new orders were million and sales were million 
sales increased in each of the segment s three main product lines with injection molding machine sales up million or  extrusion systems up million or and blow molding systems up million or  in all cases in relation to increased extrusion system sales were driven by higher exports with sales to canada increasing million and sales to europe increasing million 
operating earnings for the segment were relatively flat with prior year at million as additional earnings related to increased sales volume and lower costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox were offset by the npe show costs 
in  the segment s restructuring costs were million compared to million in in  restructuring costs were primarily associated with a temporary early retirement program 
machinery technologies europe in  the machinery technologies europe segment had new orders of million compared to new orders of million in and had sales of million compared to sales of million in sales growth was driven by higher sales of blow molding systems  up million or compared to last year 
foreign currency translation had an insignificant impact for the year 
the segment s operating results were flat compared to prior year at an operating loss of million  excluding restructuring charges 
due to extremely competitive market conditions  the segment was unable to recover higher material costs from and restructuring charges were million in and were related to reorganization of the german injection molding machinery facility and to the second phase of the previously discussed consolidation of sales offices in europe

however  the potential annual loss on floating rate debt from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have been significant at either of the aforementioned dates 
on july   we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap that effectively converted a portion of our fixed rate interest debt into a floating rate obligation 
the swap was terminated on december  in connection with our entering into a new asset based lending facility

were this non us cash to be repatriated  it could result in withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 
operating activities used million of cash in due principally to a million voluntary contribution to the funded defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees and retirees  partially offset by the liquidation of assets for non qualified retirement plans 
the usage of cash was also due in part to a reduction in liabilities and an increase in inventories that resulted from higher order levels 
operating activities provided million of cash in due principally to reductions in accounts receivable and in certain other current and non current assets 
the benefits of these decreases were partially offset by an increase in inventories that resulted from higher order levels

financing activities provided million of cash in which included million of proceeds from a rights offering  the proceeds of the refinancing transactions of march  and june  including million of short term loans that were ultimately converted to new equity in a non cash transaction and usages of cash of million to repay bank borrowings and million for debt issuance costs 
our current ratio was at december  compared to at december  the total shareholders deficit was million at december   a reduction of million from december  the decrease was due principally to our net loss for  the adoption of a new accounting standard see significant accounting policies and judgments pensions and preferred stock dividends  the combined effects of which were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments and a favorable adjustment to minimum pension liability under a previous accounting standard 
total debt was million at december  compared to million at december  on march   we entered into a definitive agreement whereby glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc purchased million in aggregate principal amount of our new exchangeable debt securities

the rate was retroactively reset on june  to per annum from the date of issuance  payable in cash 
on march   we also reached a separate agreement with credit suisse first boston for a million senior secured credit facility having a term of approximately one year 
this senior secured credit facility consisted of a million revolving a facility and a million term loan b facility 
on march   we used extensions of credit under the revolving a facility and term loan b facility in an aggregate amount of million to repay and terminate our then existing revolving credit facility in addition to replacing or providing credit support for outstanding letters of credit and our then existing receivables purchase program

on june   we also satisfied the conditions to release to us from escrow the proceeds from the offering of million of senior secured notes due and entered into an agreement for a new million asset based revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank as administrative agent and collateral agent 

table of contents on june   we applied the proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes due  together with million in borrowings under our asset based facility and approximately million of cash on hand  to purchase  of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of milacron capital holdings bv s guaranteed bonds due in april at the settlement of a tender offer there for  terminate and repay million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving a facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  which included additional amounts borrowed subsequent to march  we also used million of availability under our asset based facility to replace or provide credit support for the outstanding letters of credit under the revolving a facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  repay the million term loan b facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  and pay transaction expenses 
the borrowings under the jpmorgan asset based facility entered into on june  contained significant covenants and conditions which can be found in our form k for december  and as discussed below was terminated and replaced on december  on december   we entered into a new five year asset based revolving credit facility for which general electric capital corporation acts as administrative agent and a lender 
the new asset based facility replaced our million asset based facility for which jpmorgan chase bank served as administrative and collateral agent  which was terminated by us 
the termination of the previous facility was concurrent with  and contingent upon  the effectiveness of the new facility 
the new facility provides increased liquidity and better terms than the previous facility with up to million of borrowing availability and no financial maintenance covenants as long as we comply with certain minimum availability thresholds  as described below 
in addition to terminating our previous asset based facility  we also terminated our interest rate swap that was entered into on july  the security underlying the new asset based facility is substantially the same as that granted in connection with the previous facility 
the borrowings under the asset based facility are secured by a first priority security interest  subject to permitted liens  in  among other things  us and canadian accounts receivable  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and  in the us  certain related rights under contracts  licenses and other general intangibles  subject to certain exceptions 
the asset based facility is also secured by a second priority security interest on the assets that secure the senior secured notes due on a first priority basis 
the availability of loans under our asset based facility is limited to a borrowing base equal to specified percentages of eligible us and canadian accounts receivable and us inventory as well as permitted overadvances and is subject to other conditions to borrowing and limitations  including an excess availability reserve the minimum required availability of million and other reserve requirements 
the facility has a stated maturity of december  based on the assets included in the borrowing base as of december   including a million over advance facility  but without giving effect to reserves  outstanding borrowings and issuances of letters of credit in all cases  as discussed below  we had approximately million of borrowing availability  subject to the customary ability of the administrative agent for the lenders to reduce rates  impose or change collateral value limitations  establish reserves and declare certain collateral ineligible from time to time in its reasonable credit judgment  any of which could reduce our borrowing availability at any time 
at december   million of the asset based facility was utilized  including borrowings of million and letters of credit of million 
under the terms of the facility  our additional borrowing capacity based on the assets included in the borrowing base at december  was approximately million after taking into account the minimum availability and existing reserve requirements 
the terms of our asset based facility impose a daily cash sweep on cash received in our us bank accounts from collections of our accounts receivable 
this daily cash sweep is automatically applied to pay down any outstanding borrowings under our asset based facility 
the terms of our asset based facility also provide for the administrative agent  at its option and at any time  to impose a daily cash sweep on cash received in our canadian bank accounts from collections of our accounts receivable 
since the cash we receive from collection of receivables 
table of contents is subject to the automatic sweep to repay the borrowings under our asset based facility on a daily basis  we rely on borrowings under our asset based facility as our primary source of cash for use in our north american operations 
our liquidity could be materially affected if we have no additional availability or are unable to satisfy the borrowing conditions  including  among other things  conditions related to the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties and the absence of any unmatured or matured defaults including under financial covenants or any material adverse change in the company s business or financial condition 
our asset based facility contains customary conditions precedent to any borrowings  as well as customary covenants  including  but not limited to  maintenance of unused availability under the borrowing base based on reserves including the excess availability reserve and other reserves established by the administrative agent 
our asset based facility requires us to maintain a million excess availability reserve and contains a limit on annual capital expenditures starting with and a springing financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  to be tested quarterly  in the event that excess availability is less than million 
as of december   after giving effect to the million of then outstanding letters of credit and the million borrowed under the asset based facility  our availability after deducting a total of million of reserves was approximately million 
our continued viability depends on realizing anticipated cost savings and operating improvements on schedule and continued improvement in demand levels in and beyond  the latter of which is largely beyond our control 
unless we realize anticipated cost savings and operating improvements on schedule and volume and pricing levels continue to improve  we may need to fund interest payments on the senior secured notes in part with the proceeds of borrowings under our asset based facility 
however  our ability to borrow under our asset based facility is subject to borrowing base limitations  including the excess availability reserve and other reserves  which may be adjusted from time to time by the administrative agent for the lenders at its discretion  and our satisfaction of certain conditions to borrowing  including  among other things  conditions related to the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties and the absence of any unmatured or matured defaults including under financial covenants or any material adverse change in our business or financial condition 
in particular  our continued ability to borrow under our asset based facility is contingent on our ability to comply with financial covenants and other conditions to borrowing as discussed above 
if we have no additional availability or are otherwise unable to borrow against the facility  our liquidity would be impaired and we would need to pursue the alternative sources of liquidity discussed above to service our debt and pay our expenses 
there is no assurance that we would be able to sell assets  refinance debt or raise equity on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations under our indebtedness  as discussed above 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or draw sufficient amounts under our asset based facility to satisfy our debt obligations and pay our other expenses could cause us to default on our obligations and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borrowings under our asset based facility bear interest  at our option  at either the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined below or the index rate plus the applicable margin as defined below 
the applicable margin  with respect to libor loans is between per annum and per annum and  with respect to index rate loans  between 
per annum and per annum  determined based on a calculation of the trailing average availability levels under our asset based facility 
libor rate means the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market are quoted 
we may elect libor loan interest periods of one  two or three months 
index rate means the higher of the rate of interest publicly quoted from time to time by the wall street journal as the prime rate and the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 
our asset based facility provides that we will pay a monthly unused line fee equal to 
per annum on the average daily unused portion of our credit commitment  as well as customary loan servicing and letter of credit issuance fees 
our asset based facility provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the facility  upon demand by the agent  we will have to pay in the case of revolving credit loans  a rate of interest per annum equal to the rate of interest otherwise in effect assuming the rate in effect is at the maximum applicable margin pursuant to the terms of the facility plus default rate and in the case of other amounts  a rate of interest per annum equal to the default rate applicable to such amount 

table of contents pending the satisfactory resolution of ongoing discussions with the export import bank of the united states ex im bank  we expect to have available as a subfacility the ex im subfacility of the asset based facility the ability to borrow up to million net of applicable reserves against eligible foreign receivables guaranteed by ex im bank
