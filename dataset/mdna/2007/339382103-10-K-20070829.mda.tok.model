item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectability of trade accounts receivable  inventory valuation  depreciable lives  self insurance programs  warranty costs and income taxes 
ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts on a monthly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable fair value due to their short term nature 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience and actual returns and allowances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
a large portion of our finished goods inventory is made to order and many of our raw material parts are interchangeable between products 
historically inventory write downs to market have been in fabric and sourced products purchased for inventory 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses the inventory on hand versus estimated future usage and estimated selling prices and if necessary writes down the obsolete or excess inventory to market 
although  we believe that inventory valuations are reasonable  unexpected changes in sales volume due to economic or competitive conditions may impact inventory valuations 
raw steel  lumber and wood frame parts are valued on the last in  first out lifo method 
other inventories are valued on the first in  first out fifo method 
changes in the market conditions could require a write down of inventory 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets and estimated depreciable or amortizable lives for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows and is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that asset carrying values may not be recoverable or that the estimated depreciable or amortizable lives may have changed 
these evaluations could result in a change in estimated useful lives in future periods 
there were no impairments taken during fiscal  or self insurance programs the company is self insured for health care and most workers compensation up to predetermined amounts above which third party insurance applies 
the company purchases specific stop loss insurance for individual health care claims in excess of  per plan year  with a million individual lifetime maximum 
for workers compensation the company retains the first  per claim and purchases excess coverage up to the statutory limits for amounts in excess of the retention limit 
the company is contingently liable to insurance carriers under its comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability policies  as well as some workers compensation 
losses are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability of claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
the actual claims experience could differ from the estimates made by the company based on product performance 
warranty the company has warranty coverages with respect to the original purchases of our products that range from three months to lifetime 
to estimate the warranty liability  the company completes an analysis of the amount of warranty claims on sold product that may be incurred 
this analysis includes consideration of claim trends from historical levels to current and projected levels  changes in product performance  historical and expected claim lag periods  changes in sales levels and changes in product mix 
the actual warranty expense could differ from the estimates made by the company based on product performance 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the company s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
revenue recognition is upon delivery of product to our customer 
delivery of product to our customer is evidenced through the shipping terms indicating when title and risk of loss is transferred 
our ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales amount is determined 
the delivery of the goods to our customer completes the earnings process 
net sales consist of product sales and related delivery charge revenue  net of adjustments for returns and allowances 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to changes in working capital 
significant working capital changes from june  to june  included increased accounts receivables of million  decreased inventory levels of million and decreased accounts payable of million 
the increase in receivables is related to timing of shipments and related payment terms 
the decrease in inventory is due primarily to timing of inventory purchases to meet our forecasted customer demands 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to the reduction in inventory levels and the timing of payments 
in  there was a large increase in inventory levels of million that significantly impacted cash flows from operations 
the company expects that due to the nature of our operations that there will be significant fluctuations in inventory levels  the related accounts payable  and cash flows from operations due to the following we purchase a significant amount of inventory in large orders from overseas suppliers with significant lead times and depending on the timing of those large orders inventory levels can be significantly impacted  we have various large customers that purchase significant quantities of inventory at a time and the timing of those purchases can significantly impact inventory levels  accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term borrowings 
as discussed below the company believes it has adequate financing arrangements and access to capital to absorb these fluctuations in operating cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the significant change in investing activities is related to the large amount of capital expenditures made in somewhat offset by a sale of land and commercial property 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

the remainder of expenditures was primarily for delivery and manufacturing equipment

the company expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal year the significant fiscal year capital expenditure cash outflows were offset by a significant sale of commercial property resulting in total cash proceeds of million and a sale of vacant land of approximately million 
the commercial property was previously leased to a non related third party and used as retail space 
neither the sale of the commercial property or vacant land is expected to significantly impact future operations 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the significant fluctuations in financing cash flows relates to the borrowings to fund operating cash flow requirements 
cash dividends were million in and in management believes that the company has adequate cash  cash equivalents  and credit arrangements to meet its operating and capital requirements for fiscal in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity and credit resources provide it with the ability to react to opportunities as they arise  the ability to pay quarterly dividends to its shareholders  and ensures that productive capital assets that enhance safety and improve operations are purchased as needed

the purchase price on all open purchase orders was fixed and denominated in us dollars 
financing arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this filing on form k 
outlook consistent with industry wide trends  orders for residential and vehicle markets continued soft throughout the company s fiscal year 
the residential furniture market is very challenging and continues to quickly change 
we are confident in our strategy of offering a blended product mix through multiple independent distribution outlets 
the vehicle seating business is slower than desired at this time  however  we like the mid to longer term demographics and our position as a supplier to the top ten original equipment manufacturers 
the company expects this softness in the residential and vehicle seating markets to continue through the first half of fiscal year the growth in orders for products into commercial applications slowed in the fourth quarter of fiscal even with this moderated growth rate  we continue to believe that our commercial business will continue to be a bright spot in the near term and we will use the growth opportunities in commercial and hospitality markets to continue to grow a base for longer term growth 
the company continues to explore cost control opportunities in all facets of its business 
the company believes it has the necessary inventories and product offerings in place to take advantage of opportunities for expansion of market share in certain markets  such as commercial office and hospitality 
the company anticipates continuing its strategy of providing furniture from a wide selection of domestically manufactured and imported products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
impairment of long lived assets accounting rules require that long lived assets be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have substantial long lived assets  consisting mainly of property  plant and equipment  which based upon such events or changes in circumstances  there could be a write down of all or a portion of these assets and a corresponding reduction in our earnings and net worth 
at june   no impairment of long lived assets has been identified 
foreign currency risk during fiscal  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming no change in the volume or composition of debt 
the company has effectively fixed the interest rates at on approximately million of its long term debt through the use of interest rate swaps  and the above estimated earnings reduction takes these swaps into account 
as of june   the fair value of these swaps is an asset of approximately million and is included in other assets 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant during the past three years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates are important components of costs for the company 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact any or all of these components  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  the company has faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments
