item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed under risk factors in part i  item a above 
business overview we design  develop and market innovative networking products that address the specific needs of small business and home users 
we define small business as a business with fewer than employees 
we are focused on satisfying the ease of use  reliability  performance and affordability requirements of these users 
our product offerings enable users to share internet access  peripherals  files  digital multimedia content and applications among multiple personal computers  or pcs  and other internet enabled devices 
our product line consists of wired and wireless devices that enable ethernet networking  broadband access  and network connectivity 
these products are available in multiple configurations to address the needs of our end users in each geographic region in which our products are sold 
we sell our networking products through multiple sales channels worldwide  including traditional retailers  online retailers  wholesale distributors  dmrs  vars  and broadband service providers 
our retail channel includes traditional retail locations domestically and internationally  such as best buy  circuit city  compusa  costco  fry s electronics  radio shack  staples  argos uk  dixons uk  pc world uk  mediamarkt germany  austria  and fnac france 
online retailers include amazon 
com  newegg 
com and buy 
com 
our dmrs include dell  cdw corporation  insight corporation and pc connection in domestic markets and misco throughout europe 
in addition  we also sell our products through broadband service providers  such as multiple system operators in domestic markets and cable and dsl operators internationally 
some of these retailers and resellers purchase directly from us while most are fulfilled through wholesale distributors around the world 
a substantial portion of our net revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of wholesale distributors  the 
table of contents largest of which are ingram micro inc and tech data corporation 
we expect that these wholesale distributors will continue to contribute a significant percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
we have well developed channels in the united states and europe  middle east and africa  or emea  and are building a strong presence in the asia pacific region 
we derive the majority of our net revenue from international sales 
international sales as a percentage of net revenue grew from in to in sales in emea grew from million in to million in  representing an increase of approximately during that period 
we continue to penetrate new markets such as brazil  eastern europe  india  and the middle east 
our net revenue grew during the year ended december   primarily attributable to higher sales of dsl gateway and powerline products to new and existing service provider customers  especially in europe  as well as continued strength in our rangemax wireless router product line 
the small business and home networking markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect our competition to continue to intensify 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the small business and home markets for networking products include product breadth  size and scope of the sales channel  brand name  timeliness of new product introductions  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  ease of installation  maintenance and use  and customer service and support 
to remain competitive  we believe we must invest significant resources in developing new products  enhancing our current products  expanding our channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
our gross margin improved to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our gross margin improvement was primarily due to decreased marketing costs and improved vendor rebates  offset by increased sales of products carrying lower gross margins to service providers 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million or of net revenue and million or of net revenue for the year ended december  net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in gross profit of million and an increase in interest and other income of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have listed below our critical accounting policies which we believe to have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time the product is shipped provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some of our customers  title passes to the customer upon delivery to the port or country of destination  upon their receipt of the product  or upon the customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  we estimate and defer revenue related to product where title has not transferred 
the revenue continues to be deferred until such time that title passes to the 
table of contents customer 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different if our management made different judgments and estimates 
allowances for product warranties  returns due to stock rotation  price protection  sales incentives and doubtful accounts our standard warranty obligation to our direct customers generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable or is found to be damaged or defective 
at the time revenue is recognized  an estimate of future warranty returns is recorded to reduce revenue in the amount of the expected credit or refund to be provided to the our direct customers 
at the time we record the reduction to revenue related to warranty returns  we include within cost of revenue a write down to reduce the carrying value of such products to net realizable value 
our standard warranty obligation to end users provides for repair or replacement of a defective product for one or more years 
factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the estimated cost associated with fulfilling the warranty obligation to end users is recorded in cost of revenue 
because our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers  in certain cases we have recourse to the contract manufacturer for replacement or credit for the defective products 
we give consideration to amounts recoverable from our contract manufacturers in determining our warranty liability 
our estimated allowances for product warranties can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions or charges to cost of revenue which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to warranty related returns  certain distributors and retailers generally have the right to return product for stock rotation purposes 
every quarter  stock rotation rights are generally limited to of invoiced sales to the distributor or retailer in the prior quarter 
upon shipment of the product  we reduce revenue for an estimate of potential future stock rotation returns related to the current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  channel inventory levels  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  namely stock rotation returns 
our estimated allowances for returns due to stock rotation can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for sales incentives as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
our estimated provisions for sales incentives can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional expenses or additional revenue reductions dependent on the classification of the sales incentive 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessments of our customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expenses 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under non cancelable purchase commitments  including consignment inventory  in comparison to our estimated forecast of product demand for the next nine months to determine what inventory  if any  are not saleable 
our analysis is based on the demand forecast but takes into 
table of contents account market conditions  product development plans  product life expectancy and other factors 
based on this analysis  we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
as demonstrated during prior years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand and we fail to reduce our manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from different treatments for tax versus accounting of certain items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  however  if there were a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not more likely than not 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to tax credits  state taxes  stock compensation and other factors 
our future effective tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income  tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions  changes in tax laws in the united states or internationally  a change which would result in a valuation allowance being required to be recorded  or a federal  state or foreign jurisdiction s view of tax returns which differs materially from what we originally provided 
we assess the probability of adverse outcomes from tax examinations regularly to determine the adequacy of our income tax liability 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be

and net changes in deferred revenue 
sales incentives include advertising  cooperative marketing programs  end caps  instant rebates and mail in rebates 
net revenue compared to net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we continued to experience our seasonal pattern of higher net revenues in the second half of the year 
the increase in revenue was especially attributable to higher sales of dsl gateway and powerline products to new and existing service provider customers  especially in europe 
the majority of these incremental sales specifically included our wireless gateway customized for major service provider british sky broadcasting in the united kingdom  with shipments of wireless gateways and powerline products to other service providers further improving revenue 
sales were further enhanced by the first full year of rangemax wireless router sales to the home market 
we introduced our rangemax family of products  which included performance enhancing multiple in multiple out mimo technology  during  and the market has continued to embrace this key product line throughout the year 
we expect the rangemax family to remain strong in the coming year  and anticipate continuing our recent trend of increased sales of customized wireless gateways to service providers  both domestically and abroad 
we 
table of contents also anticipate new products such as our wireless n routers  skype wi fi phones  and gigabit smart switches to drive revenue in the near future 
sales incentives that are classified as contra revenue grew at a slower rate than overall gross sales  which further contributed to the increased net revenue 
this is primarily due to increased sales to the service provider markets  which typically require less marketing spending 
this favorable net revenue impact was partially offset by an increase in sales returns compared to historical return rates 
for the year ended december  revenue generated in the united states  emea and asia pacific and rest of world was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue over the prior year for each region was  and  respectively 
net revenue compared to net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we continued to experience our seasonal pattern of higher net revenues in the second half of the year 
the increase in revenue was especially attributable to higher sales of wireless lan products to the home market  especially the new rangemax family of products and continued strength in g and super g products  as well as increased gross shipments of our broadband gateways 
these revenue increases were partially offset by increases in allowances for sales incentives associated with increased retail product sales 
we were able to slow down the pace of erosion in our average selling prices on our relatively older products in in part due to our new minimum advertised price policy with our us retailers  as well as a general slowdown in competitive pricing pressures 
end user customer rebates and other sales incentives which are classified as reductions in net revenue increased in  especially in the latter half of when we took advantage of significant strategic joint promotion opportunities with our biggest retail partners both in the us and in europe 
for example  we co marketed our new rangemax family of products with us national retailers using a unified advertising campaign involving ad circulars and new end cap displays 
these increases in spending combined with higher use of end user customer rebates impacted our revenue growth 
for the year ended december  revenue generated in the united states  emea and asia pacific and rest of world was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue over the prior year for each region was  and  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross margin year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data cost of revenue gross margin percentage cost of revenue consists primarily of the following the cost of finished products from our third party contract manufacturers  overhead costs including purchasing  product planning  inventory control  warehousing and distribution logistics  inbound freight  and warranty costs associated with returned goods and write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
we outsource our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution logistics 
we believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin 
our gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including sales returns  changes in net revenues due to changes in average selling prices  sales incentives  and changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in prices paid for components  net 
table of contents of vendor rebates  warranty and overhead costs  inbound freight  conversion costs  and charges for excess or obsolete inventory and transitions from older to newer products 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  our gross margin is impacted by our sales incentives that are recorded as a reduction in revenue which grew at a relatively slower rate than overall net revenue  as most of our revenue increases relate to sales to service providers  which involve significantly lower sales incentive expenses 
additionally  we experienced decreased price protection claims  as well as relatively lower inbound freight during the year  as we were able to shift the mix of inbound shipments from our suppliers from more costly air freight to lower cost sea freight due to better supply chain planning 
furthermore  rebates from vendors were significantly higher in while we do not expect this higher level of rebates to continue in the future  we anticipate lower costs on these products 
these improvements were almost entirely offset by a number of factors 
incremental sales in came primarily from increased sales of products carrying lower gross margins to service providers 
we also experienced increased warranty and sales returns costs  driven primarily by a higher scrap rate of warranty return units and an increase in reserves taken for future returns based on the increase in returns volume during the year 
we also experienced higher costs related to inventory reserves and devaluation 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   an increase of percentage points 
this increase was due primarily to a favorable shift in product mix and our product costs decreasing relatively more quickly than sales prices  offset by an increase in end user customer rebates and other sales incentives  which reduce revenue along with increased inbound freight and conversion costs 
we were able to slow down the pace of erosion in our average selling prices on our relatively older products in in part due to our new minimum advertised price policy with our us retailers  as well as a general slowdown in competitive pricing pressures 
we have also had continued success in obtaining cost reductions and efficiencies from our vendors and manufacturers  and have pursued product redesigns when appropriate to further lower production costs 
these decreasing costs  coupled with the relative slowing in the decrease of average selling prices  boosted margins on our older products  especially our g and super g wireless adapters 
additionally  we have benefited from relatively higher standard margins on newer products  especially from our rangemax family of products 
it is difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products across our markets and within specific countries 
the shift in the mix of actual orders compared to forecasted demand resulted in a higher than normal reliance on more expensive air versus surface freight during the last quarter of as well as higher rework and other costs primarily related to product conversions among country specific packaging 
additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  
table of contents operating expenses research and development expense year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data research and development expense percentage of net revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  payments to suppliers for design services  tooling design costs  safety and regulatory testing  product certification expenditures to qualify our products for sale into specific markets  prototypes and other consulting fees 
research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred 
we have invested in building our research and development organization to enhance our ability to introduce innovative and easy to use products 
we expect to continue to add additional employees in our research and development department 
in the future we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand into new product technologies  enhance the ease of use of our products  and broaden our core competencies 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher salary and related payroll expenses of million resulting from research and development related headcount growth  including  related to retention bonuses for certain employees associated with the acquisition of skipjam 
employee headcount increased by to employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december   in part due to employees obtained from the acquisition of skipjam 
the increase was also attributable to an increase of million in engineering costs 
these costs were incurred to improve the quality of our small business products 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased  to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased salary and payroll related expenses of million resulting from research and development related headcount growth 
employee headcount increased by to employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december  these headcount increases were primarily due to the expansion of our research and development facility in taiwan and expansion of our focus on the broadband service provider market which often requires additional certifications and testing 
additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data sales and marketing expense percentage of net revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  trade shows  corporate communications and other marketing expenses  product marketing expenses  outbound freight costs  personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff and technical support expenses 
we believe that maintaining and building brand awareness is key to both net revenue growth and maintaining our gross margin 
we also believe that maintaining widely available and high quality technical support is key to building and maintaining brand awareness 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future  related to the planned growth of our business 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we note that sales and marketing expenses grew in line with revenue growth 
of this increase  million was due to increased salary and payroll related expenses as a result of sales and marketing related headcount growth and increased commissions earned in emea due to substantial revenue growth 
employee headcount increased from employees as of december  to employees as of december  more specifically  of the incremental employees relate to expansion in emea and asia pacific  which represents our continued geographic expansion and increasing sales staffing in these regions 
for example  we established a technical support center in our ireland office  which accounted for new individuals 
outside service fees related to customer service and technical support also increased by million  in support of higher call volumes related to increased units sold 
we also incurred a million increase in advertising  travel  and promotion expenses related to our expansion of marketing activities into new geographies 
outbound freight increased million  reflecting our higher sales volume 
marketing costs classified as operating expenses remained relatively constant  as the majority of incremental marketing expenses related to rebates and other items classified as contra revenue 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to product promotion  including intensified in store staffing and training programs  advertising  and outside technical support expenses  all in support of increased volume 
in addition  salary and related expenses for additional sales and marketing personnel increased by million as a result of sales and marketing related headcount growth from employees as of december  to employees as of december  we attributed of the incremental employee additions to expansion in emea and asia pacific  where sales and marketing employee headcount grew and  respectively 
the increase was also attributable to additional allocated overhead costs such as facilities and information systems costs amounting to  which reflects sales and marketing s larger relative headcount growth rate and correspondingly higher share of overhead costs 
additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  general and administrative expense year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data general and administrative expense percentage of net revenue general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and accounting  human resources  professional fees  allowance for bad debts  and other corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars related to the general growth of the business  continued international expansion  and increased investments in infrastructure such as a new enterprise resource planning system 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher salary and payroll related expenses of million due to an increase in general and administrative related headcount 
employee headcount increased by to employees as of december  compared to employees as of december  of the incremental additions  personnel were hired into accounting and finance departments in our new ireland office 
we also incurred a million increase in fees for outside professional services  which was in part related to an increase in it consulting costs  tax consulting and general legal expenses 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   as a result of the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fees for professional services aggregating million and a decrease in net allocated overhead such as information systems costs aggregating  offset by an increase in employee related costs of million 
the decrease in fees for professional services resulted from decreases in consulting  outsourced accounting fees and legal fees  and costs associated with initial sarbanes oxley compliance documentation in the increase in employee related costs resulted from an increase in general and administrative related headcount  particularly in the finance area to support an increase in transactional processing due to increased revenue 
employee headcount increased by to employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december  the decrease in net allocated overhead reflects the general and administrative function s slower headcount growth rate relative to other functional areas 
additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  in process research and development during the year ended december   we expensed million for in process research and development related to intangible assets purchased in our acquisition of skipjam 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition 
in process r d is expensed upon an acquisition because technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist 
we acquired only one in process r d project  which is related to the development of a multimedia product that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use 
we incurred costs of approximately  to complete the project  of which approximately  was incurred through december  we completed the project in february litigation reserves during the year ended december   we recorded an allowance of  for the estimated costs of settlement for the zilberman v

no litigation reserves were recorded in the year ended december  interest income and other income expense year ended december  in thousands interest income other income expense  net total interest income and other income expense interest income represents amounts earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income expense  net  primarily represents gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and other miscellaneous expenses 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was a result of an increase in the average interest rate earned 
other income expense  net  increased to income of million for the year ended december   from an expense of million for the year ended december  the income of million was primarily attributable to a net foreign exchange gain experienced in the year ended december  due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro  the great britain pound  and the australian dollar 
the expense of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a net foreign exchange loss experienced due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound and the australian dollar 

table of contents the aggregate of interest income  interest expense  and other expense amounted to net other income of million for the year ended december   compared to net other income of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to an additional million in interest income for the year ended december   from the investment of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance throughout the year 
this was offset in part by an increase in other expense of million consisting primarily of realized and unrealized losses associated with foreign currency denominated transactions due in part to currency volatility during the year as well as our billing in foreign currencies which began in the first quarter of provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased million  resulting in a provision of million for the year ended december   from a provision of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for both periods differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to non deductible stock based compensation  state taxes  other non deductible expenses  and tax credits 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was also impacted by non deductible charges pertaining to in process research and development as a result of the acquisition of skipjam 
provision for income taxes increased million  to a provision of million for the year ended december   from a provision of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately and differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to state taxes  and other non deductible expenses  offset in part by tax credits 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately and differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to non deductible stock based compensation  state taxes  and other non deductible expenses  offset in part by a million tax benefit from exercises of stock options and tax credits 
net income net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in gross profit of million and an increase in interest and other income of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  our short term investments  which represent the investment of funds available for current operations  increased from million as of december  to million as of december  operating activities during the year ended december  generated cash of million primarily due to an increase in net income 
investing activities during the year ended december  used million  which includes the net purchase of short term investments of million  purchases of property and equipment amounting to million  and payments made in connection with our acquisition of skipjam of million 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided million  primarily resulting from the issuance of our common stock upon exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program 
our days sales outstanding decreased from days as of december  to days as of december  our accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  
table of contents inventory increased by million from million at december  to million at december  ending inventory turns decreased  from approximately turns in the quarter ended december   to turns in the quarter ended december  based on our current plans and market conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the forseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our planned levels of revenue  costs and expenses will be achieved 
if our operating results fail to meet our expectations or if we fail to manage our inventory  accounts receivable or other assets  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our product offerings  channels and geographic presence  we may require additional working capital 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable or commercially acceptable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment 
while we expect to fulfill the order backlog within the current year  most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or order cancellation  our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any succeeding period 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle non cancelable lease and purchase commitments as of december  less than more than year years years years total in thousands operating leases purchase obligations we lease office space  cars and equipment under non cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through december rent expense was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the terms of some of the office leases provide for rental payments on a graduated scale 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period  and have accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice to days prior to the expected shipment date and of orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 
at december   we had million in non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers 
as part of our acquisition of skipjam  we agreed to pay up to million in cash contingent on the continued employment of certain former skipjam employees with us 
these payments will be recorded as compensation expense over a two year period 
during the year ended december   we have recorded  of additional compensation expense pursuant to this agreement  and expect to pay up to  over the remaining life of this agreement

we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
we generally have not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
in the second quarter of we began to invoice some of our international customers in foreign currencies including  but not limited to  the euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the australian dollar 
as the customers that are currently invoiced in local currency become a larger percentage of our business  or to the extent we begin to bill additional customers in foreign currencies  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
for those customers in our international markets that we continue to sell to in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and negatively impact our operating results 
certain operating expenses of our foreign operations require payment in the local currencies 
as of december   we had net assets in various local currencies 
a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates would result in an after tax positive or negative impact of million to net income at december
