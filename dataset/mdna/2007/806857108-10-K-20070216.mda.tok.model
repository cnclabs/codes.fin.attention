risk factors of this report 
executive overview world oil markets remained tightly balanced for much of as demand  geopolitical events and inherent production decline continued to pressure the margin of excess production capacity 
the price for wti west texas intermediate reached a record of per barrel in mid july but then began a fall that continued through the end of year as increasing stockpiles indicated adequate supply 
although prices recovered as opec cut production targets from november st  mild weather conditions in the northern hemisphere further exacerbated the balance of supply and demand and prices ended the year around the per barrel mark 
however  at this level there were no signs of reductions in customer activity in any of the major oil producing regions around the world 
natural gas displayed similar characteristics with the price falling considerably in the fourth quarter of as the high quantity in storage in north america appeared more than ample for what had begun as a predominantly mild winter 
by the end of  this demand environment had lead to activity reduction in canada  particularly in areas of shallow natural gas and coalbed methane production 
short term variations in commodity prices inevitably produce varying activity growth rates in the underlying industries when the price variations are sufficiently long lasting 
however  maintaining the production base for both oil and natural gas in the face of accelerating decline rates  poorer quality or more difficult reservoirs and eroding reserve replacement ratios we believe will mean that any moderation in customer activity resulting from price variation will be short lived and self correcting 
while schlumberger remains of the opinion that there is no overall shortage of oil and gas reserves worldwide  we believe the world is realizing that the period of cheap hydrocarbon energy has ended and new and higher sustained levels of investment are necessary to meet demand and guarantee future supplies 
within this context  the performance of the two schlumberger business segments  oilfield services and westerngeco  has been particularly strong 
consolidated revenues in grew by  far exceeding original expectations driven by significant price increases  a rich portfolio of new schlumberger technologies  and by stronger activity in almost all geomarkets 
the same combination led to significant margin growth for both schlumberger business segments with westerngeco growth during the year being particularly impressive as exploration activity resurged 
the last two years have seen a significant shift in the dynamics of access to reserves 
this has been the case in latin america and in russia  and is also the case in the middle east 
in addition  and in a way not seen since the oil shocks  access to reserves has become an issue of national energy security  particularly for the growing economies of asia 
as a result  many national oil companies have begun to expand beyond their geographic borders  and are therefore competing for access to reserves against the international industry 
the same lack of access has driven the international oil companies to smaller  more complex and more remote areas where substantial investment is required 
the period from to reflected a lack of exploration related activity as a whole 
this can now clearly be seen as changing  and we believe that industry spending will increase for a number of years to come 
regions that are emerging include many areas in west and south africa  nigeria  algeria  libya  saudi arabia  qatar  india and china  and the geomarkets that cover these regions all contributed to schlumberger growth in however  what is perhaps equally significant is the increase in exploration within known fields 
this is driven by the need to identify and access by passed or small accumulations of oil that can be tied back to existing infrastructure 
the north sea  parts of saudi arabia and russia are examples of this 

table of contents part ii  item in russia  and more particularly in west siberia  the production enhancement activity that restored production in the timeframe is now becoming a business focused on developing the remaining pockets of recoverable oil within producing reservoirs 
at the same time  continuing exploration activity offshore sakhalin  and burgeoning exploration in eastern siberia are contributing to rapid growth 
growth has been fueled both by organic expansion and by the acquisition of petroalliance services  which was completed in may to supply the russian market  we have continued to increase our in country product development and manufacturing with installations in tyumen and novosibirsk in western siberia 
the resurgence in exploration activity has led to substantial technology based growth for schlumberger 
westerngeco  as well as oilfield services wireline  drilling measurements and well testing services have all benefited from this as they are services that impact reservoir characterization and understanding 
growth  however  has been accelerated by a number of critical acquisitions 
in addition to the last tranche of petroalliance services in russia  schlumberger purchased the minority interest in westerngeco in the second quarter of this acquisition has removed the barriers to integration of a number of different measurement techniques that was not possible in a joint venture with a competitor 
but perhaps even more significantly  schlumberger made other acquisitions to extend its technology portfolio 
odegaard inversion software  terratek geomechanical expertise and reslink advanced completions solutions were three such examples in integrated project management has been a further avenue for growth that has responded to an emerging customer need in markets where the lack of skilled resources and the increase in international operations have posed challenges for a variety of industry operators 
in and schlumberger has focused on this market opportunity that responds to the need to increase production and reserves 
clear focus on bringing field and production management services as well as well construction services have had positive effects on returns and profitability has shown a marked improvement over prior years 
the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
stated in millions change change oilfield services operating revenue pretax segment income westerngeco operating revenue pretax segment income pretax segment income represents the business segments income before taxes and minority interest 
pretax segment income excludes corporate expenses  interest income  interest expense  amortization of certain intangibles  interest  stock based compensation costs and the charges and credits described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  as these items are not allocated to the segments 
oilfield services results revenue of billion increased in versus driven by growth in oilfield services activities as operators responded strongly to increasing global hydrocarbon demand through renewed exploration and increased focus on production operations 
within the geographic areas  north america revenue increased  europe cis africa increased  middle east asia increased and latin america increased 
pretax operating income of billion in grew by over resulting in operating margins climbing by basis points bps to reach a new record of 
stronger activity  accelerating higher margin new technology deployment and increased pricing across all areas were the principal contributors to this performance 

table of contents part ii  item among the geomarkets  the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in us land  followed by the arabian  russian  north sea  us gulf coast  canada  west south africa  nigeria and north africa geomarkets 
the growth in russia was driven by a combination of activity within the established geomarkets and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services 
significant demand was seen for all technologies as customers sought to improve exploration and production performance while mitigating technical risk in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 
a number of key acquisitions were made during the year 
these included the acquisition of the outstanding of petroalliance services in russia  as well as terratek a global leader in geomechanics measurements and analysis  odegaard a leader in advanced surface seismic data inversion software  and reslink a leading supplier of advanced completion solutions which offer a broad spectrum of engineering applications and products for sand management  zonal isolation and intelligent well completions

the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket recorded strong growth due to solid demand for drilling measurements technologies 
well services  wireline  completions and artificial lift technologies also contributed to growth 
in venezuela  discussions regarding new contracts for the drilling barges work and the settlement of certain outstanding receivables had progressed at the end of the year 
pending finalization of these new contracts  revenue recognition was deferred on certain work performed in the third and fourth quarters 
as the costs associated with this work were also deferred  this did not have a significant impact on the area s pretax operating income 
the latin america south geomarket registered strong growth due primarily to increased well services  drilling measurements  ipm and well testing activities  while growth in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket resulted from significant demand for drilling measurements  wireline and artificial lift technologies

europe cis africa revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the north sea  north africa  nigeria geomarkets and in russia 
strong revenue increases were recorded in russia and other cis countries despite the weather related slowdown in the first quarter  due to a combination of organic growth within schlumberger technology lines and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services 
renewed customer focus on exploration resulted in steep growth in the north sea and north africa geomarkets  while the west south africa and nigeria geomarkets maintained a robust growth momentum 
pretax operating income of billion in increased compared to all geomarkets contributed significantly through increased activity  improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment 
middle east asia revenue of billion in increased over with the largest increases recorded in the arabian  east africa east mediterranean and gulf geomarkets 
saudi arabia continued aggressive growth rates as activity increased rapidly  distinguishing the arabian geomarket as the fastest growing of all of the geomarkets 
growth in the east africa east mediterranean and gulf geomarkets was principally attributed to higher activity in drilling measurements and wireline services 
the brunei malaysia philippines  australia papua new guinea and thailand vietnam myanmar geomarkets also contributed to growth

oilfield services results revenue of billion increased in versus both latin america and europe cis africa increased  middle east asia increased and north america increased 
the strong activity levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than in demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery 
both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that strengthened across all oilfield services geographic areas 
pricing showed strong improvement in north america and continued to make excellent progress internationally 
customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of price escalation clauses in longer term contracts 
activity increased universally  with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in canada  us land  peru colombia ecuador  russia  nigeria  australasia  saudi arabia  and the arabian gulf 
both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than revenue growth in russia in versus demand for all technologies increased sharply  but particularly for well services and well completions productivity services

mexico recorded significant revenue growth  mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the burgos project  coupled with an overall rise in third party managed services revenue 
activity in venezuela increased primarily from ipm and well services operations 
during the year  continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a short term renewable agreement with pdvsa in early relating to the drilling barges work 
discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding receivables were still ongoing at year end 
the peru colombia ecuador geomarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the start of several new drilling measurements contracts for the expanding customer base 
the growth in the latin america south geomarket was primarily driven by increased ipm activity  although brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of drilling measurements and wireline technologies 
pretax operating income of million in increased versus this strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved drilling environment in venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in well services and drilling measurements services and across all geomarkets  particularly in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket 
europe cis africa revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the russia and nigeria geomarkets 
strong revenue increases were recorded offshore nigeria and in deepwater west africa geomarket operations mainly benefiting well completions productivity  wireline  and drilling measurements with the rapid market acceptance of scope technology 
the cis reached revenue of billion  an increase of over the significant increase in revenue in russia was due to a combination of organic growth  and the impact of the acquisitions of petroalliance and the siberian geophysical company 
organic growth in russia was driven by a recovery in activity for yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter  increased demand for stimulation and cementing services  strengthening of ipm operations  and robust uptake of new technology 
pretax operating income of million in increased compared to nigeria and west africa contributed significantly due to increased activity  pricing improvements  and accelerated technology deployment 
operating income in the north africa geomarket also increased markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  except as described below under westerngeco purchase accounting  under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight lined amortized value 

table of contents part ii  item the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
westerngeco purchase accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  on april   schlumberger acquired the minority interest in westerngeco from baker hughes incorporated for billion in cash 
as a result of this transaction  schlumberger owns of westerngeco 
during the process of allocating the purchase price to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values  schlumberger made certain significant estimates and assumptions relating to the accounting for westerngeco s vessels and multiclient seismic data 
in analyzing the fair value of the westerngeco vessels  it was determined that the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets exceeded the remaining estimated life currently being used to calculate depreciation expense 
therefore  the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels were extended an additional years on a weighted average basis as of the date of the acquisition 
the impact of the fair value adjustments for all fixed assets  combined with the change in estimate regarding the depreciable lives of the vessels  resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million in the carrying value of the multiclient library immediately after the acquisition increased to million from million  reflecting the impact of a million fair value adjustment 
these capitalized costs will be charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs on the balance sheet to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
schlumberger policy has been that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value 
after consideration of the estimated number of future years that revenues are expected to be derived from the multiclient seismic data at the time of the acquisition  schlumberger concluded that the remaining minimum amortization period should be years for all surveys in the multiclient seismic library at the time of the transaction  effectively resetting the minimum amortization period 
therefore  the million of capitalized multiclient seismic data costs will be charged to expense over a period no longer than the next years from the date of the transaction 
surveys comprising the million of multiclient seismic data costs prior to this transaction had a weighted average remaining life for purposes of computing the minimum amortization of approximately years 
given the current emphasis on requiring multiclient projects to be significantly prefunded before the project commences  schlumberger currently estimates that the majority of revenues to be derived from sales of new surveys will be achieved within a year period 
therefore  schlumberger will continue its policy that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value for all surveys added to the library after the date of this transaction 
the net impact of the million fair value adjustment combined with the resetting of the minimum amortization period resulted in an approximate million net reduction in multiclient amortization expense in as compared to what multiclient amortization expense would have been had this transaction not been consummated 

table of contents part ii  item allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas  schlumberger s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
from time to time a third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for  and long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
in order to estimate the fair value of a long lived asset  schlumberger may engage a third party to assist with the valuation 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that 
table of contents part ii  item the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 
contingencies the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for estimated future expenditures  relating to contractual obligations  associated with business divestitures that have been completed 
it is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded 
in the opinion of management  such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity  financial position or future results of operations 
the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated 
substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation 
due to a number of uncertainties  including uncertainty of timing  the scope of remediation  future technology  regulatory changes  natural resource or property damage claims and other factors  it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated 
however  in the opinion of management  any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity  financial position or future results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the discount rate utilized to determine both the liability for schlumberger s united states pension plans and for schlumberger s united states postretirement medical plans was increased from at december  to at december  the discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was reduced from in to in the change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation  are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was in both and a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both and was graded to over the next four years and thereafter

as a multinational company  schlumberger conducts its business in approximately countries 
schlumberger s functional currency is primarily the us dollar  which is consistent with the oil and gas industry 
approximately of schlumberger s operating revenue in was denominated in us dollars 
however  outside the united states  a significant portion of schlumberger s expenses are incurred in foreign currencies 
therefore  when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business  the us dollar reported expenses will decrease 
a change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in would have changed operating revenue by approximately 
if the average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by  schlumberger s income from continuing operations would have increased by 
conversely  a weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by 
schlumberger maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates 
foreign currency forward contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assets liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses
