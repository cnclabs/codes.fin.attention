off balance sheet arrangements 
at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements of the nature described in item a of regulation s k 
capital expenditures 
management anticipates that new non hotel based restaurants will cost between million and million per restaurant to build and open depending upon the size  location and available tenant allowances 
hotel based restaurants may involve remodeling existing facilities  substantial capital contributions from the hotel operators and other factors which will cause the cost to us of opening such restaurants to be less than our cost to build and open non hotel based restaurants 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be approximately million  primarily for the development of new restaurants  capital replacements and refurbishing or remodeling existing restaurants 
the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of free standing versus hotel based properties as hotel based restaurants are expected to generally require lower capital investment on our part 
in addition  if we open more or less restaurants or remodel more or less restaurants than we currently anticipate  our capital requirements will increase or decrease  accordingly 
in january we signed a lease to open an owned daily grill restaurant in austin  texas 
the new restaurant will be featured along the upscale main street center of the domain  a mixed use retail  residential and office village 
the restaurant is currently scheduled to open in the third quarter of construction of the restaurant is being paid for through a million tenant improvement allowance  existing cash and our credit facility

the restaurant is currently scheduled to open in late convertible securities and warrants 
we previously issued various convertible securities  warrants and common stock to finance restaurant openings in and shares of series ii  convertible preferred stock issued in that transaction remained outstanding at december  all warrants issued in that transaction expired in the series ii  convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock commencing one year from the date of issuance at the greater of i per share  or ii of the average closing price of our common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion  provided  however  that the conversion price shall in no event exceed per share

we received  from the exercise of  of the warrants 
the remaining shares were issued under cashless exercise provisions of the warrants and the balance of the warrants 
starwood alliance in conjunction with the july investment by starwood  we and starwood entered into the development agreement under which we and starwood agreed to jointly develop our restaurant properties in starwood hotels 
under the development agreement  either we or starwood may propose to develop a daily grill  grill or city bar and grill restaurant in a starwood hotel property 
if the parties agree in principal to the development of a restaurant  the parties will attempt to negotiate either a management agreement or a license agreement with respect to the operation of the restaurant 
under the development agreement  as amended by the first da amendment in  upon the opening of a fifth restaurant pursuant to the development agreement  we are obligated to issue to starwood warrants to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the outstanding shares upon opening of the fifth restaurant provided that such restaurant opens on or before april  or if the fifth restaurant does not open until after april   a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the shares outstanding at december  in addition to the warrants described above  if and when the aggregate number of restaurants operated under the development agreement exceeds of the total daily grill  grill and city grill branded restaurants  we will be obligated to issue to starwood a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the outstanding shares on that date exercisable for a period of five years at a price equal to the market price at that date

table of contents short term financing requirements management believes that we have adequate resources on hand and operating cash flow to sustain operations for at least the following months through mid we project increased operating cash flows in which  when added to existing cash balances and our credit facility  will allow us to meet all operating  investing and financing needs 
such projections are based on sales increases due to store openings  as well as modest increases in same store sales 
in the event of a decline in sales  as a result of deterioration of the economy or the hospitality industry or other factors  management believes it can respond to such a decrease in sales through cost controls  reductions in discretionary capital improvements and borrowings under the existing credit facility 
in order to fund the opening of additional restaurants  we might require additional capital that might be raised through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or the formation of additional investment or loan arrangements  or a combination thereof 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
principals of consolidation and minority interests 
our restaurant operations are conducted through multiple wholly owned subsidiaries as well as through five majority owned limited liability companies and through a owned joint venture 
our consolidated financial statements include balance sheet and income statement items  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions  of each wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary and entities consolidated under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
the allocated interest of the earnings or loss of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected in a single statement of operations entry  with minority interests in earnings being a reduction in net income and minority interests in losses being an increase in net income 
the proportionate interest in the equity of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected as a single balance sheet entry between liabilities and stockholders equity 
we allocate profits and losses to the minority interest in our majority owned subsidiaries based on the underlying economics of the investment 
these may or may not reflect our ownership percentage and can be inconsistent with the allocation provisions specified in the joint venture agreements 
where there is a disparity among the ownership percentages  the terms of the agreements and the underlying economics  we utilize a hypothetical liquidation model to allocate profits and losses 
under this model  all of the ventures assets and liabilities as reflected in the balance sheet are assumed to be realized at their gaap carrying values 
the hypothetical liquidating proceeds are calculated at the end of each period and applied to the capital accounts as would occur under a true liquidation scenario 
the change in this balance from period to period represents the investors share of the income or loss 
under fin  an entity is considered to be a variable interest entity vie when it has equity investors that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor is the primary beneficiary and will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 

table of contents management has assessed all entities that are not wholly owned by us to determine if these entities would be considered vies and whether we would be considered the primary beneficiary 
it was determined that all of the following entities would be considered vies the san jose grill llc  chicago the grill on the alley llc  the grill on hollywood llc  the daily grill at continental park llc  flower daily grill llc and the universal citywalk daily grill joint partnership 
we determined that we are the primary beneficiary for all these entities 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review all long lived assets on a regular basis to determine if there has been impairment in the value of those assets 
if  upon review  it is determined that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable  we will record a charge to earnings and reduce the value of the asset on the balance sheet to the amount determined to be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted cash flows of the individual restaurants and consolidated undiscounted net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual restaurants compared to the related carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on our review of our presently operating restaurants and other long lived assets  during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded no impairments of our long lived assets 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we review all of our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine the collectability of each account based on age  response to collection efforts  and other factors 
we establish a reserve for those accounts where collection seems doubtful 
if a determination is made that the customer will definitely not pay  the amount is written off against the reserve 
based on our review at december   the current reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable is adequate 
recording reimbursable costs 
we operate a number of restaurants under management agreements whereby we are responsible for all aspects of restaurant operation 
for our services  we typically receive a management fee based on a percentage of revenue and an incentive fee that is usually a profit sharing arrangement 
under the terms of the management agreements  we are hired as an independent contractor and are responsible for all debts and liabilities of the restaurant 
additionally  all employees are employees of grill concepts  not the individual restaurant 
although payroll and other operating expenses are paid out of an agency bank account belonging to the restaurant  based on the weight of the indicators identified in eift  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we consider ourselves the primary obligor in these arrangements 
accordingly  we recognize restaurant expenses of the managed outlets in our financial statements and record the reimbursement for such expenses as revenues 
hrp 
we were party to mirroring put and call options whereby hrp had the right to require us to buy hrp and we had the right to buy hrp on substantially identical terms 
we concluded that the options relating to hrp would be defined as a derivative under fas however  because the purchase price was based on a floating price  it was determined that the value of the put and call would be identical so long as the formula resulted in a representative fair value of hrp 

table of contents we concluded that the multiple was based on fair value because the original formula was negotiated between two parties 
this fact was reconfirmed when the hrp agreement was amended approximately three years later at the time we entered into a development agreement with starwood hotels and the multiple for the hrp put and call options did not change 
we believe the multiple used in the formula to be within a tolerable range of those found in the marketplace 
therefore  management believes that the formula was a reasonable approximation of fair value of the hrp business that results in the put and call options having similar values 
additionally  because fair market puts and calls have little value on their own  any asset and liability related to these would be insignificant 
no derivative accounting is necessary in these circumstances and therefore  no accounting recognition has been made in the financial statements 
the put and call options were terminated in pursuant to the hrp purchase agreement 
as a result  we no longer are required to evaluate the appropriateness of the formula to assure that it represents fair market value 
new accounting requirements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on its financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach  as those terms are defined in sab the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the impact of the misstatement  whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the reversing effect of prior year misstatements on the income statement 
financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
if a company determines that an adjustment to prior year financial statements is required upon adoption of sab and does not elect to restate its previous financial statements  then it must recognize the cumulative effect of applying sab in fiscal beginning balances of the affected assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the fiscal opening balance in retained earnings 
sab is effective for the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition associated with tax positions 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company interprets that the evaluation of a tax position is a two 
table of contents step process 
the first step is recognition 
the company is required to determine whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the merits of the position 
in making the more likely than not examination  the presumption is the position will be examined and the tax authorities will have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company is in the process of quantifying and determining the company s federal and state tax positions 
the company will disclose any tax issues in accordance with the financial interpretation no 
in its form q for the quarter ended april  in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting sales taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
if taxes are significant  an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amounts of taxes 
eitf is effective for periods beginning after december  the company presents sales taxes collected from customers on a net basis 
the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to impact its method for presenting sales taxes in its financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in sfas r  share based payment  or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp 
an entity that adopts sfas r using the modified prospective application may make a one time election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp 
an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election 
this fsp became effective in november the company has elected not to use the alternative transition method as described in the fsp 
in october  the fasb posted fasb staff position fsp  which requires that rental costs incurred during and after a construction period for the right to control the use of a leased asset during and after construction of a lessee asset to be recognized as rental expense 
the provisions of fsp shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after december  the company s existing accounting policy for rental costs incurred during and after the construction period conforms to fsp the adoption of fsp did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impractical 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion  accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 effective in management currently believes that adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past two years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
our cost of operations have been affected by several increases in the federal and state minimum wage in recent years 
in addition  further increases in the minimum wage are also being discussed by the federal and various state governments 
although we have been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along some increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our credit line facility 
at december   borrowings under the credit line totaled approximately million 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the lender s prime rate or libor 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have a material impact on our results of operations
