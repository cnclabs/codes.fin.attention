item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those statements 
this discussion consists of the following sections executive overview a description of our business  financial highlights from  information about industry trends and sources of revenues and operating costs  critical accounting policies and estimates a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements  results of operations a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation  a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for  as restated for certain expenses  and  including comparisons between years and expectations for  and liquidity and capital resources a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity  an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  a discussion of our dividend policy and a summary of our contractual cash obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
executive overview we believe that we are one of the largest and most diversified television broadcasting companies in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements lmas or provide  or are provided  sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to television stations in markets 
for the purpose of this report  these stations are referred to as our stations 
we currently have duopoly markets where we own and operate two stations within the same market 
we have ten lma markets where  with one exception  we own and operate one station in the market and provide or are provided programming and operating services to  or by  another station within the market 
in the remaining markets  we own and operate a single television station 
we believe that owning duopolies and operating stations under lmas enables us to accomplish two very important strategic business objectives increasing our share of revenues available in each market and operating television stations more efficiently by minimizing costs 
we constantly monitor revenue share and cost efficiencies and we aggressively pursue opportunities to improve both by using new technology and by sharing best practices among our station groups 
sinclair television group  inc stg  a wholly owned subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group  inc sbg  is the primary obligor under our existing bank credit agreement  as amended  the senior subordinated notes  due  which were redeemed in full on january   and the senior subordinated notes  due our class a common stock  class b common stock  the convertible debentures  due and the convertible senior notes  due remain obligations or securities of sbg and are not obligations or securities of stg 
highlights during  we continued to monetize our retransmission consent agreements 
our retransmission consent agreements generated million in broadcast revenues during  an increase of over the incremental value created from our agreements is expected to grow in through further monetization 
we expect total revenue generation from our agreements to be significantly greater in during  a non presidential election year  political revenues were million  which is substantially the same amount we earned in the presidential election year  operating income decreased in due to an impairment of million related to a market s goodwill and definite lived intangible assets  we increased our quarterly dividend rate from to per share beginning with the october dividend payment 
the quarterly dividend rate per share increased again to on february we repurchased  in the open market  million face value of our convertible debentures  due and million face value of our senior subordinated notes  due  we renewed our affiliation agreement with the fox network for our fox affiliates for another six years  we entered into affiliation agreements  which expire august  with cw television network for nine of our former wb and independent stations  we entered into affiliation agreements  which expire september  with mynetworktv for of our former wb  upn and independent stations  our television station in baltimore  maryland  wbff tv  went live on may  with wbff dt channel  the market s first multi digital channel to carry syndicated and other local programming  we entered into a news share arrangement in which our television station in springfield champaign  illinois wics wicd tv began producing an evening news program for television stations in springfield  illinois wrsp tv and urbana  illinois wccu tv effective september  our fox affiliate  kbsi tv in cape girardeau  paducah and harrisburg  entered into a news share arrangement with the nbc affiliate  wpsd tv in the same market effective october  we entered into a news share arrangement in which our cbs affiliate  wgme tv in portland  maine began producing a pm newscast for portland s fox affiliate  wpfo tv  beginning february our fox affiliate  wdky tv in lexington  kentucky expanded its news share arrangement with wkyt tv  the cbs affiliate in that market  to add a one hour morning newscast beginning at am  effective march we launched morning news programming in dayton  ohio on wkef tv and wrgt tv as an expansion of the stations already successful evening news programming  we redefined the mission of our news central operations to improve the quality  profitability and competitiveness of our local newscasts  and we announced the redemption of our senior subordinated notes  due  which we redeemed  in full  on january industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is elevated further due to the presidential election  seasonal advertising increases in the second and fourth quarters due to the advertising expenditures related to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  not all cable system operators and satellite providers pay for the analog or digital signals they receive from broadcasters  but we expect more operators and providers will be paying for these signals in the future as alternative competing video delivery providers increase  compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has significantly declined in recent years and may be eliminated in the future in lieu of alternative network and affiliate relationships  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues have been trending downward in recent years and we expect this trend to continue in  the federal communications commission fcc has mandated that beginning february   all broadcast television stations must broadcast using only a digital signal and will no longer be able to broadcast using an analog signal  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream 
we have launched several digital channels using our tv stations digital signal during  many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers  and retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from multi channel video programming distributors mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value provided by broadcasters  including digital and high definition signals and popular network programming  in addition to increased competition among video delivery providers  has increased this payment stream 
we expect this trend to continue as the demand for high definition signals grows and competition among video delivery providers continues in the market 
sources of revenues and costs most of our revenues are generated from the transactional spot market rather than the traditional up front and scatter markets that networks access 
these operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
recently  we have begun to generate revenues from our retransmission consent agreements 
these agreements have helped to produce a new  viable revenue stream that has replaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation 
we expect further monetization of our agreements and strong revenue growth over the next fiscal year 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of gross broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasing competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency and national representatives commissions  are recognized in the period during which time spots are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that our agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase of the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately million 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
in conjunction with our nrv analysis of programming rights reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  we perform similar analysis on future programming rights yet to be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and establish allowances when future payments exceed the estimated nrv 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis along with our goodwill 
we test our broadcast licenses and goodwill by estimating the fair market value of the broadcast licenses  or the net assets for each of our markets in the case of goodwill  using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings multiples paid for comparable television stations  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses and or goodwill could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relating to various federal and state net operating losses nol that are carried forward 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available federal and state nols 
we evaluate the need and extent of a valuation allowance based on the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book tax differences  alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  if there is a material change in our projected taxable income  or if there is a change in our ability to use nol carryforwards due to changes in federal and state laws  we will make any necessary adjustments to the valuation allowance 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary 
restructuring costs during the year ended december   we incurred costs associated with restructuring the news operations at certain of our stations 
specifically  on or before march   we ceased our locally produced news broadcasts in nine of our markets and consequently let go our news employees and cancelled our news related contracts 
we recorded restructuring charges in station production expenses 
the major components of the restructuring charges and the remaining accrual balance related to the restructuring plan as of december  follow in thousands salary and severance costs contract expenses other exit costs total balance at december  restructuring charges amounts utilized balance at december  all restructuring costs were associated with our broadcast segment 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of grants of various stock based compensation programs over the vesting period of the awards 
we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective application transition method which does not result in the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements 
for additional information regarding our accounting under sfas r  see note stock based compensation plans in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition of positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
only tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold of being sustained are recognized under fin fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification of interest and penalties and accounting and disclosures for annual and interim financial statements 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  the cumulative effect of any changes arising from the initial application of fin is required to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement will be effective for the year ending december  we are currently evaluating the effect this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas required us to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of our pension plan in our december  consolidated financial statements  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
at adoption  the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million net of taxes of million represented the net unrecognized actuarial losses which we previously netted against the plan s funded status in our consolidated financial statements pursuant to the provisions of statement this amount will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost are recognized as increases or decreases in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these gains or losses will be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension costs 
as of december   we have also recognized a liability of million representing the under funded status of our defined benefit pension plan  which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future years 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the two methods for evaluating misstatements are referred to as the rollover method and the iron curtain method 
the rollover method quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatements that exist in the current year income statement  including misstatements that arose in the current year  as well as  the reversal or correction of the misstatements that arose in prior years 
the iron curtain method quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatements that exist in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  regardless of the misstatement s year of origin 
sab does not change the guidance in sab  materiality sab  when evaluating the materiality of misstatements 
upon initial application  sab permits a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings to correct prior year misstatements 
we adopted sab during and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million net of income taxes of million  to increase retained earnings as of january  the adjustment was comprised of the following components in millions increase decrease to net income years affected cumulative amortization expense not recognized due to the misapplication of useful lives related to a definite lived intangible asset and leasehold improvements increase to operating income resulting from the over accrual of accrued liabilities and deferred revenue decreases to other income due to an error in the accounting for the consolidation of one of our variable interest entities tax effects attributable to above adjustments at our applicable effective tax rates decrease in provision for income taxes resulting from the over accrual of tax reserves and balance sheet book to tax basis differences net impact on january  retained earnings under the rollover method of evaluating misstatements  we previously concluded that the misstatements noted above were immaterial to all prior years results 
the misstatements under the iron curtain method described in sab  as well as  the provisions of sab  are material to results and therefore  have been reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  results of operations in general  this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations  except for discussions regarding our cash flows which also include the results of our discontinued operations

see political revenues below for more information 
our largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net time sales were automotive  professional services  paid programming  fast food  schools  retail and political 
no other advertising category accounted for more than of our net time sales in along with the industry  we have seen softness in the automotive advertising category and we expect this to continue in we conduct business with thousands of advertisers 
other than advertisers from our automotive category  no other advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated net time sales in net broadcast revenues 
from a revenue category standpoint  the year ended december   when compared to  was impacted by an increase of advertising revenues generated from the political  telecommunications  restaurant other  schools  movies and home products sectors  offset by decreases in the internet  toys games  food breakfast  soft drinks and travel leisure sectors 
automotive  our single largest category  representing of the year s net time sales  was down 
we expect automotive sales to trend downward during political revenues 
both local and national political revenues were the primary drivers of higher revenue in and  compared to because and were election years 
in fact  during  we owned television stations in of the so called battleground states  including multiple stations in ohio  florida and west virginia 
we expect political revenues to decrease in from levels  because is not an election year 
local revenues 
our revenues from local advertisers  excluding political revenues  increased during the last three years 
we continue to focus on increasing local advertising revenues through innovative sales and marketing strategies in our markets 
revenues from our new business initiatives increased million during to million from million in revenues from our new business initiatives increased by million in from million during we expect to continue our focus on new business revenues in additionally  during  we implemented an enhanced sales training course for all of our salespeople with a focus on local revenue sales 
we have continued these efforts throughout and will continue these efforts in national revenues 
our revenues from national advertisers  excluding political revenues  have continued to trend downward over time 
we believe this trend represents a shift in the way national advertising dollars are being spent and we believe it has recently begun accelerating 
advertisers in major categories like automotive  soft drink and packaged goods are shifting significant portions of their advertising budgets away from spot television into non traditional media  in store promotions and product placement in network shows 
automotive decreases are due to automotive companies reducing advertising budgets and shifting advertising to specific markets 
we expect this trend to continue into other revenues and expenses 
our other revenues consist primarily of revenues from retransmission consent agreements with cable and satellite providers  network compensation  production revenues and revenues from our outsourcing agreements 
our retransmission consent agreements  including the advertising component  generated million in total broadcast revenues during compared with million in and million in this growth trend is the result of our ability to monetize our existing relationships as cable providers struggle with increased competition from alternative video delivery providers and have begun to recognize the value of our digital and high definition signals and network programming 
pursuant to eitf  during  million of the total million in revenues generated from our retransmission consent agreements are included in other revenues while the remaining million is included in net time sales 
during  million of the total million in revenues generated from our retransmission consent agreements are included in other revenues while the remaining million is included in net time sales

station production expenses for decreased compared to in  we experienced decreases in news expenses of million related to the shutdown of news central at several stations  rating service fees of million and programming expenses of million 
these decreases were offset by increases in costs related to lmas and outsourcing agreements of million  engineering expenses of million  music license fees of million  promotion expenses of million  production expenses of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
station production expenses decreased during the year ended december  compared to primarily due to decreases in costs related to lmas and outsourcing agreements of million 
in addition  there were also decreases in promotion expense due to cutbacks in promotional plans amounting to million  news costs of million  programming expenses of million  production expenses of million  music license fees of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
these decreases were offset by increases in engineering expenses of million  rating service fees of million  salary expense of million and fox inventory costs of million 
station selling  general and administrative expenses 
station selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared to the same period in as a result of increases in general and administrative expenses primarily related to salary and bonus increases of million  bad debt expense of million  audit and accounting fees of million and insurance  utilities and other net costs of million 
in addition  there was an increase in national representative commissions costs of million 
these increases were offset by decreases in traffic expense of million  sales expenses of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
station selling  general and administrative expense decreased during compared to as a result of decreases in sales expenses related to direct mailers of million  local and national sales representatives commissions of million  salary expense of million  workers compensation refunds of million  expenses related to an annual sales trip of million  bad debt expenses of million and electric expenses of million 
these decreases were offset by a one time adjustment of million to our self insured healthcare plan during the third quarter of  increases in expense for cunningham broadcasting corporation  a related party entity that we consolidate  of million and vacation expense of million 
we expect station production and station selling  general and administrative expenses excluding barter to be up slightly from amortization of program contract costs 
the amortization of program contract costs increased during compared to primarily due to significant program additions in the amortization decrease during compared to was primarily because the costs to acquire syndicated programming had been declining 
we expect program contract amortization expense to relatively flat in when compared to depreciation of property and equipment 
the depreciation of property and equipment decreased in compared to the decrease is primarily related to a large number of assets that had become fully depreciated during this decrease is offset by depreciation associated with capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  as we completed the final phase of our digital build out 
additionally  during  a million impairment was recognized for certain capitalized software costs that became obsolete as a result of our conversion to a new revenue billing system during the second quarter of we expect depreciation on property and equipment to decrease in when compared to however  capital expenditures are expected to be greater in corporate general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent the costs to operate our corporate headquarters location 
such costs include  among other things  corporate departmental salaries  bonuses and fringe benefits  directors and officers life insurance  rent  telephone  consulting fees  legal  accounting  director fees and strategic development initiatives 
corporate departments include executive  treasury  finance and accounting  human resources  technology  corporate relations  legal  sales  operations and purchasing 
corporate general and administrative expense for increased compared to the same period in due to increases of million related to the shutdown of news central at several stations and other strategic development initiatives related to news  salary and bonus expense of million  legal fees of million  restricted and unrestricted stock compensation costs of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
these increases were offset by property and general insurance reimbursements of million  workers compensation refunds of million  decreases in health care costs of million and audit and accounting fees of million 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased during compared to as a result of decreases in salary and training expense related to open positions of million  consulting fees of million and sales promotion of million 
these decreases were offset by an increase in expense of million related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as the million increase related to our charitable contributions to the sinclair relief fund  a related party charitable organization established in response to the disaster caused by hurricane katrina 
we expect corporate overhead expenses to increase slightly in interest expense 
interest expense presented in the financial statements is related to continuing operations 
interest expense has been decreasing since the decrease during compared to is due to the expiration of two interest rate swap agreements  a decrease of interest related to derivative instruments  and the repurchase of senior subordinated notes  due the decrease was offset by increases due to the accretion of a debt discount as a result of the redemption of our series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for convertible debentures in the second quarter of and interest expense related to amended state income tax returns 
the decrease during when compared to is primarily related to the use of proceeds from television station sales to repay debt during  partially offset by rising interest rates on our floating rate debt and by the accretion of a debt discount due to the exchange of our series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for convertible debentures  which increased interest expense 
we expect interest expense to be less in then in  assuming no changes in the current interest rate yield curve or changes in our assumption of debt levels for unrealized gain from derivative instruments 
we record gains and losses related to certain of our derivative instruments 
we entered into these instruments prior to implementing sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and they did not qualify as effective hedges as that term is defined in the accounting guidance 
generally  when derivative instruments are not effective  the change in the fair value of the instruments is recorded in the statement of operations for each respective period 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is primarily based on the anticipated future interest rate curves at the end of each period 
during  certain instruments expired resulting in a reduction in unrealized gain 
gain on insurance settlement 
in the first quarter of  one of our towers in charleston  west virginia collapsed during a severe ice storm 
this tower was insured and we used the insurance proceeds to rebuild the tower and to replace the other assets that were destroyed by the collapse 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed substantially all of the construction of the new tower and placed it in service  and at that time we recognized a gain on insurance settlement of million 
in  we recognized a gain on insurance settlement of million related to rebuilding the tower and replacing the other assets that were destroyed by the collapse 
we did not receive any additional payments or gains related to this claim in impairment of intangibles 
on a periodic basis  we test our goodwill for impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting rules 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in and  we recorded impairments of million and million  respectively  related to goodwill in two different markets 
in addition  during  we wrote down a decaying advertiser based definite lived intangible asset by million

the income tax provision for our pre tax income from continuing operations of million resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is primarily attributable to the release of discrete tax and related interest reserves as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for the federal income tax returns for through we expect that the effective tax rate will increase to more normalized levels in as of december   we had a net deferred tax liability of million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of million as of december  the increase in deferred taxes primarily relates to a decrease in deferred tax assets associated with additional valuation allowances recorded to reflect a change in judgment with respect to realizability of state net operating losses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
we account for derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
collectively  sfas 
for additional information on sfas  see note derivative instruments  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on april   we terminated two of our derivative instruments with a cash payment of million  the aggregate fair value of the derivative liabilities on that date 
these swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas and changes in their fair market values were reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt that was being hedged 
therefore  on the termination date  the carrying value of the underlying debt was adjusted to reflect the million payment and that amount will be treated as a discount on the underlying debt that was being hedged and will be amortized over its remaining life  in accordance with sfas amortization of the discount of million was recorded as interest expense for the year ended december  on june   two of our derivative instruments expired 
these expired swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and  therefore  the changes in their fair market values were reflected in historical earnings as an unrealized gain from derivative instruments through the expiration date 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded an unrealized gain of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we have two remaining derivative instruments 
one of these swap agreements is accounted for as a fair value hedge in accordance with sfas  therefore  any changes in its fair market value are reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying debt being hedged 
during  one of our swap agreements was undesignated as a fair value hedge due to a reassignment of the counterparty  therefore  any changes in the fair market value are reflected as an adjustment to income 
the notional amount of these swap agreements is million and they expire on march  the interest we pay is floating based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus and the interest we receive is at 
the fair market value of these agreements is estimated by obtaining quotations from the international financial institution party to the contract 
this fair value is an estimate of the net amount that we would pay on december  if we cancelled the contracts or transferred them to other parties and includes net accrued interest receivable 
this amount was a net asset of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
to determine the sensitivity of these derivative instruments to changes in interest rates  we also obtain quotations from the party to the contract that estimate the pro forma fair market value of the instruments on december  if current interest rates were higher by or lower by 
as of december   the fair market value of these instruments would be a liability of million if interest rates were higher and an asset of million if interest rates were lower than current rates 
during may  we completed an issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes  due under certain circumstances  we will pay contingent cash interest to the holder of the convertible notes during any six month period from january to july and from july to january  commencing with the six month period beginning january  the contingent interest feature is an embedded derivative which had a negligible fair value as of december  we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior subordinated notes with face amounts totaling million and million and convertible senior bonds totaling million and million expiring in the years   and  respectively 
based on the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes and bonds was billion as of december  generally  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by million as of december  the estimates related to the increase or decrease of interest rates are based on assumptions for forecasted future interest rates 
the fair value of the notes and bonds was billion as of december  and at that time we estimated that a increase in prevailing interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of million in fair value 
this indicates that our exposure to risk from a change in interest rates has not materially changed since december  on january   we redeemed in full our senior subordinated notes  due
