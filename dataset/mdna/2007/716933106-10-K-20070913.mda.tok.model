overview pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of products that improve existing therapeutic approaches to cancer and other diseases 
to date  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not expect to generate any product revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals and launch one of our products  if at all 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products generates sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our products under development  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
xcytrin  our lead product candidate  is an anti cancer drug being evaluated in various clinical trials 
based on the clinical activity seen in our initial phase trial in a subset of patients with brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer nsclc  we conducted a pivotal phase clinical trial to confirm the potential clinical benefits observed in patients with brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer 
this trial  known as the smart study of neurologic progression with motexafin gadolinium and radiation therapy trial  enrolled patients with brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer 
the smart trail was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of whole brain radiation therapy wbrt alone to wbrt plus xcytrin 
the primary endpoint for the study was time to neurologic progression tnp as determined by a blinded events review committee 
in december  we submitted a new drug application nda to the food and drug administration fda for the use of xcytrin in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from nsclc 
in february  we received a refuse to file letter from the fda citing failure to demonstrate statistically significant differences between treatment arms in the primary endpoint of the pivotal study to support approval 
in the pivotal smart trial  investigators found that patients given xcytrin in addition to wbrt had a median time to neurologic progession of months  compared to months for patients who received only wbrt p  hazard ratio  a trend in favor of xcytrin 
in april  we requested that the fda file our nda over protest 
file over protest is a procedure permitted by fda regulations  which allows sponsors to have their nda filed and reviewed when there is disagreement over the acceptability of the nda 
in april  we announced that the fda had filed our nda 
the prescription drug user fee act pdufa date for completion of review by fda is december  the fda has also designated xcytrin as an orphan drug for the treatment of brain metastases arising from solid tumors 
we also are evaluating xcytrin for the treatment of a diverse range of cancer types and in various clinical situations including xcytrin as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and or radiation therapy 
one of xcytrin s chemical features allows it to be visualized in the body using standard magnetic resonance imaging mri procedures 
using mri  we have established that xcytrin localizes selectively in cancers 
we own the worldwide rights to xcytrin 
we are also developing several other oncology drugs 
pci is a novel compound that inhibits all isoforms of hdac enzymes 
in the cell nucleus  dna is present with proteins as part of a tightly compacted complex called chromatin 
hdac enzymes play a role in modifying the structure of chromatin  allowing dna transcription a process by which dna controls cellular activity to occur 
hdac inhibitors appear to alter the transcription process 
hdac inhibitors target tumors through multiple mechanisms  and laboratory studies have shown that they can prompt cells to stop growing or die 
this may happen through the expression of tumor suppressor genes  the prevention of angiogenesis  and the targeting of various critical proteins 
pci is now in a phase trial in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the objective of the trial is to determine the drug s safety and tolerability  when given intravenously  and also to assess absorption and plasma levels of the drug following oral administration 
studies indicate that pci achieves sustained plasma levels following oral administration 
we believe pci has desirable potency and pharmacokinetic properties  which may provide clinical advantages 
laboratory studies also demonstrate that pci inhibits homologous recombination  a cellular mechanism of dna repair 
these data suggest that pci could be used successfully in combination with other cancer therapies that generate dna damage repaired by homologous recombination  such as gamma irradiation  cisplatin  and certain other chemotherapy drugs 
an hdac selective inhibitor is now in preclinical testing 
we believe that this compound may exhibit more selectivity for certain types of cancer and may be useful for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
pci is a small molecule inhibitor of factor viia 
this molecule selectively inhibits factor viia when it is complexed with a protein called tissue factor tf 
in cancer  the factor viia tf complex is found in abundance in pancreatic  gastric  colon and other tumors  and triggers a host of physiologic processes that facilitate tumor angiogenesis  growth and invasion 
laboratory studies and animal models indicate that inhibitors of factor viia may block tumor growth and metastasis 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies to support the potential filing of an investigational new drug ind  applilication with the fda 
pci is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
when immune cells called b lymphocytes are overactive  the immune system produces inflammatory cells and antibodies that begin to attack the body s own tissue  leading to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
we are developing compounds that can inhibit an enzyme  known as btk  which is required for early b cells to mature into fully functioning cells 
in published studies  these compounds have demonstrated a dose dependent ability to inhibit disease development in rheumatoid arthritis animal models 
recent studies have shown that these compounds may inhibit the proliferation of lymphoma cells  or malignancies involving b cells  indicating their potential for treatment of certain lymphomas and leukemias 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies to support the potential filing of an ind application with the fda 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  build a us commercial oncology franchise  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonable assured 
license revenue is typically recognized over the term of the arrangement and milestone revenue is recognized when earned as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestone and the absence of any on going obligation 
license  milestone  contract and grant revenues are not subject to repayment 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenues 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at june   all other investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
to date we have had no declines in fair value that have been identified as other than temporary 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials  manufacturing and process development  research and other consulting activities  costs are expensed as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
share based compensation we adopted sfas r  share based payments  effective beginning july  using the modified prospective application transition method 
the modified prospective application transition method requires that companies recognize compensation expense on new share based payment awards and existing share based payment awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost of the portion of awards of which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the july  shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of the company s stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as the company does not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst its employee population 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the company s options 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for the company in fiscal years beginning july  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
due to diversity in practice among registrants  sab expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and early application is encouraged 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective the first quarter of our fiscal year with early adoption permitted 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that the implementation of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which  among other things  requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the provisions of fin will be effective for us on july  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on the financial statements  but we do not expect its adoption to have a significant effect 
results of operations revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our revenue over the last three fiscal years change change grant and contract revenues   revenues in fiscal years and were the result of a federal grant awarded by the national institutes of health nih 
work under this grant was completed in fiscal year research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our research and development r d expenses over the last three fiscal years change change research and development expenses    r d expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  in outside clinical trial costs due to the completion of the smart trial  a decrease of  in share based compensation expense  a decrease of  in drug manufacturing costs and a decrease of  in personnel and consulting expenses due to lower average headcount and reduced use of consultants 
these cost decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in preclinical study costs 
r d expenses in fiscal increased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of  in share based compensation and an increase of  in drug manufacturing costs  partially offset by a  decrease in third party clinical trial costs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
prior to  we did not track our historical research and development costs by specific program and for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis

we expect general and administrative expenses in the first half of fiscal to decrease over the comparable period of fiscal purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expense for the years ended june   and was   and  respectively 
the amount in fiscal was due to our acquisition  in april  of multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business 
one drug candidate is in a phase clinical trial while the other drug candidates are in pre clinical development 
total consideration paid was  which consisted of  shares of our common stock   of cash and  of transaction costs 
we recorded an expense of  related to the consideration for the acquired drug candidates which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use due to the early stage of development and the significant regulatory requirements remaining 
interest and other  net 
interest and other  net  was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increases in the years ended june  and were primarily due to higher average interest rates earned on the company s investments 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
a full valuation allowance has been established for the company s deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital since inception have been private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment  leasehold improvements  and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash provided by used by investing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of the net effect of purchases  maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock  the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in november  we completed a public offering of common stock and sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately  in february  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell  from time to time  equity  debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
we may seek to raise funds through additional public offerings in the future but cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful 
in august  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth opportunity ltd  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement  azimuth is committed to purchase  at our discretion  up to million of our common stock  or  shares  whichever occurs first  at a discount of to  to be determined based on our market capitalization at the start of each sale period 
the term of the purchase agreement is months 
upon each sale of our common stock to azimuth under the purchase agreement  we have also agreed to pay reedland capital partners a placement fee equal to one percent of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth 
azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock if the price of our common stock falls below per share 
we to date  have not sold any stock to azimuth 
our future contractual obligations at june  are as follows operating lease commitments less than year  years  total  in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business 
future milestone payments under the agreement could total as much as million  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
in addition  celera will also be entitled to royalty payments in the mid to high single digits based on annual sales of any drugs commercialized from these programs 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect the increases in research and development expenses as a result of on going and future clinical trials to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private financings  collaborative relationships partnerships with other drug manufacturers or other arrangements to complete commercialization 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the progress and success of clinical trials of our product candidates  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish and the scope of any new collaborations  and the timing and scope of commercialization expenses for xcytrin 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors we will need additional financing and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by  the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates fiscal year fair valu e total at june  marketable securities     weighted average interest rate
