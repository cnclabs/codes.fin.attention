item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail in kansas and at wholesale in a multi state region in the central united states under the regulation of the kcc and ferc 
in management s discussion and analysis  we discuss our general financial condition  significant changes that occurred during  and our operating results for the years ended december   and as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which contain our operating results 
summary of significant items overview several significant items have impacted or may impact us and our operations since january  portions of the kcc order were challenged and ultimately reversed by the kcc 
see changes in rates below for additional information  we implemented the reca which allows us to adjust our prices to correspond with changes in the costs we incur for fuel and purchased power  we purchased a mw peaking power plant  announced plans to build a mw peaking power plant and announced plans to expand our electric transmission network 
see increased capacity and future plans below for additional information  we plan to install emissions control equipment at jeffrey energy center and some of our other coal plants 
due to increasing prices of labor and materials  we increased the estimated costs of installing this equipment at our power plants 
for additional information  see liquidity and capital resources future cash requirements  the convictions of david c 
wittig and douglas t 
lake were overturned 
see convictions of david c 
wittig and douglas t 
lake overturned below for additional information  we received million in proceeds from corporate owned life insurance in and million in  and we took measures  including the acquisition of additional rail cars and the conservation of coal  that when coupled with changes at the mines and with the railroads  resulted in improved coal deliveries 
see coal inventory and delivery below for additional information 
changes in rates in accordance with a kcc order  on may   we filed applications with the kcc for it to review our retail electric rates 
the kcc order authorized changes in our rates  which we began billing in the first quarter of  and approved various other changes to our rate structures 
in april  interveners filed appeals with the kansas court of appeals challenging various aspects of the kcc order 
on july   the kansas court of appeals reversed and remanded for further consideration by the kcc three elements of the kcc order 
the balance of the kcc order was upheld 
on february   the kcc issued an order in response to the kansas court of appeals decision regarding the kcc order 
in its february  order the kcc i confirmed its original decision regarding its treatment of the la cygne unit sale leaseback transaction  ii in lieu of a transmission delivery charge  ruled that it intends to permit us to recover our transmission related costs in a manner similar to how we recover our other costs  and iii reversed itself with regard to the inclusion in depreciation rates of a component for terminal net salvage 
the february  kcc order requires us to refund to our customers the amount we have collected related to terminal net salvage 
we have recorded a regulatory liability at december  in the amount of million related to this item 
increased capacity and future plans on october   we purchased a mw electric generation facility and related assets from oneok energy services company  lp oesc for million 
as part of this transaction  we entered into an agreement to provide oesc with mw of capacity through in august  we announced plans to build a new natural gas fired combustion turbine peaking power plant near emporia in lyon county  kansas 
we expect the new plant  which we have named the emporia energy center  to have an initial generating capacity of up to mw  with additional capacity to be added in a second phase  bringing the total capacity to approximately mw 
we expect the total investment in the plant to be about million 
we plan to begin construction on the new plant in the spring of the initial phase of the plant is scheduled to begin operation in the summer of in september  we announced plans to build a transmission line from our gordon evans energy center northwest of wichita  kansas  to a new substation near hutchison  kansas  then onto our summit substation near salina  kansas  a distance totaling approximately miles 
in january  we filed an application with the kcc to request permission to build the line 
kansas law requires the kcc to issue an order within days of our filing regarding our application 
if the kcc issues a permit for us to proceed  we expect to complete construction in our preliminary cost estimate for the project is million to million 
this estimate could change materially as engineering and construction proceed 
in addition to this line  we plan additional expansions to our electric transmission network in kansas 
these include a new line from our rose hill substation near wichita to the kansas oklahoma border  where we expect to interconnect with new facilities built by an oklahoma based utility  and a new line from our jeffrey energy center to an existing substation about miles south of topeka  kansas 
convictions of david c 
wittig and douglas t 
lake overturned on september   david c 
wittig  our former chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and douglas t 
lake  our former executive vice president  chief strategic officer and member of the board  were convicted on various criminal charges by a jury in a trial held in us district court in kansas 
the jury also determined that mr 
wittig and mr 
lake should forfeit to the united states certain property that it determined was derived from their criminal conduct 
the court subsequently awarded us certain of the property forfeited by mr 
wittig and mr 
lake 
on january   the us tenth circuit court of appeals overturned these convictions and forfeiture orders 
at december   we had accrued liabilities totaling approximately million for compensation not yet paid to mr 
wittig and mr 
lake under various plans  and we had also accrued approximately million for legal fees and expenses incurred by mr 
wittig and mr 
lake in the defense of these charges and related appeals 
we believe mr 
wittig and mr 
lake are not entitled to this compensation 
this dispute  and claims mr 
wittig and mr 
lake have made against us  are the subject of an arbitration that has been stayed pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings 
we also believe the amounts sought by mr 
wittig and mr 
lake for legal fees and expenses are unreasonable 
these disputes are also the subject of litigation 
we are unable to predict whether the government will retry the criminal charges against mr 
wittig and mr 
lake or the outcome of these matters  including their ultimate impact on our results of operations 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  potential liabilities to david c 
wittig and douglas t 
lake 
coal inventory and delivery coal deliveries from the powder river basin region of wyoming to our coal fired generating stations improved in  however  they continue to be slower than historical averages due primarily to issues at the coal mines and with the rail delivery system 
during and continuing in  we implemented compensating measures based on delivery cycle times  our assumptions about future delivery cycle times  fuel usage and planned inventory levels 
we may continue to use these measures as conditions warrant 
the compensating measures include  but are not limited to reducing coal consumption during certain periods  revising normal operational dispatch of our generating units  purchasing power from others  reducing wholesale sales and leasing additional rail cars 
the effects of additional purchased power expense and the reduction in sales due to slower coal deliveries have been partially offset by higher market based wholesale sales prices 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards for our regulated utility operations that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in utility rates 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific orders from the kcc  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
to the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed to be probable  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 
pension and post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on future costs  which may be reflected as an increase or decrease in net income in the current and future periods  or on the amount of related liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets or may also require cash contributions 
the following table shows the annual impact of a change in our pension plan discount rate  salary scale and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual change in projected benefit obligation annual change in pension liability asset annual change in projected pension expense in thousands discount rate decrease    increase    salary scale decrease    increase    rate of return on plan assets decrease  increase  we recorded pension expense of approximately million in  million in and million in these amounts reflect the pension expense of westar energy and our responsibility for the pension expense of wolf creek 
pension expense increases are due primarily to the amortization of investment losses from prior years that are recognized on a rolling four year average basis and changes in assumptions including lower discount rates  lower returns on assets  increases in salaries and updated mortality tables 
pension expense for is expected to be approximately million 
the following table shows the annual impact of a change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets on our post retirement benefit plans other than pension plans 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual change in projected benefit obligation annual change in post retirement liability asset annual change in projected post retirement expense in thousands discount rate decrease   increase   rate of return on plan assets decrease increase revenue recognition energy sales we record revenue as electricity is delivered 
amounts delivered to individual customers are determined through the systematic monthly readings of customer meters 
at the end of each month  the electric usage from the last meter reading is estimated and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded 
the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors that include fluctuations in energy demands  weather  line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes 
we had estimated unbilled revenue of million as of december  and million as of december  we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the value of contracts in our portfolio as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of contracts for fuel that we purchase to produce energy in our power plants  we include the net mark to market change in sales on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the resulting unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data is available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
prices used to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of fair value of our trading positions 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 
the tables below show the fair value of energy marketing and fuel contracts that were outstanding as of december   their sources and maturity periods 
fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  a a approximately million of the fair value of fuel supply contracts is recognized as a regulatory liability 
the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts as of december  are summarized in the following table 
fair value of contracts at end of period sources of fair value total fair value maturity less than year maturity years in thousands prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on option pricing models options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a options are priced using a series of techniques  such as the black option pricing model 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties 
we record deferred tax assets for capital losses  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when we believe we do not or will not have sufficient future capital gain income or taxable income to realize the benefit of the capital loss  operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  we reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we recognize a valuation allowance if we determine  based on available evidence that it is unlikely that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
we report the effect of a change in the valuation allowance in the current period tax expense 
asset retirement obligations we calculate our asset retirement obligations and related costs using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
we estimate our asset retirement obligations based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time the related long lived asset was either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation become effective 
in determining our asset retirement obligations  we make assumptions regarding probable disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our asset retirement obligations reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  for more detailed information 
operating results we evaluate operating results based on earnings per share 
we have various classifications of sales  defined as follows retail sales of energy made to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other retail sales of energy for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
tariff based wholesale sales of energy to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the rates for which are generally based on cost as prescribed by ferc tariffs 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle 
market based wholesale sales of energy to wholesale customers  the rates for which are generally based on prevailing market prices as allowed by our ferc approved market based tariff  or where not permitted  pricing is based on incremental cost plus a permitted margin 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle 
energy marketing includes i transactions based on market prices with volumes not related to the production of our generating assets or the demand of our retail customers  ii financially settled products and physical transactions sourced outside our control area  and iii changes in valuations for contracts that have yet to settle that may not be recorded in tariff or market based wholesale revenues 
transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on a tariff with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the economy of our service area and competitive forces 
our wholesale sales are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity and transmission availability 
changing weather affects the amount of electricity our customers use 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among our residential customers 
mild weather serves to reduce customer demand 
compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  changes in results of operations are as follows 
year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts sales residential commercial industrial other retail   b total retail sales tariff based wholesale market based wholesale energy marketing transmission a other total sales operating expenses fuel and purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment earnings other income other expense total other income interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations results of discontinued operations  net of tax net income preferred dividends earnings available for common stock basic earnings per share a transmission includes an spp network transmission tariff 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million 
this amount  less approximately million that was retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 
b change greater than the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of megawatt hours mwh of electricity 
no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to the amount of electricity we generate at our generating plants 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total the increase in retail sales reflects the change in rates  including the effect of implementing the reca  and warmer weather 
when measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was warmer than during and approximately warmer than the year average 
the increase in industrial sales was due primarily to additional oil refinery load 
the change in other retail sales reflects the recognition in of revenue subject to refund  of which i million is due to the difference between estimated fuel and purchased power costs billed to our customers and actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred for our westar energy customers  ii million is due to amounts associated with a transmission delivery charge approved by the kcc in its order  iii million collected for property taxes in excess of our actual property taxes obligations  and iv million related to amounts we collected in rates related to terminal net salvage that the kcc s february  order requires us to refund 
the revenue subject to refund was partially offset by our having stopped accruing for rebates to customers in december we made tariff based sales in at an average price that was about higher than the price of these sales in we attribute about million  or  of the increase in tariff based wholesale sales to higher prices reflecting an adjustment for our fuel costs as permitted in ferc tariffs 
our market based wholesale sales and sales volumes decreased in due primarily to our having conserved coal inventories  but the average price per mwh that we received for these sales in was about higher than in the change in fuel and purchased power expense is the result of changing volumes produced and purchased  prevailing market prices and contract provisions that allow for price changes 
we burned about less fuel in our generating plants in  due primarily to our having conserved coal inventories 
we also used less expensive generation 
in addition  during we deferred as a regulatory asset million for the difference between the estimated fuel and purchased power costs that we billed our kge customers and our higher actual fuel and purchased power costs that we are allowed to collect under the terms of the reca 
as a result  our fuel expense was million lower in than in we also experienced a million increase in our purchased power expense due primarily to our having purchased greater volumes than in we experienced an increase in our operating and maintenance expense due primarily to four factors i the amortization of million of previously deferred storm restoration expenses as authorized by the kcc order  ii a million increase in spp network transmission costs  iii a million increase in taxes other than income taxes due primarily to higher property taxes  and iv an increase in maintenance expenses for outages at la cygne and the gordon evans energy center 
these higher expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in the lease expense related to la cygne unit operating and maintenance expense in included a million loss as a result of the decrease in the present value of previously disallowed plant costs associated with the original construction of wolf creek due to the extension of the recovery period 
we experienced an increase in our depreciation and amortization expense of million 
this increase was due primarily to the reduction of depreciation expense of million in due to the establishment of a regulatory asset for the differences between the depreciation rates we used for financial reporting purposes and the depreciation rates authorized by the kcc for the period of august to march provisions of the kcc order allowed us to record this regulatory asset 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to increased employee pension and benefit costs 
partially offsetting these increases were lower legal fees associated with matters having to deal with former management and a decline in insurance costs 
other income increased due primarily to corporate owned life insurance 
we received million in income from corporate owned life insurance in compared to million in associated with our having terminated an accounts receivable sales facility we experienced a million decrease in other expense 
interest expense decreased due primarily to a million reduction in interest expense on long term debt due primarily to a lower long term debt balance and lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing activities discussed in detail in liquidity and capital resources debt financings 
this decline was partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense on short term debt due to increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the decrease in income tax expense is due primarily to the utilization of previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards to offset realized capital gains and increases in non taxable income from corporate owned life insurance 
compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  changes in results of operations are as follows 
year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales tariff based wholesale market based wholesale energy marketing transmission a other total sales operating expenses fuel used for generation purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment earnings loss on extinguishment of debt other income other expense total other income expense interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations results of discontinued operations  net of tax net income preferred dividends earnings available for common stock basic earnings per share a transmission includes an spp network transmission tariff 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million 
this amount  less approximately million that was retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 
the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of megawatt hours mwh of electricity  for the years ended december  and no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to electricity we generate 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total residential and commercial sales and sales volumes increased due primarily to warmer weather during than experienced in when measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was warmer than during and above the year average 
we measure cooling degree days at weather stations we believe to be generally reflective of conditions in our service territory 
the warmer weather also contributed to the increased tariff based wholesale sales and sales volumes 
additionally  about million  or approximately  of the increase in the tariff based wholesale sales was due to the wolf creek outages 
we sold more tariff based wholesale power to kepco in accordance with a contract to supply replacement power when wolf creek is not available 
we had more energy available from jeffrey energy center  which also contributed to the increased tariff based wholesale sales 
higher prevailing fuel prices have caused wholesale market prices to increase  which was the primary reason our market based wholesale sales increased 
market based wholesale sales volumes declined because less energy was available for sale due to the increase in retail and tariff based wholesale sales 
the change in energy marketing was due primarily to having more favorable changes in market valuations in compared to and due to favorable settlements of energy contracts in fuel expense increased due primarily to using more expensive sources of generation because of the lower unit availability of our more economical generating units 
purchased power expense increased due primarily to a increase in volumes purchased during as compared to this was due to the various outages or reduced operating capability at some of our generating units and the availability of economically priced power 
at times  it was more economical to purchase power than to operate our available generating units 
also contributing to the increase in purchased power expense was a higher average cost 
operating and maintenance expense increased due to a number of factors  the largest of which was a million write off of disallowed plant costs pursuant to the kcc order 
in addition  costs of operating and maintaining our distribution system increased million due primarily to higher labor costs and additional maintenance projects 
also causing the operating and maintenance expense to increase was higher taxes other than income tax of million  a million charge to write off plant operating system development costs at wolf creek due to non performance of the vendor developing the system and higher maintenance costs at our generating units of million due to the outages as discussed above in unit availability 
these higher expenses were partially offset by a million decline in expense related to changes in the la cygne unit operating lease as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  leases 
depreciation expense decreased primarily because we established a regulatory asset for the depreciation differences between those used for financial statement purposes and regulatory rate making purposes from august to march pursuant to the december  kcc order  which allowed us to record a reduction in depreciation expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due primarily to reduced legal fees and insurance costs 
increased employee pension and benefit costs partially offset the decrease 
during  we recognized a loss of million in connection with the redemption of some of our senior unsecured notes and a loss of million in connection with the redemption of the western resources capital i cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a 
other income during was higher due primarily to million of income from corporate owned life insurance  which was partially offset by higher interest expense associated with borrowings on corporate owned life insurance 
interest expense decreased during due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates due to the refinancing activities as discussed in detail in liquidity and capital resources below 
the increase in income tax expense reflects the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december  compared to december  total restricted cash decreased due primarily to the return of million of collateral we had previously been required to post related to a capacity and transmission agreement 
in may  moody s investors service upgraded its credit ratings for our debt securities  which met conditions in the agreement that allowed the funds to be released 
our accounts receivable balance increased by million due primarily to our having terminated an accounts receivable sales facility during the year 
this is discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  accounts receivable sales program 
inventories and supplies increased million due primarily to increases in fuel stock 
as a result of our coal conservation efforts and other measures we implemented to improve coal deliveries  we were able to build our coal inventories 
due primarily to lower market valuations on our coal supply contract for lawrence and tecumseh energy centers the fair market value of our net energy marketing contracts decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities  increased to million at december   from million at december  total regulatory assets increased million due primarily to the million increase in deferred employee benefit costs for pension and post retirement benefit obligations recognized pursuant to sfas no 
total regulatory liabilities decreased million due primarily to the change in the market value of the coal supply contract for our lawrence and tecumseh energy centers as noted in the discussion of inventories above 
as of december   we recorded a regulatory liability of million compared with million as of december  to recognize the mark to market value of our coal supply contracts 
this decline was partially offset by a million increase in the nuclear decommissioning regulatory liability as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations  million of revenue subject to refund for amounts collected from the reca and million for amounts collected related to terminal net salvage as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other current assets decreased million due primarily to the manner in which we settled lawsuits discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 
as a result of settling the lawsuits and with our insurance carriers  pending actual cash distributions to the plaintiffs  we had recorded a receivable from our insurer  with an offsetting payable to the plaintiffs 
once payments were made to the plaintiffs  both the receivable and the payable were eliminated 
other assets decreased million due primarily to the elimination of the pension intangible asset of million pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
and million associated with the redemption of guardian international  inc guardian preferred stock 
this decline was offset partially by a million increase associated with assets acquired with the acquisition of the spring creek energy center 
as of december   we had no current maturities of long term debt 
current maturities of long term debt as of december  consisted of the million outstanding aggregate principal amount of kge first mortgage bonds that we repaid in january we increased our borrowings under the westar energy revolving credit facility 
as a result our short term debt increased million 
we used a portion of the borrowings to repay the kge first mortgage bonds that were due in january in addition  we used borrowings under the revolving credit facility to meet our on going operational needs 
other current liabilities decreased million due primarily to the disbursement of the funds for the settlement of lawsuits as discussed above and as detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 
upon rebating million to customers in  in fulfillment of a regulatory settlement  we reduced other current liabilities accordingly 
accrued employee benefits increased million due primarily to the additional pension and post retirement benefit liabilities recorded in pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
for additional information  see notes of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans 
asset retirement obligations decreased million due primarily to the remeasurement of our asset retirement obligation for wolf creek based on its application for a license extension 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
during we implemented sfas no 
r  which guides the accounting for equity based compensation 
this caused us to record changes in temporary equity  paid in capital and unearned compensation 
this is discussed in further detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans accumulated other comprehensive income increased million due primarily to the establishment of a regulatory asset for the pension liabilities that were previously charged to accumulated other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources overview we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund future operations  debt maturities and the payment of dividends from a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity 
our available sources of funds include cash  westar energy s revolving credit facility and access to capital markets 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet these cash requirements include  among others  factors affecting sales described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  conditions in the capital markets and compliance with environmental regulations 
capital resources as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  westar energy has a million revolving credit facility against which million had been borrowed and million of letters of credit have been issued 
this left million available under this facility 
the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
the westar energy mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on  and of the principal amount of  all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 
the kge mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on  or of the principal amount of  all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
westar energy sold approximately million shares of its common stock in for net proceeds of million 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million in  from million in during  we used million to pay federal and state income taxes and made a million contribution to our defined benefit pension trust 
during  we used approximately million for system restoration costs related to the ice storm that affected our service territory in january we received million in tax refunds during cash flows from operating activities increased million to million in  from million in during  we received approximately million more in tax refunds than we did during cash paid for interest was million lower in than in due primarily to our lower debt balances 
cash flows used in from investing activities in general  cash used for investing purposes relates to the growth and improvement of our electric utility business 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in plant on an annual basis 
we spent million in  million in and million in on net additions to utility property  plant and equipment 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of protection one and protection one bonds 
cash flows used in financing activities we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in in  an increase in short term debt was the principal source of cash flows from financing activities 
cash from financing activities was used to retire long term debt and to pay dividends 
in  we received cash primarily from the issuance of long term debt and we used cash primarily to retire long term debt and pay dividends 
financing activities in used million of cash compared to million in in  we received cash from issuances of long term debt and the issuance of common stock  and cash was used for the retirement of long term debt and payment of dividends 
future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect we will need cash mostly for utility construction programs designed to improve facilities providing electric service  for future peaking capacity needs  for construction of new transmission lines and to comply with environmental regulations 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash flow  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility and through the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
if we are required to update emissions controls or take other remedial action as a result of the epa s investigation  the costs could be material 
we may also have to pay fines or penalties or make significant capital or operational expenditures related to the notice of violation we received from the epa in connection with certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center 
in addition  significant capital or operational expenditures may be required in order to comply with future environmental regulations or in connection with future remedial obligations 
the following table does not include any amounts related to these possible expenditures 
we expect that costs related to updating or installing emissions controls will be material 
as discussed above  the ecrr will allow for timely inclusion in rates of the costs of capital expenditures directly tied to environmental improvements required by the clean air act 
we believe that other costs incurred would qualify for recovery through rates

the amended and restated revolving credit facility matures on march  so long as there is no default or event of default under the revolving credit facility  we may elect annually prior to the anniversary date of the facility to extend the term of the credit facility for one year 
this one year extension can be requested twice during the term of the facility  subject to lender participation 
the facility allows westar energy to borrow up to an aggregate amount of million  including letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate amount of million 
we may elect  subject to ferc approval  to increase the aggregate amount of borrowings under the facility to million by increasing the commitment of one or more lenders who have agreed to such increase  or by adding one or more new lenders with the consent of the administrative agent and any letter of credit issuing bank  which will not be unreasonably withheld  so long as there is no default or event of default under the revolving credit facility 
a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million is a default under this facility 
westar energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio not greater than at all times 
available liquidity under the facility is not impacted by a decline in westar energy s credit ratings 
also  the facility does not contain a material adverse effect clause requiring westar energy to represent  prior to each borrowing  that no event resulting in a material adverse effect has occurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging activity we may use derivative financial and physical instruments to economically hedge the price of a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine what the value will be when the agreements are actually settled 
in an effort to mitigate market risk associated with fuel and energy prices  we may use economic hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to price changes 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
market price risks our economic hedging and trading activities involve risks  including commodity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk is the risk that changes in commodity prices may impact the price at which we are able to buy and sell electricity and purchase fuels for our generating units 
we believe we will continue to experience volatility in the prices for these commodities 
interest rate risk represents the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in the future  we may use swaps or other financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
credit risk represents the risk of loss resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
we have exposure to credit risk and counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees and master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
results actually achieved from economic hedging and trading activities could vary materially from intended results and could materially affect our consolidated financial results depending on the success of our credit risk management efforts 
commodity price exposure we may engage in both financial and physical trading to manage our commodity price risk 
we trade electricity  coal  natural gas and oil 
we use a variety of financial instruments  including forward contracts  options and swaps  and we trade energy commodity contracts 
we may also use economic hedging techniques to manage overall fuel expenditures 
we procure physical products under forward agreements and spot market transactions 
we are involved in trading activities to reduce risk from market fluctuations  enhance system reliability and increase profits 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our risk of loss  in the form of increased costs  from market price changes in fuel is mitigated through the reca  which provides for inclusion of most fuel costs in retail rates 
we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
the var model is designed to measure the predicted maximum one day loss at a confidence level 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the use of the var method requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we are also exposed to the risk that we value and mark illiquid prices incorrectly 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments used for both trading and risk management purposes 
the var calculation has been adjusted to remove the impact of fuel contracts due to implementation of the reca in the var amounts for and were as follows 
in thousands high low average we have considered a number of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our energy portfolio 
these risks include credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis differentials and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe are effective in managing overall credit risk 
there can be no assurance that the employment of var  or other risk management tools we employ  will eliminate the possibility of a loss 
we are also exposed to commodity price changes outside of trading activities 
we use derivative contracts for non trading purposes and a mix of various fuel types primarily to reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market and commodity prices 
the wholesale power market is extremely volatile in price and supply 
this volatility impacts our costs of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as permitted in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
the loss of revenues associated with this could be material and adverse to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unscheduled outages at our facilities that use fossil fuels and the nuclear refueling schedule 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
interest rate exposure we have entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 
we had approximately million of variable rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
in addition  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and post retirement obligations and affect investment returns 
security price risk we maintain trust funds  as required by the nrc and kansas state laws  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   these funds were comprised of equity securities  debt securities and cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december  and million as of december  by maintaining a diversified portfolio of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund the decommissioning obligation within acceptable risk tolerances 
however  debt and equity securities in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligation rises 
we actively monitor the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocation in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to equity price market risk is  in part  mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the rates we charge our customers
