the company is exposed to interest rate risk on certain of its short term and long term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions 
at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt  the latter subject to interest rate risk 
the variable rate debt is primarily under our credit facility with an interest rate based on a margin above libor and our short term commercial paper facility 
as a result  interest rate changes impact future earnings and cash flow assuming other factors are constant 
a hypothetical change in our weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding variable rate debt at december  would result in a change in after tax annualized earnings of approximately million

we utilize blanket purchase orders blankets to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers 
requirements under blankets generally do not become firm until a varying number of weeks before our scheduled production 
the purchase obligations shown in the above table represent the value we consider firm 
at december   the company had outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million 
we had no other material commercial commitments 
the company did not have any variable interest entities as of december  and december  other than disclosed in the table above and the previous paragraph  the company had no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results 
revenue recognition we recongnize revenue when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  pricing is determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred according to contract terms 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as well as the customer s payment history 
returns  rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product 
we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates  account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria 
certain distributors are offered a right to return product  subject to contractual limitations 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets or goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment is necessary 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we perform our annual impairment test in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
retirement plans approximately half of our domestic employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the remaining employees covered by defined contribution plans 
most of our foreign employees are covered by government sponsored plans in the countries in which they are employed 
our obligations under our domestic defined benefit plans are determined with the assistance of actuarial firms 
the actuaries make certain assumptions regarding such factors as withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuaries also provide us with information and recommendations from which management makes further assumptions on such factors as the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate on benefit obligations and where applicable  the rate of annual compensation increases 
based upon the assumptions made  the investments made by the plans  overall conditions and movement in financial markets  particularly the stock market and how actual withdrawal rates  life spans of benefit recipients and other factors differ from assumptions  annual expenses and recorded assets or liabilities of these defined benefit plans may change significantly from year to year 
based on our annual review of actuarial assumptions as well as historical rates of return on plan assets and existing long term bond rates  we set the long term rate of return on plan assets at and an average discount rate at for our defined benefit plans as of december  see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note in the financial statements 
further discussion of the company s accounting policies is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective beginning in fiscal we are evaluating the new standard to determine the effect on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for deferred benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas requires that public companies prospectively recognize through accumulated other comprehensive income the overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit plans as an asset or liability beginning in their year end balance sheet 
the company has adopted sfas as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk relating to the company s operations due to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices of purchased raw materials 
we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments such as commodity cash flow hedges and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on certain of its short term and long term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions 
at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt  the latter subject to interest rate risk

as a result  interest rate changes impact future earnings and cash flow assuming other factors are constant 
a hypothetical change in our weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding variable rate debt at december   would result in a change in after tax annualized earnings of approximately million 
the company periodically enters into commodity futures and options hedging transactions to reduce the impact of changing metal and natural gas commodity prices 
contract terms of commodity hedge instruments generally mirror those of the hedged item  providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency hedging contracts to manage our exposure on the transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
in the first half of  we began to enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and are treated as cash flow hedges  with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in each accounting period to the extent the hedges are deemed effective 
at december  we had a balance of million in hedge assets  and million in hedge liabilities  representing the fair value of commodity and foreign currency hedges 
of the hedge assets and hedge liabilities at december   million and million  respectively  relate to commodity hedges with the balance of in hedge assets relating to foreign currency 
at december  we had a million gain  net of tax  in aoci related to hedging activities 
of this amount  million related to foreign currency hedges with the balance of million representing commodity hedges
