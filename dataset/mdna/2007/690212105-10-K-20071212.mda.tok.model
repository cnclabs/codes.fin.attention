the forward looking statements and associated risks may include  relate to or be qualified by other important factors  including  without limitation the impact of competitive products and pricing  market conditions that may affect the costs of raw materials as well as the market for our products  changes in our business environment  including actions of competitors and changes in customer preferences  as well as disruptions to our customers businesses  natural disasters that can impact  among other things  costs of fuel and raw materials  the occurrence of acts of terrorism  such as the events of september   or acts of war  changes in governmental laws and regulations  including income taxes  and other factors discussed in this report 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any forward looking statements 
any of the factors described above or in the risk factors section above could cause our financial results  including our net income or loss or growth in net income or loss to differ materially from prior results  which in turn could  among other things  cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
overview we are a leading value added manufacturer of high quality  prepared frozen food products for branded retail  private label  food service and airline customers 
our product line includes entr es  plated meals  bulk packed meal components  pastas  soups  sauces  poultry  meat and fish specialties  as well as organic and vegetarian offerings 
our extensive research and development efforts  combined with proprietary recipes and flexible manufacturing capabilities  provide customers with a one stop solution for new product ideas  formulations and product manufacturing  as well as precise replication of existing recipes 
our capabilities allow customers to outsource product development  product manufacturing and packaging thereby avoiding significant fixed cost and variable investments in resources and equipment 
our customers include prominent nationally recognized names such as panda restaurant group  inc  jenny craig  inc  american airlines  inc  safeway inc 
and pinnacle foods corporation 
our goal is to be a leading developer and manufacturer of value added food products and provider of custom prepared frozen foods 
we intend to create superior value for our stockholders by continuing to execute our growth and operating strategies  including diversifying and expanding our customer base by focusing on sectors we believe have attractive growth characteristics  such as foodservice and retail  investing in and operating efficient production facilities  providing value added ancillary support services to customers  offering a broad range of products to customers in multiple channels of distribution  and continuing to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions and investments 
during fiscal year  our net revenues increased dramatically year on year due to the addition of two new retail customer lines and larger than expected foodservice sales 
during the same time period  however  the prices for virtually all food related commodities  especially poultry  dairy and cheese  eggs  wheat  corn products and oils rose dramatically  some to historic levels 
wherever reasonably possible  we have locked in annual raw materials purchase prices by contracting volume to cover anticipated sales 
larger than expected sales to several customers during fiscal year  along with higher than anticipated spot commodities pricing  required us to purchase raw materials at higher prices  negatively affecting overall material costs and gross margins 
we are now in the process of negotiating several annual vendor and customer contracts  and we believe margins will improve through reduced purchase prices of raw materials  increased sales prices to customers and a change in mix of customers between retail  foodservice and airlines 
this is in line with our strategy to continue to reduce our reliance on a small number of key accounts and to improve margins 
following the completion of plant no 
 we strategically filled available capacity with business that carried gross margins lower than our historical average 
with our recent growth  we expect to move away from some accounts that do not meet our profit objectives towards higher margin business now available to us 
fiscal years and were week periods  and fiscal year was a week period 
net revenues of million increased for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended october  during fiscal year  increased sales in the retail category offset the decline in airline sales and an expected decline in foodservice sales resulting from a customer s decision to diversify its source of suppliers as described further herein 
we expect fiscal sales growth to be driven primarily by our retail category 
we experienced a increase in net revenues for the fiscal year ended october   to million as compared to the fiscal year ended october  the increase in net revenues during fiscal year was due to growth in our retail and foodservice categories 
gross profit of million declined as a percentage of net revenues during fiscal year to versus in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decline in the profit margin was due to increases in raw materials and commodity costs as well as start up costs related to launching two new product lines 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september   decreased to from in fiscal year and in fiscal year  due primarily to lower gross profit 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year as a result of the increase in sales during fiscal year net income of million decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in fiscal year versus in fiscal year due to lower gross profit  partially offset by reduced interest expense as a result of refinanced debt and lower taxes 
as described under liquidity and capital resources below  during fiscal year we refinanced our existing debt of million 
the new credit facility with guggenheim corporate funding  llc gcf was a million senior secured credit facility with a five year maturity and is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
on march   we executed a second amendment to the senior credit agreement allowing for million of additional financing for capital expenditures 
the facility is now a million senior secured credit facility and is structured as a million non amortizing revolving loan  a million amortizing tranche a term loan and a million non amortizing tranche b term loan 
results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our results of operations from one period to another  present the results for each period  the change in those results from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each period as a percentage of net revenues 
the columns present the following first four data columns in each table show the absolute results for each period presented and results for each period as a percentage of net revenues 
last two columns entitled dollar variance and variance shows the change in results  both in dollars and percentages for fiscal year versus fiscal year these two columns show favorable changes as positives and unfavorable changes as negatives 
for example  when our net revenues increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a negative in both columns

net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  increased million or to million from million for the fiscal year ended october   driven predominately by increases in sales to retail customers  as noted below 
retail net revenues increased million or to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in retail net revenues was due in part to the launch of new private label items in february for safeway inc in addition  the company entered into a new agreement with a major national brand which was announced in january  under the terms of the contract  we anticipated sales of approximately million in calendar revenues to this customer did not meet the contract volume requirements and we expect calendar sales to be approximately million  million less than expected 
we are continuing negotiations with this customer and expect calendar year sales to be at or near the original contracted level 
foodservice net revenues decreased million or to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended october  in january  panda restaurant group  inc panda communicated their intentions to transfer million in annual foodservice production volume from us to another vendor 
the decline in sales was less than expected  as panda s strategy to diversify its sources of supply did not proceed as they had anticipated 
as this transfer was delayed  the decrease in sales to this customer during fiscal year was less than million rather than million as previously announced 
while sales growth was positively affected  our overall gross profit margins on this incremental panda business were reduced 
see gross profit below 
we expect panda will continue with its plan to diversify its suppliers 
we are currently in negotiations with panda for their calendar year requirements 
we have proposed a price increase to reflect material cost increases primarily chicken over the last year 
our competitors are major chicken producers 
at this time there is no certainty as to the outcome of the negotiations and what effect they will have on our calendar business with panda 
we believe retail sales increases will offset any potential foodservice sales losses 
airline net revenues decreased million or to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decline in airline revenues was primarily attributable to the loss of sales to delta airlines subsequent to its bankruptcy filing 
we believe airline meals will continue to be a profitable part of our overall business despite the financial and business challenges facing the airline industry 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  decreased million to million  or of net revenues  from million  or of net revenues  for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in margins was attributable to higher raw materials and commodity costs  start up costs relating to simultaneously launching two new product lines  inefficiencies related to production during our facility expansion  and lower profit margins on panda s products 
as noted above  panda did not transition all of the million of business to alternate suppliers as planned 
panda asked us to increase our production volume after chicken contracts were in place for the fiscal year 
as we were required to purchase non contracted chicken at higher spot market costs  our margins were negatively affected 
we are now in the process of negotiating several annual vendor and customer contracts  and we believe margins will improve through a combination of reduced purchase prices of raw material and or increased sales prices to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased  or to million  or of net revenues  for the fiscal year ended september  from million  or of net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  sg a expenses were driven by higher professional fees of  due to sarbanes oxley requirements   of increased brokerage due to higher retail sales  offset partially by reductions in sales promotional activities and in legal services 
we expect professional fees related to sarbanes oxley implementation to be lower by approximately  in fiscal operating income 
operating income decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in operating income was the result of increases in cost of sales and sg a expenses as noted above 
other expenses 
other expenses decreased million for the fiscal year ended september  to million from million for the fiscal year ended october  other expenses for fiscal year included a pretax debt extinguishment charge of approximately  in connection with the termination of our previous financing arrangements 
interest expense declined million from million to million due to lower interest rates as a result of the refinancing in fiscal year and from the capitalization of interest of  on borrowings used in the construction of new plant capacity and line efficiency projects that occurred in fiscal year income tax provision 
income tax expense was million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended october  the difference was a result of income before taxes decreasing million from million for the fiscal year ended october  to million during the year ended september  the effective tax rates were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september  did not materially differ from the statutory rate 
net income 
net income for the fiscal year ended september  was million  or per basic share and per diluted share as compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october  we currently expect to continue profitable operations primarily through a growing revenues from profitable product lines  increasing our customer base and replacing lower margin accounts  b improving gross margins by increasing prices to customers where appropriate  streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage our manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  and c reducing future interest costs on outstanding debt through permitted pre payments on our debt 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these initiatives 
as discussed in risk factors contained in item a of this report  we may be unable to improve our operating results if we suffer a decline in our manufacturing efficiency  the loss of major customers  declines in air travel  adverse changes in our operating costs or raw materials costs or other adverse changes to our business

net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  increased million to million from million for the fiscal year ended october  retail net revenues increased million to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in retail sales was largely due to a increase in sales to jenny craig  inc and to sales generated by two new customers added in the fiscal year ended october  these sales increases more than offset lost revenues from discontinued product lines and lower sales to some retail customers 
foodservice net revenues increased million to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  due to increased sales to an existing customer  which were partially offset by decreased revenue from the loss of a product for an existing foodservice customer 
airline net revenues decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decline in airline sales was primarily attributable to the decision by american airlines in february to remove meals from the coach cabins of all of its domestic flights and partly attributable to significantly reduced sales to delta airlines subsequent to their bankruptcy filing 
year over year comparisons will reflect the loss of sales to delta airlines through the first quarter of fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended october  increased million to million from million for the fiscal year ended october  the majority of this increase is attributable to net revenues increasing million 
the balance of the increase was the result of improvement in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended october  margin improvement was attributable to better operating leverage resulting from higher sales volume and better pricing of raw materials 
we modified our estimate for recording inventory reserves during the first quarter of fiscal year to apply estimated reserve percentages to aging categories 
the impact of the change in this estimate resulted in a one time increase to cost of sales and decrease in gross profit of approximately  or a decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses decreased  to million  or of net revenues  for the fiscal year ended october  from million  or of net revenues  for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in sg a expenses resulted from a  reduction in professional  legal and consulting fees  a  decline in brokerage and royalty expenses due to reduced club store sales and a reduction of  in corporate expenses 
in addition  bad debt expense was reduced in the current year as no additional allowances were added to the reserve for doubtful accounts as compared to the addition of  in the prior year 
these reductions were partially offset by increases of  in sales promotional activities and increases of  and  in payroll and insurance costs  respectively 
the fact that fiscal year was one week shorter than fiscal year also contributed to the decline in sg a expenses 
as a result of the refinancing described under liquidity and capital resources below  we began to experience savings of  in annual consulting fees that we had been paying to an affiliate of our previous lender 
operating income 
operating income increased million to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in operating income was the result of improvements in sales  gross margins and sg a expenses as noted above 
other expenses 
other expenses decreased  for the fiscal year ended october  to million from million for fiscal year ended october  other expenses for fiscal year included  of loss on disposal of fixed assets 
interest expense declined by from million to million due to the reduction of million in the face amount of debt in the past twelve months through voluntary principal payments and lower interest rates as a result of the refinancing 
a total reduction in annual interest expense of approximately million is anticipated during the first twelve months of our new credit agreement 
these anticipated savings may not be fully realized if there are future increases in market interest rates or if we fail to meet our financial and other covenants under our secured credit facility 
the fiscal year ended october  included a pretax debt extinguishment charge of approximately  in connection with the termination of our previous financing arrangements 
income tax provision 
income tax expense was million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended october  the difference was a result of income before taxes increasing million from million for the fiscal year ended october  to million during the year ended october  the effective tax rates were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended october  did not materially differ from the statutory rate 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended october  was the result of the reversal of the valuation reserve of  that was established in fiscal year during the fiscal year ended october   as a result of improved operating results  we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we reversed  of the previously recorded valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets 
net income 
net income for the fiscal year ended october  was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended october  liquidity and capital resources cash decreased  to million at september  from million at october  our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities and availability under our credit facility described below 
during the fiscal year ended september   our operating activities provided cash of million as compared to cash provided of million during the fiscal year ended october  this was primarily due to a decrease in net income of  a decrease in deferred income taxes of million as a result of the use of our prior years net operating losses and an increase in cash used for working capital needs of million as a result of increased sales 
these were offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of  due to the increase in capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended september   our investing activities  comprised of additions to capital expenditures  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment and marketable securities  resulted in a net use of cash of approximately million  as compared to a net use of cash of approximately million during the fiscal year ended october  the use of cash for additions to property and equipment of million includes routine capital expenditures and expenditures to expand the manufacturing capacity of our entr e plant to accommodate additional opportunities for new business 
the expansion  anticipated to cost approximately million  includes installation of new machinery and systems to meet anticipated growth and improve operating efficiency 
we anticipate the expansion will be completed during the first quarter of fiscal year we are using borrowing availability under our credit facility described below to fund the capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities provided cash of million as compared to a use of cash of million during the fiscal year ended october  cash provided by borrowings under our credit facility and equipment loans were million and  respectively 
we also received  from the exercise of stock options  including the related tax benefit 
these sources of cash were offset by cash used to make principal payments of million on our financing arrangements   on our capital lease obligation and  on equipment loans

initial proceeds from the gcf facility  received may   were used to repay approximately million in existing debt and related fees and expenses in connection with the termination of our former financing arrangements and to pay approximately million in fees and expenses relating to the new financing 
of these fees  million is recorded as debt discount  net of accumulated amortization  on the accompanying balance sheet as of september  we recorded a pretax charge of approximately  in connection with the termination of the former financing arrangements in the third quarter of fiscal year we paid gcf an additional  in fees and expenses on march  related to the second amendment  which was recorded as a debt discount 
the gcf facility contains covenants whereby  among other things  we are required to maintain compliance with agreed levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  leverage targets  annual capital expenditures and incremental indebtedness limits 
mandatory prepayments under the facility are required based on excess cash flow  as defined in the agreement  and upon receipt of proceeds from a disposition or payment from a casualty or condemnation of the collateralized assets  and voluntary prepayments under the facility are generally permitted as provided in the agreement 
the facility also contains customary restrictions on incurring indebtedness and liens  making investments  paying dividends and making loans or advances 
we entered into the following amortizing loans with key bank to finance the purchase of machinery used for manufacturing processes a year loan in the principal amount of  at a fixed interest rate of on september   a year loan in the principal amount of  at a fixed interest rate of on november  and a year loan in the principal amount of  at a fixed interest rate of on january  we amended our existing operating lease agreements with general electric capital corporation on october  the amended lease resulted in a three year capital lease in the principal amount of  at a fixed interest rate of  with a bargain purchase option at the expiration of the lease 
the assets acquired under this capital lease have an acquisition cost of  we believe that funds available to us from operations and existing capital resources will be adequate for our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level category  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact adoption may have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and the measurement of tax benefits recognized 
the provisions of fin will be required to be adopted in the first quarter of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of fin may have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform on going credit evaluations of each customer s financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customer could impact its future ability to satisfy its receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
until fiscal  bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  were immaterial as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for the fiscal years ended september   october  and october   our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from two customers 
panda restaurant group  inc and jenny craig  inc 
accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and approximately and respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended october  receivables related to jenny craig  inc  panda restaurant group  inc 
through its distributors  hj heinz company and safeway inc  accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total accounts receivable balance at september  and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total accounts receivable balance at october  inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation reserve based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a reserve is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in material increases or decreases to the reserve 
property and equipment 
the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to ten years 
leasehold improvements to our plant no 
in vernon  california are amortized over the lesser of the initial lease term plus one lease extension period  initially totaling years  or the estimated useful life of the assets 
other leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of materials purchased and labor expended in betterments and major renewals are capitalized 
costs and related accumulated depreciation of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposals are included in other income expense 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
we evaluate the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
at september   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income at that time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk obligations 
we are subject to interest rate risk on variable interest rate obligations 
a hypothetical increase in average market interest rates would increase by approximately  the annual interest expense on our debt outstanding as of september  we are also subject to interest rate risk on our fixed interest rate obligations 
based upon outstanding amounts of fixed rate obligations as of september   a hypothetical decrease in average market interest rates would increase the fair value of outstanding fixed rate debt by approximately
