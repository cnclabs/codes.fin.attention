overview we are a global chemistry based drug discovery and development company  focused on identifying and developing novel biologically active small molecules with applications primarily in the prescription drug market 
we engage in comprehensive research from lead discovery  optimization and development to commercial manufacturing and conduct cell and non cell based high throughput screening on a variety of biological targets 
we perform research for many of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own internal research and development 
in addition to our contract services  we also conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds to third parties in return for up front and service fees  and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
in october  we licensed the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize potential products from our amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors identified in one of our proprietary research programs to bristol myers squibb company bms 
our proprietary research and development activities previously led to the development  patenting and licensing of a substantially pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  the active ingredient in the non sedating antihistamine fexofenadine hcl marketed by sanofi aventis sa as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our contract service business and million from our royalties on sales of allegra 
we generated million in cash from operations and spent million related to the acquisition of amri hungary 
in addition  we spent million in capital on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to the construction and outfitting of research facilities in singapore and india  the expansion of our manufacturing suites at our rensselaer facility  and the implementation of a company wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
in addition  we paid down million in outstanding principal on our credit facilities 
we recorded net income of million in as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt  carrying a blended interest rate of approximately 
strategy we continue to execute a long term strategy to grow our global platform services business while leveraging our proprietary technologies and capabilities to provide greater value to our customers and further growth for the company 
in  we established operations in singapore and india  enabling us to provide our research and development services in lower cost environments 
in february  we completed the acquisition of comgenex now known as amri hungary  a privately held drug discovery service company in budapest  hungary 
the addition of amri hungary has provided the company with a european base in a european union member state and significantly increased access to the european market  as well as another lower cost environment from which we can provide our services 
we have designed our operating structure and our services to provide our customers with opportunities to reduce overall drug development time and cost and to simultaneously pursue a greater number of drug discovery and development opportunities across a wide range of technologies  geographic locations  and cost structures 
we also continued to transition and expand our clinical supply manufacturing revenue stream at our large scale manufacturing facility  enabling us to seamlessly transfer our customers clinical supply manufacturing projects through the drug discovery and development process from the development of these materials at our smaller scale chemistry laboratories to large scale production for use in advanced stage human trials 
clinical supply manufacturing supplements our large scale facility s legacy services  which include cgmp commercial production  as well as high potency and controlled drug substance manufacturing  and is expected to assist us in recovering lost revenues resulting from the discontinuation of purchases of one of the products that we sold to ge healthcare 
sales of this product totaled million in  which represented of large scale manufacturing revenue for the year ended december  in addition  clinical supply manufacturing presents additional commercial production opportunities  as we seek to enter into comprehensive agreements with our customers that also provide for commercial supply of these materials upon meeting regulatory approval 
we entered into two of these types of agreements during the second quarter of the materials to be produced under these agreements received positive regulatory announcements in october  and the commercial manufacturing of a product under one of these contracts began in the fourth quarter of clinical supply manufacturing represented of our lsm revenue in  compared to in in november  we announced plans to initiate a restructuring of our lsm business segment 
consistent with our continued strategy of realigning this segment toward a greater focus on manufacturing clinical trial materials with strong commercial potential as noted above  the goals of the restructuring plan are to strengthen our competitiveness in this area and reduce operating costs by eliminating overlap in business processes  organization and project process flow  as well as leveraging existing resources and assets 
the restructuring plan called for us to reduce our workforce in this segment by approximately employees or approximately  as well as reduce non essential operating expenses  raw material costs and future capital expenditure activities 
we estimate that total large scale costs will be reduced by million annually as a result of this restructuring 
we are also evaluating opportunities to leverage our large scale cgmp production facilities  including identifying niche products to manufacture such as active pharmaceutical ingredients api for use in generic versions of compounds whose patents have expired or will be expiring  as well as assessing complementary lines of business that support cgmp production 
we continue to advance our proprietary technologies and programs with the goal to generate licensing and other revenue opportunities 
in october  the company announced the selection of a compound from its proprietary oncology research program for advanced preclinical testing  with the goal of submitting an investigational new drug application ind with the us food and drug administration fda in late or early we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  immunosuppresion  bacterial infection and other diseases  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
additionally  we continue to seek comprehensive research and or supply agreements with our customers  incorporating several of our service offerings in a variety of locations and cost structures worldwide  and spanning across the entire pharmaceutical research and development process  including access to our chemical compound and natural product libraries  performance of screening and other lead discovery activities  performance of lead optimization and pre clinical testing  and large scale manufacturing for clinical trials and commercial sale if the product meets regulatory approval 
we believe that the ability to partner with a single provider of pharmaceutical research and development services from discovery through commercial production is of significant benefit to our customers 
through our comprehensive service offerings  we are able to provide customers with a more efficient transition of experimental compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
under these comprehensive agreements  we typically receive a combination of fees for performance and delivery of goods and services  as well as milestone and royalty payments should collaborative efforts lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
we are currently in the process of implementing a company wide enterprise resource planning erp system  which will ultimately result in the management of all components of our business across all locations within one integrated operating system 
we completed the implementation of this system in all us locations in july  and we expect to implement this system in our international locations in we expect the erp to provide increased visibility into the operation and management of our contract services and research and development businesses 
in addition  we expect to realize efficiencies through the consolidated processing of our administrative functions in a uniform manner across all locations 
the trends that began to emerge in chemistry outsourcing during continued in we continued to experience strong demand for our developmental and small scale cgmp manufacturing services  further extending the growth trend that began in the second half of pricing for our services remained extremely competitive  and the trend of sourcing contracted services to lower cost providers continued 
our ability to provide services under a variety of business models and cost structures by incorporating our lower cost international facilities that were established in india and singapore in  as well as amri hungary  which was acquired in february  continued to be well received by our customers 
our global platform helped to drive an increase in worldwide demand for our discovery services 
this trend  which began in the latter portion of and ended a two year period of declining demand for these services  continued through we currently expect the trend of increased worldwide demand for our services to continue in  and we expect to continue to expand our global service platform to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition to continuing to integrate our existing facilities in india  singapore  and hungary into our global service offerings  we initiated construction on a new  square foot r d centre at the shapoorji pallonji biotech park in hyderabad  india in the facility will conduct contract projects in early stage drug discovery research and house a development laboratory  and is expected to be completed in late as discussed in item of this form k  beginning in september  several generic manufacturers began to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us and canadian patents 
the launch of the generic product is considered an at risk launch due to the on going litigation 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra by sanofi aventis in and in turn  the royalties earned by us on those sales 
we continue to forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as the patent infringement litigation progresses 
however  should we or sanofi aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would continue to experience a material decrease in royalty revenues and operating cash flows 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra in  resulting in a year over year decrease in our royalty revenues for the year 
we currently expect allegra royalty revenues to remain flat or decrease slightly from amounts recognized in we expect to experience a decrease in earnings and operating cash flows in the short term as we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
mt 
prospect impairment during the fourth quarter of  we secured a letter of intent related to the potential sale of the mt 
prospect facility for approximately million 
as a result  we recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to reflect the sales price per the letter of intent less estimated selling costs 
we currently anticipate the sale to be completed in the first half of the facility qualified for held for sale treatment in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of at that time  we anticipated the completion of the sale of the facility by june we previously disclosed that if a definitive agreement to sell the facility was not in place as of june   we would reassess the classification of the facility as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
we were not able to secure a definitive agreement to sell the facility as of june  accordingly  and in connection with the preparation of our second quarter results  we reassessed mt 
prospect as a held for sale facility 
as a result of this assessment  we reaffirmed our intention to sell the mt 
prospect facility  and determined that a further write down of the carrying value of the facility was required 
management estimated the fair value based upon its intention to sell the facility within twelve months and comparable real estate transactions in the facility s market area 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended june  to reflect the estimated fair value of the facility less estimated selling costs 
results of operations operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery development small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale commercial manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing  all of which are in compliance with the food and drug administration s fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for each of our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in s dds lsm total dds contract revenue for was million  an increase of million or compared to contract revenue of for the increase in contract revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in discovery services revenue of million or due to the recognition of license fee and fte services revenues resulting from our license and research agreement with bms  strong worldwide demand for discovery services provided through both our us and singapore facilities  and the addition of million in revenue from amri hungary 
in addition  contract revenue from chemical development  small scale gmp manufacturing and analytical services increased by million or as our customers continue to focus on development stage projects and demand for development services provided through our india facility increased 
we expect the growth trends in both discovery services and development and small scale manufacturing services to continue in lsm contract revenue decreased by million  or  to million in compared to in the decrease in contract revenue was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of purchases of one of lsm s products by ge healthcare in the second quarter of sales of this product totaled million in  which represented of lsm revenue  and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  the decrease is largely offset by an increase in demand for clinical supply products for advanced stage human trials as we shift the focus of our large scale manufacturing operations 
clinical supply manufacturing revenues were million in  or of total lsm revenue  compared to million in  or of total lsm revenue 
the decrease is further offset by a million increase in sales of commercial products to customers other than ge due to the timing of customer requirements 
we expect an increase in large scale contract revenue in as we experience continued growth in the area of clinical supply manufacturing for advanced stage human trials and additionally increase our customer base for other commercial products 
dds contract revenue for was million  an increase of compared to contract revenue of million in the increase in contract revenue was due to an increase in demand for development and small scale manufacturing services  as our customers increased their efforts to further develop previously identified compounds and bring them into clinical trials 
the increase in development and small scale manufacturing revenue was partially offset by a decrease in discovery services revenues  as the industry trends of reduced spending and sourcing of these services to lower cost international providers continued in however  upon commencing lower cost international operations in singapore and india  our ability to offer our services under a variety of business models and cost structures was well received by our customers  resulting in an increase in demand for our discovery services both internationally and domestically during the latter portion of in addition  the license and research agreement that we signed with bms in october includes a significant contract research component and also results in the recognition of an million up front payment over a three year research term 
these factors contributed to an year over year increase in discovery services revenue in the fourth quarter of lsm contract revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to in the increase in contract revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for clinical supply products for advanced stage human trials as we shift the focus of our large scale manufacturing operations 
clinical supply manufacturing revenues were million in  or of total lsm revenue  compared to million in  or of total lsm revenue 
our largest lsm customer  ge  discontinued purchases of one of the products that we sell to them in sales of this product totaled million  which represented of lsm revenue  and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  recurring royalties we earned royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi aventis sa for the active ingredient in allegra telfast 
royalties were as follows year ended december  in s recurring royalties decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
recurring royalties decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to the fourth quarter impact of the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine by barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd  which occurred on september  the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows 
we expect to continue to experience a decrease in revenues  earnings  and operating cash flows from historical levels in the short term as we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
we continue to forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as patent infringement litigation progresses 
however  should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would continue to experience a material decrease from historic royalty revenues 
furthermore  an at risk launch of a generic version of allegra d by a generic competitor could result in further decreases in royalty revenues 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue  from which we derive gross profit from contract revenue  consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  chemicals  depreciation and other indirect costs 
cost of contract revenue for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in s dds lsm total dds gross margin lsm gross margin total gross margin dds contract revenue gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in gross margin largely resulted from the increase in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business  including the addition of license fee revenues associated with our licensing and research agreement with bms 
the recognition of license fees contributed approximately million to dds contract revenue for  with no corresponding incremental cost 
we also realized good margin contributions on services performed at amri hungary 
dds contract gross margin was also favorably impacted by a million decrease in the amortization of the company s chemical compound and natural product library inventories for the year ended december   due to the impairment of these libraries in the fourth quarter of this item was offset by increased salary and benefit expenses due to annual merit increases and the recognition of additional share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r 
we expect the trend of increased dds contract revenue gross margins to continue in due to increases in contract revenues both domestically and internationally in relation to the fixed costs at these locations 
lsm contract revenue gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in the decrease is due to the impact of the transition of our large scale manufacturing facility from specializing in the repetitive manufacturing of commercial products to the non repetitive manufacturing of clinical supply compounds for numerous customers for use in clinical trials 
in november we announced a restructuring plan to realign the facility s operations and cost structure with this business model 
the goal of the restructuring plan is to improve the efficiency and profitability of the lsm operating segment by eliminating overlap in business processes  organization and project process flow  as well as leveraging existing resources and assets 
as a result  we expect gross margins in the lsm segment to improve in  as we expect to realize annual savings of approximately million from the restructuring plan beginning in the savings are expected to occur through the announced workforce reductions as well as non workforce related actions such as the disposal of underutilized assets  elimination of non essential operating expenses  and reductions in raw material costs 
dds contract revenue gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in gross margin largely resulted from the increase in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business  as well as decreases in facilities and overhead costs  compensation and benefits expense due to a reduction in scientific personnel  as well as decreases in write downs of our library and raw material inventories 
lsm contract revenue gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in the decline in gross margin was due to the transition of our large scale manufacturing facility from specializing in the manufacturing of commercial products to the manufacturing of clinical supply compounds for use in human trials 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
awards are currently payable primarily to dr 
thomas d ambra  the chief executive officer and president of the company 
the incentive awards were as follows year ended december  in s the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease was directly attributable to the continued decrease in allegra royalties in  partially offset by technology incentive awards paid to employees involved in the development of our proprietary amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors as a result of the successful licensing of this technology to bms 
we expect technology incentive award expense to generally fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease was directly attributable to the decrease in allegra royalties in research and development research and development expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel  costs of chemicals and other out of pocket costs and overhead costs for work performed on proprietary technology research and development projects 
we utilize our expertise in small molecule chemistry  biocatalysis and natural products to perform our internal research and development projects 
the goal of these programs is to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  research and development is performed at our rensselaer  ny facility related to the improvement of production processes as well as research related to the potential manufacture of new products 
research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in s research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in r d expense during the year ended december  is due primarily to the out licensing of our cns programs  which represented our most significant investment in r d in  to bms in october as a result  after signing the agreement in october  we did not incur significant r d expenditures that would have been necessary to further advance these programs 
in addition  certain costs associated with these programs  primarily consisting of compensation  employee benefit  and overhead costs related to the amri scientific personnel working on these programs have been allocated to cost of contract revenue related to the contract research we are performing for bms in conjunction with the licensing and research agreement 
on october   the company announced the selection of a compound from its proprietary oncology research program for advanced preclinical testing  with the goal of submitting an investigational new drug application ind with the us food and drug administration fda in late or early we currently expect research and development expense increases in as we advance our oncology compound towards an ind submission with the fda 
projecting expected project completion dates and anticipated revenue from our internal research programs is not practical at this time due to the early stages of the projects and the inherent risks related to the development of new drugs 
our internal central nervous system program  which was our most advanced project to date  was licensed to bms in exchange for up front license fees  contracted research services  and the rights to future milestone and royalty payments 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  immunosuppresion and inflammation  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in research and development expenses was due to the fact that research and development expenses for the year ended december  included a million charge related to the issuance of warrants to bms in conjunction with our acquisition of intellectual property related to our central nervous system cns programs 
the decrease was also due to the fact that we licensed our cns programs  which represented our most significant investment in r d in both and  to bms in october as a result  after signing the agreement in october  we did not incur significant r d expenditures that would have been necessary to further advance these programs 
in addition  certain costs associated with these programs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefit costs related to the amri scientific personnel working on these programs  shifted to cost of contract revenue related to the contract research we are performing for bms in conjunction with the licensing and research agreement 
finally  the decrease was also due to initiatives we undertook to reorganize our internal departments in order to have a more formalized and structured r d business group in  resulting in a more narrow focus of the scope of our research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and costs related to facilities and information services 
selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows year ended december  in s the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to the addition of million in incremental administrative costs incurred at amri hungary  an increase in salaries and benefits expense of million due to the addition of administrative and business development personnel and the recognition of additional share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r  as well as an increase in costs of million due to the implementation and maintenance of our erp system 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million from a refund of property taxes at our mt 
prospect facility and an incremental decrease of million in our singapore expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in due to increased business development personnel costs  the recognition of additional stock based compensation costs  additional travel costs associated with our international operations  and additional recruiting costs associated with the staffing of scientific personnel at both our domestic and international operations resulting from the anticipated increased demand for our contract services 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was due to an increase in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from the addition of administrative and business development personnel  as well as the reallocation of certain personnel expenses to more appropriately reflect the current use of these resources  the addition of million in start up and administrative costs associated with our singapore and india operations  and a million increase in facilities costs associated with the reallocation of these costs to more appropriately reflect the current cost of operating our laboratory and administrative facilities 
these increases were partially offset by million of employee and equipment relocation costs associated with the closure of our mount prospect facility incurred during  as well as a decrease in professional fees of million due to an overall decrease in sarbanes oxley compliance service costs and additional accounting and valuation service fees associated with the impairment analyses performed at our bothell and mount prospect facilities in impairment and restructuring charges large scale manufacturing restructuring on november   the company announced plans to initiate a restructuring of the company s lsm business segment 
consistent with the company s continued strategy of realigning its lsm segment toward a greater focus on manufacturing clinical trial materials with strong commercial potential  the goals of the restructuring plan are to strengthen the company s competitiveness in this area and reduce operating costs by eliminating overlap in business processes  organization and project process flow  as well as leveraging existing resources and assets 
the restructuring plan called for the company to reduce its workforce in this segment by approximately employees or approximately  as well as reduce non essential operating expenses  raw material costs and future capital expenditure activities 
the company has estimated that total large scale costs will be reduced by million annually as a result of this restructuring 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  including a non cash asset disposal charge of approximately million  and cash charges of approximately million consisting primarily of termination benefits 
the large scale restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring charge in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  and the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the following table displays the restructuring activity and liability balances balance at january  restructuring charges incurred amounts balance at december  in s termination benefits asset disposal costs total costs of termination benefits relate to severance packages  outplacement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring 
asset disposal costs relate primarily to the carrying value of underutilized assets that were identified for disposal in conjunction with the restructuring plan 
the large scale manufacturing restructuring activity was recorded in the lsm operating segment 
the net cash outflow related to the large scale manufacturing restructuring for the year ended december  was million 
anticipated cash outflows related to the large scale manufacturing restructuring for are million  which primarily consists of the payment of accrued termination benefits 
mt 
prospect restructuring and impairment charges during the fourth quarter of  we secured a letter of intent related to the potential sale of the facility for approximately million 
as a result  we recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to reflect the sales price per the letter of intent less estimated selling costs 
we previously recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended june  to reflect the estimated fair value of the facility less estimated selling costs 
as of june  we completed an in depth review of the carrying value of all of our natural product and chemical compound library inventories 
as a result of this review  which was based on expected future revenues  it was determined that a significant write down in the carrying value of library inventories was required 
the reduction in the carrying value of the library inventories reflected less favorable market conditions than previously projected 
the write down of library inventories triggered an assessment of the recoverability of certain other related long lived assets and goodwill within the bothell reporting unit  including the goodwill and intangibles which resulted from the acquisition of new chemical entities nce  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

based on our review  we determined that an impairment of certain related goodwill and long lived assets had occurred 
in addition  we initiated a restructuring which resulted in the closure of our mt 
prospect research center and the consolidation of mt 
prospect s operations in our new york facilities 
the restructuring triggered an assessment of the carrying value of the mt 
prospect research center property and equipment and related goodwill 
based on this review  and in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we determined that an impairment of certain related goodwill and property and equipment had occurred 
further  we incurred restructuring costs related to the mt 
prospect restructuring 
we previously disclosed that if a definitive agreement to sell the facility was not in place as of june   it would reassess the classification of the facility as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
at that time 
we were not able to secure a definitive agreement to sell the facility as of june  accordingly  and in connection with the preparation of its second quarter results  the company reassessed mt 
prospect as a held for sale facility 
as a result of this assessment  the company reaffirmed its intention to sell the mt 
prospect facility  and determined that a further write down of the carrying value of the facility was required 
management estimated the fair value based upon its intention to sell the facility within twelve months and comparable real estate transactions in the facility s market area 
the restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring charge in the consolidated statement of loss for the year ended december  the subsequent impairment of the mt 
prospect facility and the resulting adjustments to the related restructuring liabilities are included under the caption property and equipment impairment in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets at december  and the following table displays the restructuring activity and liability balances balance at january  adjustments payments balance at december  in s asset disposal costs total asset disposal costs relate primarily to brokerage commissions  legal fees  and marketing expenses associated with the planned sale of the mount prospect research center facility  which is included in property and equipment held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company also incurred million in employee and equipment relocation costs during these relocation costs are included under the caption selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statement of loss 
the mt 
prospect restructuring activity was recorded in the dds operating segment 
the net cash outflow related to the mt 
prospect restructuring for the year ended december  was anticipated cash outflows related to the large scale manufacturing restructuring for are million  which primarily consists of the payment of accrued asset disposal costs 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates represented the company s proportionate share in the income or loss of investees that the company accounts for under the equity method 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates was as follows year ended december  in s the loss recorded in reduced the value of the company s investment to  and as such  no further adjustments will be recorded until the investee returns to a position of positive net worth 
interest income expense  net year ended december  in thousands interest expense interest income interest income expense  net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to the paydown of the million outstanding balance on the company s line of credit in the third quarter of interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was due to increases in the rates paid on the company s variable rate debt that were not hedged by its interest rate swaps  partially offset by the paydown of the million outstanding balance on the company s line of credit in the third quarter of interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase was due to increases in the rates earned on investment securities  interest bearing cash accounts and other short term cash equivalents  partially offset by decreases in the underlying interest earning balances held by the company 
interest income increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in interest income was primarily due to increases in the rates earned on short term cash equivalents and investment securities  as well as an effort by management to maximize balances held in short term cash equivalent accounts  which are higher yielding than interest bearing cash accounts 
loss on equity investment we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
during  we made equity investments in two private companies totaling million 
under the terms of these agreements  we provided fte services to each customer in exchange for equity securities  plus additional fee for service cash payments 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  one of our investees attempted to raise additional financing in order to fund its operations  but was unable to secure such financing on acceptable terms 
as such  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our investment based on an analysis of the investee s current financial condition  its prospects of generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this analysis it was our judgment that an other than temporary impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was zero  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
we determined that no impairment was required for our remaining  equity investment based on our analysis as of december  and however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
income tax expense year ended december  in s income tax expense decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the overall decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in pre tax income 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to of pre tax income for the year ended december  from of pre tax income for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the consistency of the company s deductible items and non taxable earnings and a decrease in the pre tax income  as well as the benefit recognized from tax holidays that the company has been granted on earnings from certain foreign operations 
we expect the effective tax rate to approximate of pre tax income for income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the overall increase in income tax expense was attributable to an increase in income before income tax expense  even though income tax expense for reflects the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges as non deductible tax items 
the fluctuation in the effective rate resulted primarily from the impact the revised projected annual results had in relationship to the projected annual permanent differences 
our effective tax rate was consistent with the company s historical experience excluding the impact of the impairment charges 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
during  we generated cash of million from operating activities 
the primary sources of operating cash flows were payments received for the performance of contract services and royalty payments received from sanofi aventis based upon a percentage of sales of allegra 
the primary uses of operating cash flows are the payment of compensation and benefits to both scientific and administrative personnel  purchases of inventory and supplies  and payment of occupancy costs 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our operating cash flows 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers have filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
on september   barr pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
announced that they had entered into an agreement for the launch of fexofenadine hydrochloride mg  mg and mg tablets  the generic version of allegra tablets in the united states 
the launch of the generic product is considered an at risk launch due to the on going litigation 
the at risk launch of generic fexofenadine has had a material adverse impact on us sales of allegra by sanofi aventis and in turn  the royalties earned by us on those sales 
on september   we  along with aventis pharmaceuticals  filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the us district court in new jersey seeking to enjoin barr pharmaceuticals  inc  teva pharmaceuticals ltd  ranbaxy laboratories  ltd 
and amino chemicals  ltd 
from the sale of generic versions of allegra in the united states 
on january   the us district court denied our request for a preliminary injunction 
an appeal of that decision was taken to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit and  on november   the appellate court affirmed the district court s denial of a preliminary injunction 
the federal circuit s decisions on the preliminary injunction application is not dispositive of the merits of the claims being asserted as described above 
subsequent to the preliminary injunction proceeding in the district court  dr 
reddy s laboratories has engaged in an at risk launch of generic fexofenadine products 
should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would continue to experience a material decrease in royalty revenues and operating cash flows 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  primarily resulting from million for the acquisition of property and equipment  and million related to the acquisition of comgenex  offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities net of purchases of these securities of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting of million in long term debt repayments  offset by million provided by proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchase plan withholdings 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million at december  the primary sources of the decrease were the use of cash and investments to fund capital expenditures and the acquisition of amri hungary  and a decrease in the carrying value of our held for sale mt 
prospect facility 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue due primarily to the recognition of deferred up front licensing fees received in conjunction with our licensing and research agreement with bms as well as the completion of the revenue recognition process on several fixed fee contracts  and an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of invoicing and collecting on sales to customers 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the construction of our research facilities in singapore and india  development of an enterprise resource planning erp system and expansion and modification of our large scale manufacturing facilities 
for  we expect to incur million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the continued outfitting of our research facilities in singapore and hungary  the completion of a  square foot research centre in india  the implementation of our erp system at our international locations  and the addition or replacement  as appropriate  of equipment for our domestic discovery  development  small scale manufacturing  and large scale manufacturing services 
we entered into a credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million line of credit to fund the acquisition of organichem during the term loan matures in february  as of december   the interest rate on million of the outstanding term loan balance was and the interest rate on the remaining million was 
on june   the company amended the credit facility to extend the maturity date on the line of credit from february  to june  the line of credit bears interest at a variable rate based on the company s leverage ratio 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the line of credit was the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum required operating cash flow coverage ratio  a minimum earnings before interest and taxes to interest ratio and a minimum current ratio 
other covenants include limits on asset disposals and the payment of dividends 
as of december  and we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million at december  the decrease of million resulted from a million increase in income taxes payable due to the timing of income tax payments and the generation of additional taxable income in in addition  there was a decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  which primarily resulted from the pay down of outstanding balances on our line of credit of million and capital expenditures of million 
these decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations of million  which includes the receipt of an million up front license fee from bms in conjunction with a license and research agreement signed in october the up front fee was included in deferred revenue and will be recognized over the initial three year term of the agreement 
finally  there was a decrease in royalty receivables of million due to reduced royalties on sales of allegra telfast resulting from the at risk launch of generic fexonfenadine in the fourth quarter of these decreases are partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased contract revenues and the timing of payments received from our customers 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the expansion and modification of our large scale manufacturing facilities  the construction of our research facilities in singapore and india  and initial development of an erp system 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  primarily resulting from million for the acquisition of property and equipment  and purchases of investment securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of these securities of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting of million in long term debt repayments  offset by million provided by proceeds from stock option and stock purchase plan exercises 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
furthermore  a continued significant decrease in royalties from allegra would negatively affect our cash flow from operations and financial condition in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques that we believe have or reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  unbilled revenue  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefit plans  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract revenue recognition our contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers and reimbursed expenses under such contracts 
we also seek to include provisions in certain contracts which contain a combination of up front licensing fees  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology and expertise lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
reimbursed expenses consist of chemicals and other project specific costs 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one year s prior notice  depending on the size of the contract 
we analyze our agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and sab  revenue recognition 
allocation of revenue to individual elements which qualify for separate accounting is based on the estimated fair value of the respective elements 
we generate contract revenue on the following basis full timeequivalent fte 
an fte agreement establishes the number of our employees contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the price per fte  plus an allowance for chemicals and other project specific costs  which may or may not be incorporated in the fte rate 
fte contracts can run in one month increments  but typically have terms of six months or longer 
our fte contracts typically provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
these contracts involve our scientists providing services on a best efforts basis in a project which involve a research component with a timeframe or outcome that has some level of unpredictability 
there are no fixed deliverables that must be met for payment as part of these services 
as such  we recognize revenue under fte contracts on a monthly basis as services are performed according to the terms of the contract 
time and materials 
under a time and materials contract we charge our customers an hourly rate plus reimbursement for chemicals and other project specific costs 
we recognize revenue for time and material contracts based on the number of hours devoted to the project multiplied by the customer s billing rate plus other project specific costs incurred 
fixed fee 
under a fixed fee contract we charge a fixed agreed upon amount for a deliverable 
fixed fee contracts have fixed deliverables upon completion of the project 
typically  we recognize revenue for fixed fee contracts after projects are completed  delivery is made and title transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  our customers request that we retain materials produced upon completion of the project due to the fact that the customer does not have a qualified facility to store those materials 
in these instances  the revenue recognition process is considered complete when necessary project documentation batch records  certificates of analysis  etc 
has been delivered to the customer and payment has been collected 
up front license fees milestone and royalty revenue 
we recognize revenue from up front non refundable licensing fees on a straight line basis over the period of the underlying project 
we will recognize revenue arising from a substantive milestone payment upon the successful achievement of the event  and the resolution of any uncertainties or contingencies regarding potential collection of the related payment  or if appropriate over the remaining term of the agreement 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue represents monies received for services that have not yet been performed as well as customer billings related to completed production which has not yet shipped 
as an added service  during we began to temporarily store completed cgmp production at our facilities for certain customers 
under these arrangements  upon completion of the customer project we typically will enter into a storage agreement with the customer 
we will temporarily store and subsequently ship the completed production  often in multiple shipments to multiple sites 
the revenue related to these arrangements is typically recognized at the time the products are ultimately shipped  however  in certain instances  the revenue recognition process is considered complete when necessary project documentation batch records  certificates of analysis  etc 
has been delivered to the customer and payment has been collected  as noted above 
recurring royalty revenue recognition 
recurring royalties consist of royalties under a license agreement with sanofi aventis based on the worldwide sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
we record royalty revenue in the period in which the sales of allegra telfast occur 
royalty payments from sanofi aventis are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales of allegra telfast in that quarter 
restructuring charges we account for our restructuring costs as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet certain requirements 
inventory inventory consists primarily of commercially available fine chemicals used as raw materials in the research and production process  work in process and finished goods at our large scale manufacturing location and chemical compounds in the form of natural product and novel compound collections 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market 
we record reserves for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  which could result in a charge to operations 
goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment or on an interim basis if certain triggering events occur 
a determination of impairment is made based upon the estimated discounted future cash flows of the operations associated with the related reporting unit  comparable company multiples and recent transactions involving similar entities 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future we would be required to record a charge to our results of operations 
factors the company considers important which could result in an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
total goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  was million  including million associated with the company s acquisition of organichem corporation and million of goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of comgenex kutato fejleszto rt 
long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  the following a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in the market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recorded 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds their fair value and will reduce only the carrying amounts of the long lived assets 
we utilize the assistance of an independent valuation firm in determining the fair values 
equity investments we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting for investments as our ownership interest in each customer is below and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entities 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance  such as changes in market conditions  poor operating results of the underlying investments  or the inability of the entities to obtain additional financing indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
total equity investments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  were million 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we maintain pension and postretirement costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and trends in health care costs  which are updated on an annual basis 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an employer that sponsors one or more defined benefit pension plans or other postretirement plans to recognize the funded status of a plan  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation  in the balance sheet  recognize in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not yet recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end balance sheet  and disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition asset or obligation 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective december  allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to absorb estimated receivable losses as circumstances arise that bring into doubt our ability to fully collect on outstanding receivable balances 
the allowance and related accounts receivable are reduced when the account is deemed uncollectible 
environmental liabilities in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  and has made provisions for the estimated financial impact of environmental cleanup related costs 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation  preliminary findings and the length of time involved in the remediation or settlement 
the company accrues environmental cleanup related costs when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which amends sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in establishing standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  as well as transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the share based payment 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
as allowed under sfas no 
r  the company elected the modified prospective method of adoption  under which compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
prior to january   the company applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
in accounting for its fixed plan stock options 
as such  compensation expense was recorded only if  on the date of grant  the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
any compensation expense was to be recognized over the vesting period 
compensation cost is based on the fair value of the options on their grant date  and is recognized over the period of requisite service 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including expected volatility in the company s common share price  risk free interest rates  and the expected lives of the options granted  and are updated for each option grant 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including interest rates and the market for the company s common stock  as well as historical data regarding option exercises and forfeitures in making these assumptions 
changes in the related compensation costs associated with future grants may occur due to changes in the assumptions 
effective december   pursuant to and in accordance with the recommendation of the compensation committee the committee of the board of directors  the board of directors of the company approved full acceleration of the vesting of each otherwise unvested stock option that had an exercise price of or greater granted under the company s stock option and incentive plan the plan that was held by employees  officers  and non employee directors 
these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of the company s common stock  based on the closing price of per share on december  ie  such options were underwater 
options to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock  including approximately  options held by executive officers  were subject to this acceleration 
the committee also required that  as a condition to the acceleration of vesting  each executive officer and each non employee director agree to refrain from selling shares of the company s common stock acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and satisfy withholding taxes until the date on which the exercise of such options would have been permitted under the option s pre acceleration vesting terms or  if earlier  the officer s or director s last day of employment or upon a change in control as defined in the plan 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these underwater options was made primarily to minimize certain future compensation expenses that the company would otherwise recognize in its consolidated statements of income loss with respect to these options pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the company also believes that the acceleration may have a positive effect on employee morale  retention and the perception of option value 
the acceleration had no effect on reported net income for the year ended december   and an approximate million  net of tax  impact on pro forma net income in the fourth quarter of income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the taxable income in the two previous tax years to which tax loss carryback can be applied 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in the carryback period and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when considered necessary

 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  however  it does not require any new fair value measurements 
the statement applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by existing standards except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
its applicability is also limited by the practicability exceptions to applying fair value currently found in some standards 
the statement imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be applied to fair value measurements and disclosures in the company s condensed consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of the company is currently assessing the impact of applying this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in these rates as discussed below 
the company has research facilities in singapore  india and hungary and therefore is subject to foreign currency risk 
this risk is composed of both potential losses from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions 
the total net assets of non us operations denominated in non functional currencies subject to potential loss amount to approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million 
furthermore  related to foreign currency transactions  the company has exposure to non functional currency balances totaling approximately million 
this amount includes  on an absolute basis  exposures to foreign currency assets and liabilities 
on a net basis  the company had approximately million of foreign currency liabilities as of december  as currency rates change  these non functional currency balances are revalued  and the corresponding adjustment is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
a hypothetical change of in currency rates could result in an adjustment to the consolidated statement of income of approximately  with respect to interest rates  the risk is composed of changes in future cash flows due to changes in interest rates on our variable rate million term loan and million industrial development authority bonds 
to mitigate this risk  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that have fixed the interest rate on of our variable rate debt 
included in other assets is approximately  which represents the estimated market value of the swap agreements 
the potential loss in cash flows from a adverse change in quoted interest rates would approximate
