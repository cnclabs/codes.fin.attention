overview stereotaxis designs  manufactures and markets an advanced cardiology instrument control system for use in a hospital s interventional surgical suite to enhance the treatment of arrhythmias and coronary artery disease 
the stereotaxis system is designed to enable physicians to complete more complex interventional procedures by providing image guided delivery of catheters and guidewires through the blood vessels and chambers of the heart to treatment sites 
this is achieved using externally applied magnetic fields that govern the motion of the working tip of the catheter or guidewire  resulting in improved navigation  efficient procedures and reduced x ray exposure 
the core components of the stereotaxis system have received regulatory clearance in the us  canada and europe 
we believe that our system represents a revolutionary technology in the interventional surgical suite  or cath lab  and has the potential to become the standard of care for a broad range of complex cardiology procedures 
we also believe that our system is the only technology to be commercialized that allows remote  computerized control of catheters and guidewires directly at their working tip 
we also believe that our technology represents an important advance in the ongoing trend toward digital instrumentation in the cath lab and provides substantial  clinically important improvements and cost efficiencies over manual interventional methods  which require years of physician training and often result in long and unpredictable procedure times and sub optimal therapeutic outcomes 
from our inception in june through  our principal activities were obtaining capital  business development  performing research and development activities  funding prototype development  funding clinical trials and funding collaborations to integrate our products with other interventional technologies 
accordingly  we were classified as a development stage company for accounting purposes through december  our initial focus was on the development of neurosurgical applications for our technology  including delivery of devices to specific sites within the brain 
during that time  we primarily devoted our resources to developing prototypes and performing research and development activities in this area 
following receipt of fda approval to begin human clinical trials in the field of brain biopsies  we successfully completed our initial human clinical procedures in this area in late over the next two years  we shifted our primary focus to developing applications for our technology to treat cardiovascular diseases because of the significantly larger market opportunities for these applications 
during  following receipt of marketing clearance from the fda for our current system  we emerged from the development stage and began to generate revenue from the placement of investigational systems and the commercial launch of our cardiology system in the us and europe 
in august  we completed an initial public offering in which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share 
in september  the underwriters exercised an option to purchase  additional shares 
in connection with the initial public offering including the over allotment option exercise  we received approximately million in net proceeds 
in february  we completed an underwritten take down of our common stock from our shelf registration in which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share including the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase an additional  shares 
in conjunction with the february shelf take down  we received approximately million in net proceeds 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional losses into as we continue the development and commercialization of our products  conduct our research and development activities and advance new products into clinical development from our existing research programs and fund our sales and marketing initiatives 
we believe that by the end of we will be positioned to achieve break even operating performance 
we have alliances with each of siemens ag medical solutions  philips medical systems and biosense webster  inc  through which we integrate our stereotaxis system with market leading digital imaging and d catheter location sensing technology  as well as disposable interventional devices  in order to continue to develop new solutions in the cath lab 
each of these alliances provides for coordination of our sales and marketing activities with those of our partners 
in addition  siemens has agreed to provide worldwide service for our integrated systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total revenue to each deliverable based on its relative fair value in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and recognize revenue for each separate element as the above criteria are met 
when installation is a required part of our contractual obligation to a customer but not considered a separate element  we recognize revenue from system sales upon installation  provided there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the determination of acceptance is made by our employees based on criteria set forth in the terms of the sale 
revenue from system sales where installation is the responsibility of the customer is recognized upon shipment since these arrangements do not include an installation element or right of return privileges 
if uncertainties exist regarding collectability  we recognize revenue when those uncertainties are resolved 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
amounts due beyond months are reflected as long term receivables in the balance sheet 
revenue from services is derived primarily from the sale of annual product maintenance plans 
revenue from services and license fees  whether sold individually or as a separable unit of accounting in a multi element arrangement  is deferred and amortized over the service or license fee period  which is typically one year 
we recognize revenue from disposable device sales or accessories upon shipment and establish an appropriate reserve for returns 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method to account for its grants of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted shares and share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
prior to january   we accounted for those plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for stock based employee compensation as permitted by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option and stock appreciation rights grants made to employees  directors and consultants at the fair value of the option granted  from grants of restricted shares to employees and from share purchases by employees under our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted was determined using the black scholes valuation method which gives consideration to the estimated value of the underlying stock at the date of grant  the exercise price of the option  the expected dividend yield and volatility of the underlying stock  the expected life of the option and the corresponding risk free interest rate 
when we were a private company  the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock was determined by management and the board of directors based on their best estimates using information from preferred stock financing transactions or other significant changes in the business 
the fair value of the grants of restricted shares  all of which were granted after we became a public company  was determined based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
stock compensation expense for options  stock appreciation rights and for time based restricted share grants is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying issue  generally over four years except for grants to directors which generally vest over one to two years 
stock compensation expense for performance based restricted shares is amortized on a straight line basis over the anticipated vesting period and is subject to adjustment based on the actual achievement of objectives 
compensation expenses related to option grants to non employees is periodically remeasured through the vesting date 
compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest  with forfeitures estimated based on our historical experience and future expectations 
the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may increase if we make additional grants of options  stock appreciation rights or restricted shares or if employees continue to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan or if we determine that actual forfeiture rates are less than anticipated 
the amount of expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if we do not achieve the performance objectives by which certain restricted shares are contingent  if the requisite service periods are not completed or if the actual forfeiture rates are greater than anticipated 
additional detail regarding the adoption of sfas r may be found in the notes to the financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report or form k 
investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our investment securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
realized gains or losses  calculated based on the specific identification method  were not material for the periods presented 
interest on securities classified as available for sale is included in interest income 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or its current estimated market value 
we periodically review our physical inventory for obsolete items and provide a reserve upon identification of potential obsolete items 
intangible assets intangible assets are comprised of purchased technology with a finite life 
the acquisition cost of purchased technology is capitalized and amortized over its useful life in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review the assigned useful life on an on going basis for consistency with the period over which cash flows are expected to be generated from the asset and consider the potential for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the process of estimating useful lives and evaluating potential impairment is subjective and requires management to exercise judgment in making assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax assets because we are not able to conclude  due to our history of operating losses  that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize any portion of the deferred tax assets 
in assessing whether and to what extent deferred tax assets are realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable losses  limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code and projections for future losses over periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we determined that a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets was appropriate

interest income increased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  interest income increased due to higher realized rates on investments during the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense remained relatively unchanged as the decrease in average borrowings was offset by amortization of warrant expense related to the affiliate line of credit 
income taxes realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by valuation allowances as of december   and to reflect these uncertainties 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million of which approximately million will expire between and and approximately million will expire between and as of december   we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million of which approximately  will expire between and and million will expire between and  if not utilized 
we may not be able to utilize certain of these loss carryforwards and credits prior to their expiration 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations almost entirely from the private sale of equity securities  totaling approximately million net of offering expenses 
to a much lesser extent  we also financed our operations through working capital and equipment financing loans 
we raised funds from these sources because  as a developing company  we were not able to fund our activities solely from the cash provided by our operations 
in august  we completed an initial public offering in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock 
in september  the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares 
in connection with the initial public offering and over allotment exercise  we received approximately million in net proceeds 
in february  we completed an underwritten take down of our common stock from our shelf registration in which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share including the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase an additional  shares 
in conjunction with the february shelf take down  we received approximately million in net proceeds 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
at december   we had working capital of approximately million  compared to million at december  in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities  including debt  preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
the shelf registration was declared effective by the sec in september we have not sold any securities pursuant to this shelf registration 
liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  as well as short term investments 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we maintained million and million of investments in corporate debt securities  us government agency notes and commercial paper at december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our cash flow by operating  investing and financing activities for each of years ended december   and in thousands caption 
del cash flow used in operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities    cash flow provided by financing activities del 
net cash used in operating activities 
we used approximately million  million and million of cash in operating activities during the year ended december   and  respectively  primarily as a result of operating losses during these periods 
cash generated from working capital purposes increased to  during the year ended december  from  generated during the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in general liabilities  a decrease in prepaid expenses related to certain development projects  an increase in deferred revenue related to systems on which revenue has not yet been recognized and for service and license fees not yet recognized and a decrease in inventory levels offset by an increase in accounts receivable from increased sales in the fourth quarter of net cash provided by used in investing activities 
we used approximately million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december  principally for the purchase or sale of investments  compared to million provided by investing activities during the year ended december  in  we generated million in cash from the purchase and sale of investments 
we used million in each of and for the purchase of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities of million during the year ended december  included purchases of property and equipment of approximately million  with the balance used for the purchase of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities 
we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  principally from the public offering of our common stock in which we realized approximately million in net proceeds 
we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  including million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt from our equipment and revolving credit facilities  net of repayments and million from the issuance of stock as a result of exercises of warrants and options 
we received approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december   primarily as a result of the completion of our initial public offering and exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option in august and september and the sale of our series e preferred stock and related common stock warrants in january and february we also realized million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt from our equipment loan and repaid approximately million of equipment loans and revolving credit facility during as of december   we had outstanding balances under various equipment loan agreements  consisting of an aggregate of  as of december   we had million outstanding under our working capital line of credit and had borrowing capacity of million  subject to collateralization by qualifying receivables and inventory balances 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreements include customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
for example  we are restricted from incurring additional debt  disposing of or pledging our assets  entering into merger or acquisition agreements  making certain investments  allowing fundamental changes to our business  ownership  management or business locations  and from making certain payments in respect of stock or other ownership interests  such as dividends and stock repurchases 
under our loan arrangements  we are required to maintain a ratio of quick assets cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and short term investments to current liabilities minus deferred revenue of at least to we are also required under the credit agreements to maintain our primary operating account and the majority of our cash and investment balances in accounts with the lender 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants of this agreement 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations through throughout  we expect to continue the development and commercialization of our products  the continuation of our research and development programs and the advancement of new products into clinical development 
we expect that our research and development expenditures will continue to increase in and our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in order to support our product commercialization efforts 
until we can generate significant cash flow from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our public offerings  private sales of our equity securities and working capital and equipment financing loans 
in the future  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financings 
we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our utilization of capital  which will depend on a number of factors outside of our control 
while we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements through the next months  we cannot ensure that we will not require additional financing before that time 
we also cannot ensure that such additional financing will be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we could be required to delay development or commercialization of new products  to license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize ourselves or to reduce the marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations by payment due date payments by period in thousands under over contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt   operating leases     capital leases research and alliance agreements    total   we have not included interest payable on our revolving credit agreement in these amounts because it is calculated at a variable rate 
commercial commitments we have entered into two letters of credit to support certain purchase and other commitments in the amount of approximately million which expire in we have entered into a line of credit with our primary lender which has a maximum borrowing capacity of up to  and expires april and was subsequently amended in march as described in note to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to currency fluctuations 
we operate mainly in the us  europe and asia and we expect to continue to sell our products both within and outside of the us we expect to transact this business primarily in us dollars and in euros  although we may transact business in other currencies to a lesser extent 
future fluctuations in the value of these currencies may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
in addition  because we have a relatively long installation cycle for our systems  we will be subject to risk of currency fluctuations between the time we execute a purchase order and the time we deliver the system and collect payments under the order  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we have not hedged exposures in foreign currencies or entered into any other derivative instruments 
as a result  we will be exposed to some exchange risks for foreign currencies 
for example  if the currency exchange rate were to fluctuate by  we believe that our revenue could be affected by as much as to 
we also have exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and our borrowings 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing the risk of loss 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term debt instruments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities and marketable debt securities of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments generally have maturities of two years or less when acquired 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions 
accordingly  we believe that while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods covered by this report
