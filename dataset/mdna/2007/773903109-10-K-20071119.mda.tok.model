overview we are a leading global provider of industrial automation power  control and information products and services 
overall demand for our products and services is driven by investments in manufacturing capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  our customers needs for greater productivity  cost reduction  quality  safety and overall global competitiveness  industry factors that include our customers new product introductions  trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services  and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate  levels of global industrial production  regional factors that include local political  social  regulatory and economic circumstances  and the seasonal capital spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting processes and their working schedules

industrial economic trends in  sales to us customers accounted for percent of our total sales 
the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include industrial equipment spending is an economic statistic compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea 
this statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad us industrial economy 
global insights uses this statistic along with other economic indicators to forecast industrial equipment spending 
these measures over the longer term have proven to have reasonable predictive value as a directional indicator of our domestic growth 
capacity utilization  which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the federal reserve 
historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by our us customers in their manufacturing base 
the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi  published by the institute for supply management ism  which is an indication of the current and near term state of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism  a pmi measure above indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below indicates that it is generally contracting 
the table below depicts the continued general gradual improvement in us industrial equipment spending since december capacity utilization has remained above percent since december while the pmi has sustained a rate over since december although we have seen consistent strength over the past few years in the manufacturing indicators we follow  we are seeing a deceleration in the rate of manufacturing growth in the north american market

non us regional trends in  sales to non us customers accounted for percent of our total sales 
outside the us  demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets 
these customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and a growing number of local companies 
recent strength in demand for our products and services has  in part  been driven by investments in infrastructure in developing economies  investments in basic materials production capacity in response to higher commodity pricing and expanding consumer markets 
we continued to see strong demand in china  india and latin america during we also saw considerable growth in europe during  as we benefited from our targeted growth investments in customer facing resources and improving macro economic conditions 
we expect strong growth in latin america  europe and the emerging economies in asia pacific to continue into revenue by geographic region the table below presents our actual sales for the year ended september  by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended september  in millions  except percentages year ended september  change vs 
year ended september  change in organic sales vs 
year ended september  united states canada europe  middle east and africa asia pacific latin america total sales we attribute sales to the geographic regions based upon country of destination 
organic sales are sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions 
see supplemental sales information for information on this non gaap measure 
industry views we serve customers in a wide range of industries  including consumer  resource based and transportation 
our consumer industry customers are engaged in the food and beverage  home and personal care  and life sciences industries 
these customers needs include global expansion  incremental capacity from existing facilities  an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance 
in addition  these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors 
consumer products customers capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of resource based customers 
our customers in resource based industries  including oil and gas  mining  aggregates  metals  water wastewater  forest products and cement  all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials  both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries 
higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider investing in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies  such as intelligent motor controls 
in transportation  factors such as excess capacity  geographic expansion  investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales 
outlook for the following is a summary of our key objectives for continue to grow profitably and diversify our business  by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market and enhancing our market access both organically and through synergistic acquisitions  execute our cost productivity initiatives  expand our global business footprint with a focus on production efficiencies and enhanced customer experience  remain focused on our erp system implementation across the globe with minimal disruption to our business and clients  and sustain the growth of our integrated control and information architecture by accelerating the proliferation and adoption rate and enhancing features and functionality 
our outlook for is based on anticipated strength in customer demand in europe and emerging markets 
we believe our investments in technology leadership  expanded served markets and stronger global presence are creating more worldwide opportunities for growth than ever before  despite a deceleration in the rate of manufacturing growth in the north american market 
this ongoing diversification of our revenue base  combined with our recent acquisitions  cause us to be optimistic that will be another good year 
we remain intensely focused on executing our growth and productivity initiatives as we continue to evolve our global footprint  not just in manufacturing  but in engineering  back office and customer support infrastructure 
as of the date of filing this report  based upon current economic conditions and business trends  we expect revenue to grow by to percent in we anticipate acquisitions will contribute approximately percentage points to this growth rate and that our services and solutions business will continue to become a larger portion of our revenue 
we also believe that we will continue to benefit from the strong momentum in our growth initiatives  particularly process applications and safety 
we expect continued growth from the commercial investments we have made in emea and latin america  continued strength in emerging markets and improved performance in the asia pacific region  especially china  offset by somewhat slower rates of growth in developed economies 
as of the date hereof  we also expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average about to percent for the full year  subject to quarterly variability 
we anticipate an earnings benefit from volume leverage  productivity initiatives and a decrease in our year over year average share count 
these items will be partially offset by our investments in new products  services  technologies and expertise to serve new applications and markets  combined with inflation in material and employee costs and the globalization of our business model 
we also expect acquisitions will put downward pressure on operating margin and that  combined with purchase accounting expense  will have a negative impact on diluted earnings per share

financial condition the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions year ended september  cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash cash provided by used for continuing operations the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions cash provided by continuing operating activities capital expenditures of continuing operations tax payments related to the gain on divestiture of power systems excess income tax benefit from stock option exercises free cash flow our definition of free cash flow  which is a non gaap financial measure  takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy 
in the first quarter of we adopted sfas r see note in the financial statements  which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows 
in our opinion  free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments  service of debt principal  dividends and share repurchases 
we use free cash flow  as defined  as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies 
our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations 
operating  investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows 
cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects 
us federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds 
these taxes paid in have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses 
free cash flow was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in free cash flow was largely the result of the million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan trust in  compared to million of voluntary contributions in this increase was partially offset by increased working capital requirements during in january  we received billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses 
we used the cash proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture  to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire industrial control services group limited ics triplex 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock of which million shares did not settle until october the total cost of these shares was  million  of which million was recorded in accounts payable at september  this is compared to purchases of approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million in of these purchases  million shares amounting to million did not settle until october and were recorded in accounts payable at september  we anticipate repurchasing stock in  the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions  stock price and other cash requirements 
at september  we had approximately million remaining for stock repurchases under an existing board authorization 
on november   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional billion of shares of our common stock 
we expect future significant uses of cash to include repayments of short term borrowings and the million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal  repurchases of common stock  dividends to shareowners  capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans 
we expect capital expenditures in to be about million 
we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances  cash generated by operating activities  long term borrowings  commercial paper borrowings or proceeds from the sale of our securities in the capital markets 
on november   our board of directors authorized us to issue up to million of long term debt 
the proceeds of this debt  if issued  primarily would be used to reduce outstanding debt  including retiring the million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have access to existing financing sources  including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at september  and percent at september  our debt to total capital ratio at september  was influenced by the adoption of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r that occurred during commercial paper is our principal source of short term financing 
commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was percent 
at september   commercial paper borrowings outstanding were million  with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
in october  we entered into a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility 
our credit facility remains in effect and we had not drawn down under it at september  or borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding 
the terms of our credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio was to exceed percent 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility at september  and in addition to our million credit facility  short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately million at september  were available to foreign subsidiaries 
in september we entered into a day million unsecured revolving credit facility 
we terminated our million credit facility effective march   as we no longer considered the liquidity provided by this facility to be necessary 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook standard poor s a a stable moody s p a stable fitch ratings f a stable among other uses  we can draw our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper 
under our current policy with respect to these ratings  we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility  if any  to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow  if needed  to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding 
in such event  the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 
cash dividends to shareowners were million per share in  million per share in and million per share in although we declare and pay dividends at the sole discretion of our board of directors  we expect to pay quarterly dividends in of at least per outstanding share

e this item includes long term obligations under agreements with various service providers 
supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
therefore  changes in currency rates affect our reported sales 
sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales 
we believe that organic sales  defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions made during the period 
we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance 
we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect in the prior year 
we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period 
organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year 
no adjustments have been made to sales for acquisitions as the effect was not significant 
we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 
in prior years  we listed impairment of long lived assets as a critical accounting policy and estimate 
the most subjective portion of this balance was the reliance trademark relating to the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment 
with the sale of these businesses  including the related trademark  impairment of long lived assets is no longer considered a critical accounting policy and estimate 
retirement benefits pension benefits pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  the assumed annual compensation increase rate  the retirement rate  the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate 
changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 
our global pension expense in was million compared to million in approximately percent of our global pension expense relates to our us pension plan 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine our us pension expense included the following discount rate of percent compared to percent for  expected rate of return on plan assets of percent compared to percent for  and an assumed compensation increase rate of percent compared to percent for 
the increase in the us discount rate partially offset by the decrease in the expected rate of return on the us plan assets accounts for the majority of the decline in our global pension expense 
in  we made voluntary contributions of million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to million in the pension protection act of was signed into law in august interpretive guidance is still evolving 
we are currently evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions 
we estimate our pension expense will be approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million from for  our us discount rate will remain at percent 
the discount rate was set as of our june th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 
our assumed rate of return on us plan assets will remain at percent 
we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption 
we intend  over time  to change the us plan s mix of investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities 
we have assumed a us compensation increase rate of percent in compared to percent used in we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings 
the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of basis points in the key assumption for our us pension plans in millions pension benefits change in projected benefit obligation change in net periodic benefit cost discount rate more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note in the financial statements 
other postretirement benefits we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions  including the discount rate and  for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program  expected trends in the cost for healthcare services 
changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
the discount rate used to calculate our other postretirement benefits expense was percent compared to percent in 
for  the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to percent 
the discount rate was set as of our june th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 
effective october   we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services 
as a result of this amendment  our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since january  net periodic benefit cost recorded in continuing operations in was million compared to million in we expect net periodic benefit cost in of approximately million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate million 
the increase in net periodic benefit cost is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate by basis points to percent 
more information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note in the financial statements 
revenue recognition for approximately percent of our consolidated sales  we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred  as may be required according to contract terms  or services have been rendered 
we recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting 
we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable  we use the completed contract method for all others 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii units of delivery 
under the percentage of completion method  we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified 
we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
returns  rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product 
we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates  account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria 
certain distributors are offered a right to return product  subject to contractual limitations 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 
a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed 
if the time period were to change by percent  the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately million 
returns  rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided 
accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or  where a right of set off exists  as a reduction of accounts receivable 
the accrual for customer returns  rebates and incentives was million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 
fair value measurements we have increased the use of fair value measurements in our financial statements due to recent accounting pronouncements and obligations retained in connection with the sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation under sfas r 
compensation costs are based on the grant date fair value of the instruments using a valuation model  and are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term 
we estimate the average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument outstanding in order to determine fair value 
the valuation model is most sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions 
share based compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to million in and million in asset retirement obligations we account for conditional asset retirement obligations under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

we accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  development or the normal operation of the long lived asset 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional 
identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities 
we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site specific knowledge and historical industry expertise 
a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 
the application of fin resulted in a charge  net of tax  of million included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  which totaled million in other current liabilities and million in other liabilities at september  and million in other liabilities at september  indemnifications in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses  we agreed to indemnify baldor for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal  environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january   for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the purchase price 
we recorded a liability under fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin  related to these indemnification obligations with an offset to the gain on sale 
a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 
we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate million  of which million has been accrued in other current liabilities and million has been accrued in other liabilities at september  derivatives our accounting method for derivative instruments is based on sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the balance sheet  which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies 
we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 
unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets and total million and million at september  and  respectively 
unrealized losses on derivative instruments are recorded in other current liabilities and total million and million at september  and  respectively 
purchase accounting when we acquire a business  we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the valuation of acquired identifiable intangible assets and determination of their amortizable lives requires the use of management judgment and assumptions 
see note in the financial statements for a discussion of acquisitions in and litigation  claims and contingencies we record liabilities for litigation  claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation 
we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party 
at third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified  we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties 
at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party  we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation 
we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value 
environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup 
to the extent that remediation procedures change  additional contamination is identified  or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected  the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 
our reserve for environmental matters  net of related receivables  was million at september  and million at september  the change is primarily due to a legal settlement and changes in estimated remediation costs at three sites as a result of new information 
our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate 
the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low 
as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters  we expect that gradually  over a long period of time  our environmental obligations will decline 
however  changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 
various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business  including those pertaining to product liability 
as described in item legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago 
see item for further discussion 
our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount 
claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers 
we estimate the reserve for product liability claims  using our claims experience for the periods being valued 
adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims 
the reserve for product liability claims was million at september  and million at september  more information regarding litigation  claims and contingencies is contained in note in the financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions 
additionally  we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns  taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions 
cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products  services  and or intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures 
we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  according to the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
we have recorded an accrual of million at september  and million at september  that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits  which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
a final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit 
in the first quarter of  we will adopt fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
upon adoption of this standard  we will assess our position with regard to tax exposures and uncertain tax positions under its requirements rather than under sfas the adoption of fin as of october  will result in a decrease to shareowners equity of up to million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of million at september  and million at september  based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction 
the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforward amount will be realized 
our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards than currently expected 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate a base effective tax rate  which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income  permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies 
we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year to date basis  excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects 
we recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities  we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 
our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
at september   we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of million with original maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of percent  at september   we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of million with original maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
the weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper borrowings was percent during and percent during as these obligations mature  we issued  and anticipate continuing to issue  additional short term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 
changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations 
in and  a percent increase in average market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations 
we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was million at september  and million at september  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturity and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our million aggregate principal amount of notes  payable in  to floating rate debt based on six month libor 
the floating rate was percent at september  a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
in addition  we enter into contracts to hedge certain intercompany transactions forecasted to occur within the next three years 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars 
a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value in earnings immediately 
at september  and  we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro  british pound sterling  swiss franc  singapore dollar and south korean won 
the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents in millions of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to short long contracts outstanding by currency september  euro british pound sterling swiss franc singapore dollar south korean won other total all of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future 
we designated certain of these contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through october as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our consolidated balance sheet
