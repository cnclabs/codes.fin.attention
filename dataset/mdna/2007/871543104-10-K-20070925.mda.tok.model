our products play an essential role in network operations  quality of service of wireline  wireless and broadband communications networks  enabling our customers to increase performance and efficiency in their communications infrastructures 
during fiscal  we formed the quality of experience assurance division to pursue potential opportunities in the quality of experience qoe market for video services 
we believe that the qoe market holds the promise of faster revenue growth in the future than our historic lines of businesses 
the acquisition of qosmetrics sa forms the nucleus of this business 
symmetricom s customers include worldwide public network providers  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  public telephone and telegraph companies ptts  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  other telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable television operators  distributors and systems integrators  communications original equipment manufacturers oems  aerospace contractors  governments and research facilities 
our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the sunday closest to june fiscal and were week fiscal years  and fiscal was a week fiscal year 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we discontinued the operation of our specialty manufacturing other business segment 
specialty manufacturing other was part of our telecommunications solutions division 
this has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
on january   we acquired qosmetrics sa  a privately held provider of quality of experience qoe solutions for iptv internet protocol television 
the purchase price of approximately million was paid in cash 
we acquired qosmetrics sa for its technology  which we believe we can use to develop a line of products and services that will provide revenue growth in future years at a faster pace than our historic lines of business 
moreover  its target customers  as well as certain of its proprietary product features  are highly complementary with key parts of symmetricom s current operations 
with the acquisition of qosmetrics  we created a new business segment called the quality of experience assurance division 
on october   we acquired timing solutions corporation  a privately held company based in boulder  colorado that provides high performance time and frequency products and services for government  aerospace and military markets 
this acquisition further strengthens and broadens our leadership position in the time and frequency field  as well as brings new technology to address the test measurement market 
the total purchase price of approximately million was paid in cash 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting estimates due to their subjective nature and judgments involved in each business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  and the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
however  for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of the invoice is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is essential to product functionality 
we account for these transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an amount of revenue equal to our estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense when orders are shipped  at which time the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method cost to cost basis  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as a performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the income from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be uncollected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
accounting for income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 
in july  symmetricom puerto rico  a wholly owned subsidiary  moved its place of legal organization from delaware to bermuda in a transaction intended to be a tax free restructuring 
we are in the process of submitting a ruling request to the internal revenue service to confirm the tax free treatment 
we are undertaking this ruling request based upon our subsequent review of the restructuring 
although ruling requests of this nature are considered routine and we believe that it is more likely than not that the ruling will be granted  we cannot assure you that the ruling will be granted 
if the ruling is granted  symmetricom puerto rico would be treated as a branch of symmetricom  inc effective as of july and  accordingly  the profits of symmetricom puerto rico would be currently taxable for federal income tax purposes 
if granted  the ruling would result in an effective tax rate of approximately for fiscal compared to an effective tax rate of approximately for fiscal if the ruling is not granted  then we would be required to take a one time  non cash charge to our deferred tax assets of approximately million  symmetricom puerto rico would continue its election to indefinitely reinvest its future earnings outside of the united states and not repatriate future earnings back to symmetricom  inc  and the effective tax rate for fiscal would be approximately  compared to an effective tax rate of approximately for fiscal the large increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal would be due primarily to the one time million charge 
prior to fiscal  symmetricom puerto rico had elected to report its us taxes under section of the united state internal revenue code 
this election exempted qualified puerto rico earnings from regular federal income taxes  subject to various limitations 
section expired at the end of fiscal the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which are made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits is related to stock options and has a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
valuation of goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed a goodwill impairment test on the wireless oem business segment because the product pricing pressures and gross margin pressures continued to decline in the third quarter of fiscal and we did not anticipate a significant improvement 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount using discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
we review our intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write down of the other intangibles entirely related to our wireless business segment purchase in connection with the datum acquisition in october results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in our consolidated statement of operations year ended july  july  july  net revenue telecom solutions division wireline products wireless oem products global services timing  test and measurement division quality of experience assurance division total net revenue cost of products and services amortization of purchased technology impairment of intangibles integration and restructuring charges gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative acquired in process research and development amortization of intangibles integration and restructuring charges impairment of goodwill operating income loss gain on equity investments  net interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations gain from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal year outlook during fiscal year  revenue growth of versus prior year was favorably impacted by two large customers beginning an upgrade cycle to replace their legacy equipment 
revenue for fiscal year from these two customers may not increase or continue at the fiscal year level 
in particular  we do not currently expect substantial orders from these customers in the first half of fiscal  which will cause our revenue in the first two quarters to be below the level in the second half of fiscal fiscal year revenue was also favorably impacted by the acquisition of tsc in our fiscal second quarter 
we also expect fluctuations in quarterly revenue  as the upgrade projects undertaken by our customers are not systematic 
we expect the pace of operating expense growth for fiscal year to be greater than the prior year due to the full year impact of the acquisitions of tsc and qosmetrics  sa as well as increased spending levels in our emerging new quality of experience assurance business segment 
we expect fiscal year earnings to be unfavorably impacted by this increased spending  as well as an expected lower order volume from two large customers in the first half of compared to order levels at the end of fiscal year we expect revenues for fiscal year to be between million and million and earnings to be between and per share  on a fully diluted basis 
our fiscal year investment in our emerging quality of experience assurance business segment is projected to dilute annual earnings by approximately per share  on a fully diluted basis

section expired at the end of fiscal year year ended july  july  change change gain from discontinued operations  net of tax in thousands percentage of revenue discontinued operations during fiscal year  we discontinued the operation of the specialty manufacturing other business segment and the results  net of tax  are reflected in the results of operations for fiscal years and key operating metrics key operating metrics for measuring our performance include sales backlog  contract revenue  headcount and deferred revenue 
these metrics  which compare fiscal year with fiscal year  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of july   compared to million as of july  our backlog  which is shippable within the next six months  was million as of july   compared to million as of july  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of july   we had approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of july  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
headcount our consolidated headcount as of july  was comprised of regular employees and temporary employees  compared to regular employees and temporary employees as of july  deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of deferred revenue on sales of goods with special terms  which are recognized when the special terms are satisfied  maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  and distributor return allowances  which are based on historical return averages with certain distributors 
deferred revenue for sales of goods with special terms was million as of july   compared to million as of july  deferred revenue for maintenance contracts was million as of july   compared to million as of july  deferred revenue for distributor return allowances was million as of july   compared to million as of july  liquidity and capital resources as of july   working capital was million compared to million as of july  cash and cash equivalents as of july  decreased million to million from million as of july  this decrease was primarily the result of acquisitions paid in cash in the amount of million and a shift from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
as a result  short term investments increased from million as of july  to million as of july  the million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net income of million and non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  which was partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and million increase in inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal was the result of higher sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal and the increase in inventory was related to the tsc acquisition in october and higher finished goods inventory to meet customers shorter lead time requirements 
the million net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in purchases of short term investments  million cash payment for the acquisitions of qosmetrics sa and tsc  and million in purchases of plant and equipment 
this was partially offset by million in maturities of short term investments 
the million net cash used for financing activities was primarily attributable to million used to repurchase common stock and million to repay long term obligations 
this was partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
our total capital spending commitments outstanding as of july  were approximately million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of july   unchanged from july  we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
wells fargo line of credit on may   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association to obtain a revolving line of credit up to million to be used as working capital 
on june  this agreement was amended to allow us to increase the line of credit up to million 
on november  the agreement was amended to lower the line of credit to million 
the line of credit contains certain financial covenants and restrictions 
the line of credit expires on november  no borrowings were outstanding under this facility as of july  this line of credit is used to support a letter of credit for the million massachusetts development finance agency bond 
convertible subordinated notes on june   we sold million of contingent convertible subordinated notes the notes  which mature on june  and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in june and december of each year beginning on december  the notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt  including our indebtedness under our senior credit facilities 
the notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  prior to the maturity date into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock in the following circumstances prior to june   if the common stock price for a least trading days in the period of consecutive days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs is more than of the conversion price of the notes in effect on that th trading day  on or after june   at all times on or after any date on which the common stock price is more than of the then current conversion price  during the five consecutive business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes for each such trading day was less than of the average of the sale price of our common stock during such five trading day period multiplied by the then current conversion rate  if we have called the particular notes for redemption and the redemption has not yet occurred  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
holders may convert any outstanding notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price per share of  which was determined based on the reported closing price of our common stock of per share on june  also  on or after june   we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of redemption  payable in cash 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on june   and for a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of repurchase  payable in cash  in the event of certain change of control events related to us 
we may from time to time repurchase or redeem all or a portion of the notes  if necessary  to comply with nasdaq marketplace rule i d 
we may undertake such repurchase from time to time through privately negotiated or open market transactions or other available means

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires employers to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
previous standards required employers to disclose the complete funded status of its plans only in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  sfas no 
requires employers to measure plan assets and obligations at their year end balance sheet date 
guidance relating to the recognition of the over or under funded status of the plan and additional disclosure requirements is effective for periods ending after december  guidance relating to the measurement date of the plans is effective for the years ending after december  we determined that sfas no 
does not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet  statement of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for more information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab no 
permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
we do not believe that sab no 
has a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations

the final analysis will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of july   we had short term investments of million 
these investments in corporate debt securities have maturity dates of greater than three months 
our corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at july   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
the possibility exists that some of these issues may be downgraded as a result of disruptions in the credit market  however  we believe that we currently have the ability and currently intend to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business on june   we issued convertible subordinated notes with a fixed rate of  which would have no interest rate risk impact to our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business with various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
