there are two sources of new products products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements  and products in schering plough s late stage research pipeline 
with respect to acquisitions and licensing  schering plough has recently acquired some new product licenses 
however  there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late stage products that will have a positive material financial impact 
these limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding 
schering plough often competes for these opportunities against companies with greater financial resources 
strategy focused on science earlier this decade  schering plough experienced a number of business  regulatory  and legal challenges 
in april  the board of directors named fred hassan as the new chairman of the board and chief executive officer of schering plough corporation 
with support from the board  he recruited a new senior executive team and initiated a strategic plan  with the goal of stabilizing  repairing and turning around schering plough in order to build long term shareholder value

as part of this effort  schering plough is enhancing infrastructure  upgrading processes and systems  and strengthening talent both the recruitment of talented individuals and the development of key employees 
while these efforts are companywide  schering plough is focusing especially on research and development 
a key component of the action agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs 
research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases 
as a result  a core strategy of schering plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments with important medical and commercial value 
consistent with this core strategy  schering plough has been increasing its investment in research and development 
schering plough s progressing pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas with compounds now approaching or in phase i development 
as schering plough continues to develop the later phase growth drivers of the pipeline eg  thrombin receptor antagonist  golimumab  vicriviroc and hcv protease inhibitor  it anticipates higher spending on clinical trial activities 
results highlights of schering plough s performance in are as follows schering plough s net sales in were billion  an increase of billion  or percent  as compared to the period 
net income available to common shareholders in was billion  as compared to million in cash flow from operating activities was billion in global sales of schering plough s cholesterol franchise products  vytorin and zetia  made by the cholesterol joint venture with merck company  inc merck continued to grow in and significantly contributed to schering plough s improved operating results and cash flow 
in addition  increased sales of 
table of contents pharmaceutical products such as remicade  nasonex  temodar  and clarinex also contributed favorably to schering plough s overall operating results and cash flow 
schering plough gained approvals for new products and indications  including for the life saving antifungal medicine noxafil oral suspension in the united states and eu for the prevention of invasive fungal infections noxafil was discovered in schering plough s research laboratories  temodal in japan for the treatment of a form of brain cancer  malignant glioma  remicade in the eu for ulcerative colitis  and suboxone sublingual tablets in the eu for opioid dependence 
schering plough streamlined the global supply chain to yield expected annualized cost savings of about million 
schering plough reached an agreement with the us attorney s office for the district of massachusetts and the us department of justice to settle a previously disclosed investigation that related to actions that took place prior to the agreement provided for an aggregate settlement amount of million 
this settlement did not have a material adverse effect on schering plough s results of operations  financial condition or its business 
strategic alliances as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry  schering plough licenses manufacturing  marketing and or distribution rights to certain products to others  and also manufactures  markets and or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements 
any time that third parties are involved  there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of schering plough that may create positive or negative impacts on schering plough 
vytorin  zetia and remicade are subject to such arrangements and are key to schering plough s current business and financial performance 
in addition  any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements  which could result in vytorin and zetia being acquired by merck or remicade reverting back to centocor 
the change in control provision relating to vytorin and zetia is included in the contract with merck  filed as exhibit r to schering plough s k  and the change of control provision relating to remicade is contained in the contract with centocor  filed as exhibit v to schering plough s k 
cholesterol franchise schering plough s cholesterol franchise products  vytorin and zetia  are managed through a joint venture between schering plough and merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels 
zetia is schering plough s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor 
vytorin is the combination of zetia and zocor  merck s statin medication 
the financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with merck  and profits from the sales of vytorin and zetia are also shared with merck 
the operating results of the joint venture with merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
a material change in the sales or market share of schering plough s cholesterol franchise would have a significant impact on schering plough s results of operations and cash flows 
in order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business  schering plough must continue to increase profits 
this increased profitability is largely dependent upon the performance of schering plough s cholesterol franchise 
the cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world 
vytorin and zetia are competing in this market and  on a combined basis  these products continued to grow in terms of market share during as a franchise  the two products together have captured more than percent of total prescriptions for the us cholesterol management market based on january ims data 
japan is not included in the joint venture with merck 
in the japanese market  bayer healthcare will co market schering plough s cholesterol absorption inhibitor  zetia  upon approval 
schering plough anticipates receiving this approval in japan in  but due to a backlog of new drug applications in japan  schering plough cannot precisely predict the timing of the approval

remicade is schering plough s second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line after the cholesterol franchise 
remicade is licensed from and manufactured by centocor  inc  a johnson johnson company 
schering plough has the exclusive marketing rights to this product outside of the us  japan and certain asian markets 
during  schering plough exercised an option under its contract with centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab  a new tnf alpha monoclonal antibody  in the same territories as remicade 
golimumab is currently in phase iii trials 
schering plough and centocor have been collaborating in resolving the difference in the parties opinions as to the expiration date of schering plough s rights to golimumab 
in august  schering plough received a determination through arbitration that its rights to market golimumab will extend to years after the first commercial sales in its territories  but centocor has appealed the ruling

schering plough continually reviews the business  including manufacturing operations  to identify actions that will enhance long term competitiveness 
however  schering plough s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed  and actions to significantly reduce schering plough s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues 
as a result  shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements  including revalidation and registration requirements 
during  schering plough closed one manufacturing plant and took other streamlining actions 
schering plough continues to review the carrying value of manufacturing assets for indications of impairment 
future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments or related costs 
regulatory and competitive environment schering plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national  state and local regulatory agencies 
regulatory compliance is complex and costly  impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications 
since  schering plough has been working under a us fda consent decree to resolve issues involving schering plough s compliance with current good manufacturing practices at certain of its manufacturing sites in new jersey and puerto rico 
under the terms of the decree  provided that the fda has not notified schering plough of a significant violation of fda law  regulations  or the decree in any five year period since the decree s entry in may  schering plough may petition the court to have the decree dissolved and fda will not oppose schering plough s petition

discussion of operating results net sales a significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the us consequently  net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors  retail chains and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions or other factors 
in addition to these fluctuations  sales of many pharmaceutical products in the us are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups  institutions  government agencies  and other groups seeking discounts 
schering plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the us market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the medicaid program  the veterans health care program  and other government funded programs
