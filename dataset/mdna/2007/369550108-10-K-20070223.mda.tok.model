management overview general dynamics is a market leader in business aviation  land and expeditionary combat vehicles and systems  armaments  and munitions  shipbuilding and marine systems  and mission critical information systems and technologies 
the company operates through four business groups aerospace  combat systems  marine systems and information systems and technology 
general dynamics primary customers are the us military  other government organizations  the armed forces of allied nations  and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft 
the company operates in two primary markets defense and business aviation 
the majority of the company s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 
sales by customer base logo the nation s engagement in the global war on terror  coupled with the need to modernize us military forces  has driven steady department of defense funding increases since in particular  procurement and research and development r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of the company s revenues 
these budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases  demonstrating administration and congressional support 
defense department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of percent from fiscal through  while procurement and r d spending has grown percent annually during that period 
for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion for the department of defense  including approximately billion for procurement and r d 
for fiscal year  the president has requested that the congress appropriate billion for the department of defense  an percent increase over the funding 
this includes billion for procurement and r d  an increase of percent over during this period of war  defense budgets have included the president s budget submission  as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter 
for fiscal year  the administration requested  and the congress appropriated  approximately billion in supplemental funding 
congress has recently been asked to provide an additional billion  which  if approved  will bring total defense funding for fiscal year to approximately billion  an percent increase since notably  approximately percent  or billion  of the anticipated supplemental funding is requested for additional investment spending 
while these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels  some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover short term war needs 
in addition  supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations 
these two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company s programs 
looking ahead  the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term  led by the need to continue to support the operations in iraq and afghanistan 
while the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period  the company expects near term defense funding to be driven by the following continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the congress  the size of the us military  including the number of troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan  and the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war 
based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets  the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in and defense funding logo general dynamics annual report 
table of contents beyond the company s us defense market  governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs  leading to expanding defense export opportunities 
the company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies 
while the revenue upside can be significant  european and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures 
as general dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world  the company expects growing international sales 
the business aviation market also continues to expand  and was another strong year 
in particular  the market for the company s business jets outside the united states is growing at an increasingly rapid rate 
in  gulfstream received percent of its aircraft orders from outside north america 
of note  the european market  including russia  made up more than percent of the group s orders in  and demand remains strong 
to meet this demand and maximize the company s opportunities in the near term  the aerospace group is increasing annual deliveries prudently while focusing on margins 
looking ahead  as part of a continual effort to bring new technology and products to market  the company is making investments in the aerospace group s facilities to support the robust global business jet demand and a growing aircraft services market 
the company expects continued growth in the business jet market  stemming from a strong product selection in the long range and ultra long range markets  and robust sales of the company s mid size products 
general dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices  disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements 
the company s solid performance over the past years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow 
general dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has enabled it to consistently deploy resources to enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
consolidated overview results of operations year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin general dynamics net sales increased significantly in  with each of the company s business groups contributing to the sales growth 
increased new aircraft deliveries in the aerospace group  strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the combat systems group  and acquisitions in the information systems and technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales 
higher activity on early stage ship construction programs in the marine systems group also added to the sales increase 
the growth in the company s operating earnings outpaced the increase in sales in double digit earnings growth occurred in all four businesses 
a key driver was performance in the marine systems group  which saw operating earnings rise over percent 
in the aerospace group  operating earnings increased significantly on strong volume in new aircraft sales and continued pricing improvements 
for the company as a whole  this led to a basis point increase in the company s operating margins to percent in from percent in the company s focus on operations has led to improved margins in each of the last three years  resulting in a basis point improvement since logo general dynamics annual report 
table of contents year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the company produced strong growth in sales and operating earnings in the information systems and technology group led the increase  generating over the half of the company s sales growth over the combat systems and aerospace groups also contributed to the increase in sales  while the marine systems group s sales in were steady compared with increased volume in the information systems and technology  combat systems and aerospace groups drove the growth in operating earnings 
the company s earnings were boosted by the aerospace group  whose earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in  driven by continued strong demand for business jets 
the growth was partly offset by program losses in the marine systems group during the year 
the company s margins increased to percent in compared with percent in cash flow the company s cash flow from operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings in each of the past three years  continuing the company s consistent record of generating substantial cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in and and billion in in addition  the company generated over in cash in both and from the sale of several non core businesses 
over the three year period  the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase its common stock  pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt

discontinued operations in  general dynamics completed the sale of its aggregates operation 
the company received approximately in cash from the sale of this business and recognized an after tax gain of approximately in discontinued operations 
in addition  in the company initiated a process to sell its coal mining operation and recognized an estimated after tax loss of approximately in discontinued operations in connection with the anticipated sale 
with the sale of the aggregates business and the expected sale of the coal business  the operations previously reported as resources have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
in  as part of its efforts to focus on performance  general dynamics identified a number of operations that were not core to the company and could be divested 
as a result  the company completed the sale of several small businesses in the second half of and the first quarter of the company received approximately in cash  net of income taxes  and reported an after tax loss of in from the sale of these businesses 
the company s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses  and their operating results are included as discontinued operations  net of income taxes

backlog logo general dynamics total backlog increased percent in to billion at december the funded backlog grew percent  reaching billion at year end 
in  the company received significant new orders in each of its business groups  totaling billion  including a record level of order activity in the aerospace group 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the total backlog for the company s defense businesses grew to billion at the end of  compared with billion at year end the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog was billion at december  this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  the company has included in backlog only those programs it believes are likely to receive funding 
the aerospace group s total backlog reached a new high of billion at december   up percent over the year end backlog of billion each excluding aircraft options 
the aerospace funded backlog  an indicator of near term demand  grew percent to billion at the end of as orders continued at a record pace 
the funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
the aerospace unfunded backlog of at december   consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
the company s backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts  unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft 
idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
these agreements  which set forth the majority of the contractual terms  including prices  are funded as delivery orders are placed 
a significant portion of the company s idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole source supplier to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies 
management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems 
however  because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
contract options in the company s defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts  if the customer exercises the option 
these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date 
contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft 
the company recognizes unexercised options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 
as of december   the potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  which may be realized over the next years 
this represents management s estimate of potential value the company will receive 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 
review of operating segments aerospace results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group produced significant net sales growth in due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries to meet increased demand 
in  the group delivered additional green aircraft  a percent increase over completions increased by units  or percent 
a notable driver of the increased deliveries was the introduction of the mid size g aircraft  which had green deliveries and eight completions in aircraft services volume also increased in  while pre owned aircraft sales were consistent with of note  pre owned aircraft deliveries as a percent of the group s total unit deliveries declined to percent in from percent in and percent in  as more of the group s customers chose to sell their pre owned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in to the company 
the group s operating earnings and margins increased in as a result of the additional new aircraft volume and continued pricing improvements in all aircraft models 
improved margins on pre owned aircraft sales also contributed to the earnings and margin growth in these increases in operating earnings were counteracted somewhat by a mix shift in the second half of the year that included proportionately more lower margin  mid size aircraft deliveries  as well as higher spending on research and development 
the group s resulting operating margins improved basis points over general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the company expects substantial sales growth in the aerospace group in the group is projecting new aircraft deliveries in  a percent increase over  and the production schedule is substantially sold out 
based on new aircraft orders over the past two years  the group anticipates continued pricing improvements on units to be delivered in the company expects the effect of these pricing improvements and continued operational efficiencies to offset a further shift in aircraft mix toward mid size aircraft and increasing product development spending 
as a result  the company expects the group s margins in to approximate those achieved in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s net sales increased in because of higher new aircraft sales and increased aircraft services volume 
green aircraft deliveries were up percent  and completions were up percent 
this growth was offset in part by lower pre owned aircraft sales 
operating earnings and margins in grew significantly as a result of increased new aircraft volume  a more favorable mix of deliveries and improved pricing 
favorable cost performance in the aircraft services business and higher pre owned aircraft earnings due to improved market conditions also contributed to the increase in earnings in summary of aircraft statistical information sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s completion  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics 
the company records revenues at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group s orders and backlog year ended december new orders options exercised firm orders as of december firm contracts in backlog completions in backlog represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end 
the backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft 
backlog logo the aerospace group s backlog grew percent in to billion at year end 
the group s funded backlog was billion at december   up percent over the funded backlog made up over percent of the group s total backlog 
in  the group received a record level of orders for the third consecutive year 
new aircraft orders have increased nearly percent in each of the past three years 
for seven out of the eight quarters in and  the group achieved a book to bill ratio orders divided by sales greater than one 
new aircraft book to bill ratio logo represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries in units during the year 
the group s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through netjets inc netjets  a unit of berkshire hathaway inc 
and the leader in the fractional aircraft market  is responsible for a significant portion of the group s backlog 
netjets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program 
the group s funded backlog at year end included approximately with netjets  representing firm contracts for aircraft  including green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in the unfunded backlog included approximately with netjets for maintenance and support services 
the group also has aircraft options with netjets 
due to the uncertainty and extended time frames associated with the large quantity aircraft orders historically placed by netjets  particularly for mid size aircraft  the company has removed from the backlog a netjets order for g aircraft 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the company has also removed options for gs and gs that had been included in the aerospace group s potential contract value 
deliveries of aircraft to netjets are scheduled from through and represent from percent to percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years 
scheduled deliveries of aerospace funded backlog logo the group s remaining billion of funded backlog at year end consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately of contracts with government customers 
combat systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group generated substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings in compared with the group benefited from strong domestic and international demand for its combat vehicles and armaments and munitions products  due in part to ongoing us operations in iraq and afghanistan 
combat systems operating margins were down slightly in because of a shift in mix from higher margin products throughout the group  including the exit from commercial trading activities in the group s european operations 
the stryker wheeled combat vehicle contract continued to be the group s largest program  with total deliveries to date approaching  units 
stryker deliveries in included the mobile gun system and nuclear  biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicles  the final two of the variants in the stryker family of combat vehicles 
the group also experienced higher activity on several other combat vehicle programs during  including the army s future combat systems fcs program and various domestic and international light armored vehicle lav contracts 
in particular  sales were up significantly in the group s european business from volume that had been delayed on a number of vehicle production programs  including the pandur ii wheeled armored vehicle 
high demand in the group s armament business for systems that protect us combat forces was also a strong contributor to the increased sales 
in the group s munitions business  a late award to provide small caliber ammunition to the army also made a significant contribution to the group s growth in the group s acquisition of chamberlain manufacturing corporation s scranton operation scranton operation on july   contributed approximately percent of the group s sales growth over the scranton operation is a supplier of large caliber projectile metal parts to the us government 
in january  the group acquired snc technologies inc snc tec  with operations in quebec  canada  from snc lavalin group inc snc tec is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small  medium and large caliber ammunition and related products to the canadian forces  other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world 
the company expects the combat systems group to experience sales growth in the low double digit range in  including the effect of the snc tec acquisition 
operating margins in should improve somewhat over the margins 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group produced solid growth in net sales and operating earnings in higher production activity on the stryker program was the largest contributor to this increase 
volume also increased on the ma abrams tank system enhancement package program  the canadian rg mine protected personnel vehicle contract and the saudi arabian national guard lav contract 
in the armaments and munitions businesses  demand increased in for reactive armor  systems that protect us combat forces  and large  medium and small caliber ammunition 
these increases were offset in part by lower sales volume in the group s european business stemming from delays in the timing of customer requirements and the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in general dynamics annual report

general dynamics annual report 
table of contents marine systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the marine systems group s net sales increased in due primarily to an increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the us navy 
activity continued to increase in on the t ake combat logistics ship and virginia class submarine construction programs 
in  the company delivered the lewis and clark  the first ship under the current nine ship t ake contract 
ships two through six are currently under construction 
the virginia class program includes a four ship cost reimbursable block i contract and a six ship fixed priced block ii contract 
in  the group delivered the texas and the hawaii  the second and third ships of the block i contract 
the fourth block i ship is scheduled for delivery in  and construction has begun on the first four ships of the block ii contract 
the group also continued construction of its first littoral combat ship and detail design of the ddg next generation destroyer 
the growth on these programs was offset in part by declining volume on the group s contract to convert four ballistic missile submarines to a conventional strike configuration ssgn and its commercial tanker contract 
the group returned to service the second and third ssgns  the florida and the michigan  and completed the final commercial tanker in marine systems produced significant improvement in operating earnings in  resulting in an increase in operating margins of basis points over the most notable impact came from the group s commercial tanker program and its submarine repair and overhaul business 
in  the group experienced of cost growth on its contract to build four double hull oil tankers  which negatively impacted operating earnings and margins 
the final ship under this contract was delivered in  two weeks ahead of schedule 
final settlement of the contract with the customer and efficiencies achieved in labor hour performance on the completion of the contract generated positive earnings on the contract in the group also recorded losses on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in totaling approximately these losses resulted from customer requested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contract protection 
the group has implemented a more structured approach to managing customer change requirements  and the performance in the group s overhaul and repair business improved significantly in operating earnings and margins in also benefited from increased profitability on the group s arleigh burke class ddg destroyer construction program 
in  marine systems delivered the farragut and the gridley  the th and th ships of the class completed by the group 
the group continues to generate significant labor hour efficiencies and cost savings on the program  which includes delivery of seven more ships through the group experienced cost growth in on the navy s t ake program primarily from engineering and design related changes imposed by the customer 
the company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking approximately of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused by these changes 
the navy is evaluating the claim  and the company expects a resolution of this matter in the company is recording revenue at a break even level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim see note g to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects sales in the marine systems group in to be similar to the volume  with improving margins as the virginia class  ddg and t ake programs in particular continue to achieve efficiencies associated with program maturity and shipyard capital investments 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  the marine systems group s net sales were consistent with higher volume on the virginia class submarine and t ake programs was offset by the completion of the seawolf class submarine program in  lower activity on the group s commercial tanker contract  and fewer repair and engineering contracts 
program losses in adversely affected the group s operating earnings and margins 
as previously discussed  the company recognized losses on its commercial tanker contract and two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in  which depressed the group s operating earnings and margins

the contract has a potential value of  including options to extend the contract through information systems and technology results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the information systems and technology group s net sales and operating earnings increased in  due largely to business acquisitions in and in  the company acquired anteon international corporation anteon and fc business systems  inc fcbs  to expand the group s information technology it and mission services business 
the company completed three smaller acquisitions in the group s tactical communications systems business in in addition to acquisitions  the group experienced solid growth in its domestic it services and tactical communications systems businesses  including the following key programs intelligence information  command and control equipment and enhancements ice  which supports critical intelligence and command and control systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide  network centric solutions netcents  which provides information technology  networking  and voice  video and data communications products and services to support the us air force  common hardware software iii chs  which provides updated commercial and ruggedized computers  network equipment and software to the us armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide  canadian maritime helicopter project mhp  which provides integrated mission systems for state of the art helicopters that are intended to replace canada s aging fleet of marine helicopters  and mobile user objective system muos  which enables on the move satellite connectivity for us and allied forces 
increased demand for wireless network solutions for commercial wireless carriers also contributed to the group s sales growth 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the group s sales growth in was tempered by the anticipated decline in activity on several programs  in particular the united kingdom s bowman program and the pentagon renovation contract 
bowman is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces 
in the second half of  the bowman program began transitioning from the production and installation phase to maintenance and long term support activities 
the group s intelligence systems business also experienced lower volume in the group s resulting organic growth over was approximately percent 
in  the group s contract mix began to transition from a core holding of mature production programs to include more development stage contracts  which typically carry lower margins and lower revenue levels 
in addition  the group faced delays in some of its programs as the defense department shifted funds away from these contracts to support the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
these factors limited the group s sales growth in and  when combined with the impact of lower margins contributed by recently acquired businesses  led to a slight decrease in the group s operating margins for the year 
in  the company expects to percent sales growth for the group  with some reduction in operating margins as the group integrates the recent acquisitions and the shift in contract mix continues

general dynamics annual report 
table of contents application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition government contracts 
the company accounts for sales and earnings under long term government contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg  costs incurred or output eg  units delivered measures  as appropriate to the circumstances 
the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including g a expenses 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
the company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  management considers the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
the company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 
business aircraft 
the company accounts for contracts for business jet aircraft in accordance with statement of position these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
the company records revenue at two points when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 
pre owned aircraft inventories 
in connection with orders for new aircraft  the company routinely offers customers trade in options 
under these options  if exercised  the company will accept trade in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value 
it is the company s policy to limit the aerospace group s investment in pre owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to  unless specifically authorized 
once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft  the company records pre owned aircraft at the lower of trade in value or estimated net realizable value 
the company treats any excess of the trade in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate 
the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information 
these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors  including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
gross margins on sales of pre owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 
commitments and contingencies 
the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company s exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of the company s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of the company s estimated workers compensation  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under the company s contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on management s best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of the company s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
the company s defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
the company determines the long term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the company s commercial pension plans and post retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on increase bps decrease bps increase decrease to net pension income from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease to post retirement benefit cost from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets the company s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company s government retirement plans 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as such  the company s future earnings are not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 
management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers  long term debt and certain inter company transactions denominated in currencies other than the company s or one of its subsidiaries functional currency 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non functional payments  receipts and inter company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities 
these contracts are designed to minimize non functional currency risks and or risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency 
at december  and  the company had billion and  respectively  in notional contracts outstanding 
a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized pretax loss of in and in  and an incremental unrealized pretax loss of in and in this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in us dollar canadian dollar exchange rates 
the company believes the realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 
financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations  variable rate commercial paper and short term investments 
as of december   the company had only fixed rate debt outstanding 
the company s fixed rate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market 
the company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper  but there were no outstanding balances at year end or the company s investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years 
as of december   the company held billion in cash and equivalents to be used for general corporate purposes 
given the average weighted maturity of days  a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates 
the company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices  primarily on long term fixed price contracts 
to the extent possible  the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk 
the company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant 
some of the protective terms included in the company s contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract 
the company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows
