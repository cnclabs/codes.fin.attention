the business storm cat energy is an independent oil and gas company focused on exploration and development of unconventional gas reserves  which are reserves from fractured shales  coal and tight sand formations 
the company has producing properties in wyoming s powder river basin prb 
our business model consists of three strategies acquiring producing properties with drilling prospects in focused basins in both the united states and canada  exploring areas of moderate risk  and initiating higher risk projects with the potential for higher reward 
storm cat continues to execute on its long term strategy of growth through continued development and the acquisition of prospective acreage that exploits the abilities of the company s technical team 
storm cat achieved the operational goals that it targeted for net proved reserves increased from bcf at year end to bcf for year end net production increased from mmcf d year end to mmcf d at year end storm cat was also able to finance and close on a significant acquisition in the prb that doubled production and added significant drilling opportunities in and around its core area in northeast spotted horse 
the company added a forth core area by acquiring acreage in the fayetteville shale in arkansas which the exploration activities are scheduled to begin in the summer of the technical team was expanded in canada with the addition of a senior geologist and landman 
canada has a host of unconventional drilling opportunities 
storm cat acquired and drilled on its acreage in alberta for both the mannville and horseshoe canyon coals as further describe below in the regional summaries 
the company s elk valley play is still a significant exploration prospect 
storm cat drilled two wells in but the completions in january were not properly implemented 
the technical team evaluated several completion techniques and service companies  and five new wells were drilled in and properly completed as further outlined below in the elk valley summary 
storm cat produced bcf in compared with bcf in the company drilled gross wells in of which were drilled in the prb 
finding and development costs in the prb total approximately per mcf to date 
total capital expenditures for were million 
acquisition and acreage purchases totaled million leaving a balance of million which was spent on drilling and other capitalized expenditures 
the company has over drilling locations remaining in the prb alone 
the other three focus areas  if successful  will double the number of drilling locations providing storm cat ample room to grow through drilling 
the company funded its million capital budget with cash on hand  equity and debt 
storm cat had million in cash on january  on september   storm cat raised approximately million through the sale of it shares see liquidity and capital resources for further information 
another million was raised through the exercise of warrants and options 
also in september  the company entered into a million senior credit facility with jpmorgan  subject to a borrowing base 
based on the company s proven reserves  storm cat was able to draw down million in senior debt and an additional million in bridge financing used for the prb acquisition 
the million bridge loan was subsequently repaid in full 
storm cat is in the process of setting its targets for it has already drilled and completed wells in the prb during the first quarter of the company plans on maintaining focus on its four key areas the prb  fayetteville shale  elk valley  and alberta 
management expects production and proved reserves in the prb to continue to grow throughout the year 
the company plans to establish reserves in the fayetteville shale in through the drilling of wells on its acreage 
the production results from the five elk valley wells should provide management with data to determine the success of the drilling and completion program by summer of storm cat s technical team will continue to monitor the progress being made on the company s mannville and horseshoe canyon plays in alberta 
to finance its activity in  storm cat closed on a its series a subordinated convertible notes due march  the series a notes and expects to close on its series b subordinated convertible notes due march  the series b notes in march the series a notes provided the company with million in the first quarter of part of the proceeds was used to repay the remaining million bridge financing to jpmorgan 
the series b notes will make available million of additional capital provided shareholders approve the underlying shares needed to close the transaction 
the shareholder vote is expected to be held on march  the company also has hedged approximately of its current net daily production to protect cash flow from and adverse decline in commodity prices 
please see item a quantitative and qualitative analysis for further discussion about the company s cash flow hedges 
basin summary activity in the powder river basin on may   storm cat closed a mineral leasehold transaction in the powder river basin  campbell county  wyoming  with two private companies 
the acquisition included an interest in  gross  net undeveloped acres 
as consideration  was paid in cash at closing and the private companies retained a carried interest as to capital costs covering their working interest to be paid over a period of months after closing 
on june   storm cat acquired six state tracts in sheridan county  wyoming totaling  gross and net acres at a wyoming state lease sale for million lease bonus average of acre 
development preparation has begun on the acreage including permitting of locations and water management planning 
development should consist of multi seam wells 
on august   but effective as of july   the company acquired producing leases totaling  gross acres and  net acres in wyoming s powder river basin for million 
in accordance with us gaap  all revenues and expenses prior to the closing date were an adjustment to the purchase price 
after the closing date  operations related to these properties are recorded to revenue and expenses in the normal course of business 
the production from this field represented of production volumes and of natural gas revenue  and the reserves attributable to this acquisition comprise approximately of estimated proved reserves as of december  on september   storm cat entered into a joint development agreement with an unaffiliated third party to jointly develop certain lands for coalbed methane in the powder river basin 
under this agreement  storm cat and its partner will establish an area of mutual interest in which storm cat will act as operator 
the company acquired an undivided of its partner s working interest and production in existing wells  leasehold and infrastructure 
the company will have the option to earn an undivided interest in its partner s leasehold within the area of mutual interest through development 
at december   storm cat had operational control of approximately  gross acres and  net acres 
at year end the company was operating wells and owned a working interest percentage in additional non operated wells 
for the full year of  wells were spud 
wells drilled during were concentrated in our northeast spotted horse and jamison twenty mile operating areas 
at year end  the powder river basin exit rate production was mmcf d gross and mmcf d net 
the powder river basin production currently comprises of storm cat s production 
activity in the fayetteville shale area of arkansas on may   storm cat closed a million transaction in the fayetteville shale play in arkansas with two private operators 
the company acquired an interest in approximately  gross undeveloped acres and  net mineral acres in van buren  pope and searcy counties  arkansas at a cost per net acre of in the arkoma basin s fayetteville shale play in arkansas  the company owned or controlled  gross and  net acres at december  this property consists of an net revenue interest in  gross  net acres and an net revenue interest in  gross  net acres in the fayetteville shale prospect area of arkansas mostly in van buren county 
storm cat plans to commence drilling on the first of six net wells in the fayetteville shale beginning mid year at year end  storm cat was participating in non operated fayetteville shale wells where it owned between a and working interest 
these wells were at various stages of planning  drilling  completion or production 
activity in british columbia  canada elk valley in elk valley  british columbia  storm cat farmed in on approximately  gross  net acres on an unconventional natural gas prospect 
on october   the company assumed operatorship of the elk valley land and the former operator retained a overriding royalty interest 
during  the company drilled and completed five wells in elk valley 
these wells are currently on production and have begun the de watering stage 
storm cat expects to have preliminary production results from these wells during the second half of activity in alberta  canada western canadian sedimentary basin in the western canadian sedimentary basin of alberta  canada  storm cat owned or controlled approximately  gross acres and  net acres at december  efforts have been focused on evaluating the potential of the horseshoe canyon and mannville coals 
horseshoe canyon has been established as a commercial production target in the western canadian sedimentary basin  while the mannville coals are still in the early stages of development 
during the course of  storm cat experienced a greater than eight fold increase in its undeveloped acreage position from a starting point of  acres gross and net 
in  five gross wells were drilled 
this total includes two wells drilled at no cost to the company through a farm out of its interest in two sections of land 
the alberta  canada acreage is concentrated in five main areas 
from north to south these are judy creek  redwater  wetaskiwin  wainwright and cessford 
the wetaskiwin area is prospective for gas from the horseshoe canyon and the mannville coals while the other areas are all prospective for gas from the mannville coals 
during  storm cat participated in the drilling of three wells in the cessford area on a drill to earn farm out deal 
two of the wells were drilled at no cost to the company 
the first well drilled was a vertical test which targeted a lower mannville channel sand as well as the mid mannville coal 
the channel sand was wet  and the well was completed uphole in the mannville coal section 
a core was cut through the coals 
subsequent analysis showed significant quantities of gas in place  which led to the decision to begin horizontal development drilling 
the remaining four earning wells have been farmed out to a third party 
two of the wells have been drilled  and the remaining two earning wells are scheduled to be drilled in the first and second quarters of during the fourth quarter of  storm cat drilled a  meter vertical test in the judy creek area to evaluate the potential of the mannville coals as well as unconventional targets in the colorado shale 
the coals encountered were deemed to be too thin to follow up with horizontal wells 
storm cat drilled a meter vertical well in the wetaskiwin area that was designed to test the gas potential of the horseshoe canyon coal as well as conventional targets in the belly river and edmonton sand 
the well encountered gas pay in both the upper belly river sand and the horseshoe canyon 
based on these results  the company has entered into a drill to earn deal to earn a working interest in four sections of land subject to a non convertible overriding royalty 
we will earn an interest in one section with each well drilled 
tie in options are currently being evaluated 
activity in alaska the company has an net revenue interest in  gross  net acres and an net revenue interest in  gross  net acres in the cook inlet region of alaska 
storm cat drilled one well in this area in the company is in the process of evaluating the completion potential and costs based upon equipment availability 
activity in saskatchewan  canada moose mountain storm cat previously owned a working interest in the moose mountain exploration project in saskatchewan  covering  gross acres of unconventional natural gas exploration 
storm cat drilled  cased and completion tested three moose mountain wells in this property was impaired in the amount of million in the third quarter of the company sold its working interest in this property to avoid plugging and abandonment costs  but retained a overriding royalty interest 
activity in mongolia as of december   storm cat had fully impaired its mongolia property for a total of million 
business risks the exploration for and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of natural gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for shareholders 
generating reserve and production growth while containing costs represents an ongoing focus for management  and is made particularly important in the company s business by the natural production and reserve decline associated with oil and gas properties 
in addition to developing new reserves  storm cat competes to acquire additional reserves  which involves judgments regarding recoverable reserves  future gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
during periods of historically high gas prices  third party contractor and material cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
other challenges the company faces include attracting and retaining qualified personnel  gaining access to equipment and supplies and maintaining access to capital on sufficiently favorable terms 
please see risk factors under item a for more information about these risks and others 
storm cat has taken the following steps to mitigate the challenges it faces the company actively manages its exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of expected production through the use of derivatives 
detailed hedging policy and procedures are outlined in the company s hedging policy 
storm cat has a multi year inventory of attractive drilling locations and a diverse balance of cbm properties  allowing it the opportunity to grow reserves and replace and expand production organically 
the company has put in place a delegation of authority policy outlining the hierarchy of authorization for expenditures and commitments and to provide checks and balances 
a comprehensive authorization for expenditure afe policy allows for the tracking of all significant capital expenditures so that budget to actual integrity can be monitored and maintained 
storm cat uses third party engineering to evaluate acquisitions and year end reserves 
this provides an unbiased check against the company s internal evaluations 
employees and directors sign a code of business conduct and ethics which contains a whistle blower policy with an anonymous hotline to the audit committee chair so that fraud or violation of the company s policies can be reported immediately and appropriate action taken 
the board of directors for the company includes a majority of independent board members 
the audit and compensation committees are exclusively independent directors 
the board and the audit committee meet a minimum of once each quarter 
the audit committee meets regularly with the auditors in sessions where management is not present 
capital budget storm cat intends to announce its capital expenditure program in first quarter the budget will be funded primarily from the issuance of the series a and b notes  additional senior debt borrowings and cash flow from operations 
if the company cannot close on the series b notes because the underlying shares are not approved by shareholders  storm cat will have to seek alternative financing options or consider scaling back it proposed capital expenditure plans for the company may consider several options for raising additional funds such as selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar type arrangements 
financing obtained through the sale of storm cat equity will likely result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company continues to grow production and leasehold in its core prb operating area 
the prb provides opportunity for increased production as storm cat continues to successfully apply multi seam completion technology to its drilling operations  resulting in increasing cash flow for the company and its shareholders 
storm cat has successfully drilled five wells in elk valley which is a focused area to the company for future growth 
the fayetteville shale acquisition and cessford project are especially important  allowing the company to have access to data as a working interest partner in the wells with limited financial exposure 
storm cat will use this data to help refine its drilling program in these areas

if new project interests are acquired  the company will require additional funds for acquisition and exploration and or development of these new projects 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
the company does not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates in december  the company adopted the us dollar as its functional and reporting currency because the majority of its activity is conducted in us dollars 
the company believes this will facilitate a more direct comparison to other north american exploration and development companies 
prior to december  the company presented its financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in canada  and utilized the canadian dollar as its functional and reporting currency 
critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements include the company s estimate of the value of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve considerable judgment and are  or could be  affected by significant factors that are out of the company s control 
oil and gas reserves storm cat follows the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment would be recognized 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on the company because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the company s overall value 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of the company s proved properties 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of the company s wells have been producing less than five years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the company s estimates of proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as the company s wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be re determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from the company s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of the company s reserves 
for example a decrease in price of per mcf for natural gas would result in a decrease in the company s december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately million 
in addition  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
the company s reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of the company s unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
as of december   the company had fully impaired its mongolia property for a total of million 
its moose mountain property in canada was also impaired for a total of million 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from the sale of gas production from its producing wells 
this revenue is recognized as income when the production is produced and sold 
the company typically receives its payment for production sold one to three months subsequent to the month of the sale 
for this reason  the company must estimate the revenue that has been earned but not yet received as of the reporting date 
the company uses actual production reports to estimate the quantities sold and the colorado interstate gas cig spot price  less marketing and transportation adjustments  to estimate the price of the production 
variances between estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the month the payment is received 
stock based compensation the factors affecting stock based compensation include estimates of when stock options might be exercised and the stock price volatility 
the timing for exercise of options is out of the company s control and will depend  among other things  upon a variety of factors including the market value of company shares and the financial objectives of the holders of the options 
the company has used historical data to determine volatility in accordance with black scholes modeling  however  future volatility is inherently uncertain and the model has its limitations 
as of december  the company s black scholes model assumed a cumulative forfeiture rate of 
while these estimates can have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation expense  and hence results of operations  it has no impact on the company s financial condition 
accounting for oil and gas properties the company s recorded value of its oil and gas properties is  in all cases  based on historical costs 
the company is in an industry that is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties  including exploration risk  development risk  commodity price risk  operating risk  ownership and political risk  funding and currency risk as well as environmental risk 
the company s financial statements have been prepared with these risks in mind

the company recorded an unrealized gain of million from its derivative contracts for the year ended december   million of which was classified as a long term asset  and million of which was classified as a short term asset 
as of december   the company had entered into financial contracts through august for a total of approximately  mmbtu 
the company anticipates that all forecasted transactions will occur by the end of their originally specified periods 
all contracts are entered into for purposes other than trading 
on july   storm cat entered into a commodity swap cash settlement transaction 
the outstanding quantity committed to the swap as of december  is  mmbtu s per day beginning january  through july  the total quantity is  mmbtu s 
the fixed price in the agreement is per mmbtu cig pricing 
on august   storm cat entered into a second commodity swap cash settlement transaction 
the outstanding quantity committed to the second swap as of december  is  mmbtu s per day beginning january  through august  the total quantity is  mmbtu s 
the fixed price in the agreement is per mmbtu cig pricing 
on december   storm cat entered into two additional commodity swap cash settlement transactions 
the outstanding quantity committed to the third swap as of december  is  mmbtu s per day beginning january  through december  the total quantity is  mmbtu s 
the fixed price in the agreement is per mmbtu cig pricing 
the outstanding quantity committed to the fourth swap as of december  is  mmbtu s per day beginning january  through december  the total quantity is  mmbtu s

as of december   all natural gas derivative instruments qualified as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
the estimated fair value of natural gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was an unrealized gain of million as of december  realized gains or losses from the settlement of gas derivative contracts are reported in the total operating revenues section of the consolidated statements of operations 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in derivative loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company has minimized ineffectiveness by entering into gas derivative contracts indexed to cig 
as the company s derivative contracts contain the same index as the company s sale contracts  this results in hedges that are highly correlated with the underlying hedged item 
at the time of the filing of this report  storm cat had the following commodity swaps in place commodity period quarterly volume mmbtu fixed price per mmbtu natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas commodity period quarterly volume mmbtu fixed price per mmbtu natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to commodity period quarterly volume mmbtu fixed price per mmbtu natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to commodity period quarterly volume mmbtu fixed price per mmbtu natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to natural gas to the commodity swaps shown above were established in conjunction with the credit facility to allow the company access to the funds needed to explore and develop its existing acreage and to make acquisitions 
the swaps are hedged at cig rocky mountain prices 
a increase decrease in cig gas prices will result in a change of approximately million in the value of unrealized derivatives
