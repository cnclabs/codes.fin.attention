item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide human resource management services  comprised of staffing services and peo services 
we generate staffing services revenues primarily from short term staffing  contract staffing  on site management and direct placement services 
our peo service fees are generated from contractual agreements with our peo clients under which we become a co employer of our client s workforce with responsibility for some or all of the client s human resource functions 
we recognize revenues from our staffing services for all amounts invoiced  including direct payroll  employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
peo service fee revenues are recognized on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf no 

as such  our peo service fee revenues represent the gross margin generated from our peo services after deducting the amounts invoiced to peo customers for direct payroll expenses such as salaries  wages  health insurance and employee out of pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment 
these amounts are also excluded from cost of revenues 
peo service fees also include amounts invoiced to our clients for employer payroll related taxes and workers compensation coverage 
through centralized operations at our headquarters in vancouver  washington  we prepare invoices weekly for our staffing services customers and following the end of each payroll processing cycle for peo clients 
we invoice our customers and clients as each payroll is processed 
payment terms for staffing customers are generally days  while peo clients invoices are generally due on the invoice date 
our business is concentrated in california and oregon and we expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from these markets in the future 
revenues generated in our california and oregon offices accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in consequently  any weakness in economic conditions or changes in the regulatory environments in these regions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we offer cash safety incentives to certain peo clients for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the cash incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the safety incentive expense is also netted against peo revenues on our statements of operations 
our cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs for staffing services  employer payroll related taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal unemployment taxes  state unemployment taxes and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with our self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state administrative agency fees and excess insurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
we also maintain separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where we are not self insured 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to us  our respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and their professional judgment 
we then record or accrue an expense and a corresponding liability based upon our estimate of the ultimate claim cost 
as cash payments are made by our tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
we have established an additional reserve for both future unanticipated increases in costs adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
we believe our operational policies and internal claims reporting system help to limit the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  depreciation and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  depreciation  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive compensation 
amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of software costs  and covenants not to compete  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to ten years 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
self insured workers compensation reserves 
we are self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of our employee work sites in oregon  california  maryland and delaware and for staffing services only in washington 
the estimated liability for unsettled workers compensation claims represents our best estimate  which includes an evaluation of information provided by our third party administrators for workers compensation claims and  in part  an annual actuarial analysis from an independent actuary 
included in the claims liabilities are case reserve estimates for reported losses  plus additional amounts based on projections for incurred but not reported claims  anticipated increases in case reserve estimates and additional claims administration expenses 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments to liabilities are reflected in current operating results as they become known 
we believe that the difference between amounts recorded for our estimated liabilities and the possible range of costs to settle related claims is not material to results of operations  nevertheless  it is reasonably possible that adjustments required in future periods may be material to results of operations 
safety incentives liability 
our accrued safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensating claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the liability is estimated and accrued each month based upon the then current amount of the customer s estimated workers compensation claims reserves as established by the company s third party administrator 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill indicates there was no impairment as of december  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets  as of the date of our annual assessment on december recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their potential effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  refer to note in the notes to the financial statements beginning at page f of this annual report on form k

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by selected items in the company s statements of operations for the years ended december   and  included in item of this report 
references to the notes to financial statements appearing below are to the notes to the company s financial statements included in item of this report 
percentage of total net revenues years ended december  revenues staffing services professional employer service fees total cost of revenues direct payroll costs payroll taxes and benefits workers compensation total gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations other income expense pretax income provision for income taxes net income we report peo revenues in accordance with the requirements of eitf no 
which requires us to report such revenues on a net basis because we are not the primary obligor for the services provided by our peo clients to their customers pursuant to our peo contracts 
we present for comparison purposes the gross revenues and cost of revenues information for the years ended december  and set forth in the table below 
although not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management believes this information is more informative as to the level of our business activity and more illustrative of how we manage our operations  including the preparation of our internal operating forecasts  because it presents our peo services on a basis comparable to our staffing services 
year ended december  in thousands revenues staffing services professional employer services total revenues cost of revenues direct payroll costs payroll taxes and benefits workers compensation total cost of revenues gross margin a reconciliation of non gaap gross revenues to net revenues is as follows for the years ended december  and in thousands gross revenue net revenue reporting method reclassification reporting method revenues staffing services professional employer services total revenues cost of revenues years ended december  and net income for amounted to million  an improvement of or million over net income of million for the improvement for was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars as a result of significant growth in our peo business  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
diluted earnings per share for was compared to for the percentage increase in net income for exceeded the increase in diluted earnings per share due to the dilutive effect of our follow on offering of common stock completed in early august the company s improved operating results continue to reflect  in part  growing market acceptance of the business process outsourcing model  market share gains owing to strong branch level management and the competitive advantage of offering a broad array of human resource management services through its peo arrangements 
the trend toward normalization of market conditions for california workers compensation insurance initiated by limited legislative reforms over the past few years has had little effect on our peo growth rates due to the increasing market acceptance of our broad array of human resource management services 
we expect this favorable trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
revenues for totaled million  an increase of approximately million or  which reflects significant growth in the company s peo service fee revenue  partially offset by a small decline in staffing services revenue 
peo service fee revenue increased approximately million or over primarily due to increased demand for the company s broad array of competitively priced human resource management services that satisfy customers needs and to the incremental fee revenue generated by the january  acquisition of pro hr  which represented million or of the total increase 
at december   the company had approximately  peo clients as compared to approximately peo clients at december  management believes that the favorable trend in peo revenues will continue for the foreseeable future 
staffing services revenue declined approximately million or from during  the company served approximately  staffing services customers  which compares to approximately  customers during the decrease in staffing services revenues reflects decreased business activity with certain customers owing to their size of operation  as well as customers whose demand for the company s services declined 
management expects demand for the company s staffing services will continue to reflect overall economic conditions in its market areas 
gross margin for totaled approximately million  which represented an increase of million or over  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
the gross margin percent increased from of revenues for to for the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower direct payroll costs and lower workers compensation expense  offset in part by higher payroll taxes and benefits  all expressed as a percent of revenues 
the decline in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for reflects the shift in the overall mix of services from staffing services to peo services in the company s customer base and the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
workers compensation expense  as a percent of revenues  declined from in to in workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for the moderate increase in workers compensation expense in total dollars was generally due to higher administrative costs of the company s self insured workers compensation program offset in part by lower overall claim costs due to a lower claim incidence rate  which reflects the company s underwriting standards and risk management practices 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for  was largely due to the effect of significant growth in peo services  offset in part by slightly lower effective state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates as compared to we expect gross margin as a percentage of total revenues to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as the adequacy of our estimates for workers compensation liabilities 
in connection with our self insured workers compensation program  we have maintained an excess workers compensation policy that limits the financial effect of costly workers compensation claims 
effective january   the self insured retention or deductible was million per occurrence and remained as such through  with a moderate decline in the premium cost per of payroll 
effective january   the company incorporated a wholly owned fully licensed captive insurance company  which will participate in providing bbsi with excess workers compensation and other insurance coverages 
management expects the captive insurance company will provide cost effective opportunities to participate in more competitive insurance markets and provide additional flexibility in risk management 
including our captive insurance company ie  on a consolidated basis our self insured retention is million per occurrence  effective january  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of our headquarters and our branch offices and the marketing of our services 
sg a for amounted to approximately million  an increase of million or over the increase over was primarily attributable to increases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of growth in the company s peo business and to the incremental sg a expenses associated with the pro hr acquisition  which represented million or of the increase 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the grant date fair value of all share based payment awards  including employee stock options  to be recorded as employee compensation expense over the requisite service period 
we applied the modified prospective transition method when we adopted sfas r and  therefore  did not restate any prior periods 
effective with the close of business on december   the company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options to eliminate future compensation expense associated with those options under sfas r 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  during  we recorded no incremental compensation expense as a result of adopting sfas r 
if we had accounted for our share based payment awards under sfas r during  our compensation expense would have been approximately million higher 
the company has not determined if it will grant future awards under its stock incentive plan 
for additional information about the adoption of sfas r  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
other income for was million compared to other income of  for the increase in other income for was primarily attributable to increased investment income earned on the company s higher cash balances 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for  which compares to million for the increase in the depreciation and amortization expense level compared to was primarily due to a full year of depreciation expense on the company owned building housing the corporate headquarters acquired in september our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the lower effective rate was primarily attributable to a significant increase in federal tax exempt interest income 
at december   we had net deferred income tax assets of million  which consist of temporary differences between taxable income for financial accounting and tax purposes  which will reduce taxable income in future years 
pursuant to gaap  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred income tax assets as significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during future periods 
although realization is not assured  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred income tax assets will be realized  principally based upon projected taxable income for the next two years 
the amount of the net deferred income tax assets actually realized could vary  if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred income tax assets or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income as compared to operating forecasts 
if our operating forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions  our long term forecast may require reassessment 
as a result  in the future  a valuation allowance may be required to be established for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax assets 
such a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to million  an improvement of or million over net income of million for the improvement for was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars as a result of significant growth in peo services business  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
diluted earnings per share for was compared to 
for revenues for totaled million  an increase of approximately million or  which reflects significant growth in the company s peo service fee revenue  combined with a increase in staffing services revenue 
peo service fee revenue increased approximately million or over primarily due to increased demand for the company s broad array of competitively priced human resource management services 
at december   the company had approximately peo clients as compared to approximately peo clients at december  staffing services revenue increased approximately million or over during  the company served approximately  staffing services customers  which compares to approximately the same number of customers during although the number of customers remained at a similar level in as compared to  the increase in staffing services revenues reflects increased business activity with certain customers owing to their size of operation  as well as customers whose demand for the company s services increased 
gross margin for totaled approximately million  which represented an increase of million or over  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
the gross margin percent increased from of revenues for to for the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower direct payroll costs and lower workers compensation expense  offset in part by higher payroll taxes and benefits  all expressed as a percent of revenues

depreciation and amortization totaled million for  which compares to a similar amount for the depreciation and amortization expense level remained relatively comparable to amounts due to a low level of capital expenditures for operations 
our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the lower effective rate was primarily attributable to a significant increase in federal tax exempt interest income 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as wage limits on statutory payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand for our services and competition 
payroll taxes  as a component of cost of revenues  generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and social security taxes are exceeded on a per employee basis 
our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers businesses in the agriculture  food processing and forest products related industries 
in addition  revenues in the fourth quarter may be affected by many customers practice of operating on holiday shortened schedules 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims 
in addition  adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the company s estimated workers compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of million at december   increased by million over december   which compares to an increase of million for the comparable period in the increase in cash at december   as compared to december   was primarily generated from net income  offset in part by cash used for the acquisition of pro hr  llc and cash used for purchases of property and equipment

the remaining uses of cash for investing activities were purchases of restricted marketable securities of million  offset by proceeds totaling million from maturities of restricted marketable securities 
the transactions related to restricted marketable securities were scheduled maturities and the related replacement of such securities held for workers compensation surety deposit purposes 
the company presently has no material long term capital commitments 
net cash used in financing activities for was  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for for  the principal uses of cash for financing activities were for payments made on long term debt of million and a cash dividend of  paid to holders of the company s common stock  offset in part by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits totaling million 
for  the principal source of cash from financing activities was million in net proceeds from the company s follow on offering of common stock completed in early august as disclosed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company acquired certain assets of pro hr  llc  a privately held peo company with offices in boise and rexburg  idaho and grand junction  colorado  effective january  the company paid million in cash on the effective date for the assets of pro hr and the selling shareholders non compete agreements and agreed to pay up to million additional cash based upon the level of financial performance achieved by the pro hr offices during calendar effective october   the company paid million in cash in partial satisfaction of the contingent consideration of this acquisition 
this partial payment of the contingent consideration was based upon the financial performance of pro hr for the first six months of the remaining  of contingent consideration was held in escrow and is included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  subsequent to december   the company performed a second evaluation of the financial performance criteria and determined pro hr had met such performance criteria for the full year 
the remaining contingent consideration of  was paid in february the company s business strategy continues to focus on growth through the expansion of operations at existing offices  together with the selective acquisition of additional personnel related business  both in its existing markets and other strategic geographic markets 
the company periodically evaluates proposals for various acquisition opportunities  but there can be no assurance that any additional transactions will be consummated 
the company entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with its principal bank effective july  the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to million  which includes a subfeature under the line of credit for standby letters of credit up to million 
the interest rate on advances  if any  will be  at the company s discretion  either i equal to the prime rate or ii libor plus 
the credit agreement expires july  management anticipates that if it chooses to renew the credit agreement  such terms and conditions for a new agreement will not be less favorable than the current agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company is required to maintain compliance with the following covenants net income after taxes not less than one dollar on an annual basis  determined as of each fiscal year end  and pre tax profit of not less than one dollar on a quarterly basis  determined as of each fiscal quarter end 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  effective november   the company s board of directors approved management s recommendation to discontinue certain business insurance policies 
such policies  in the aggregate  required annual premiums of approximately  and provided insured limits ranging from the relatively small value of personal property in the company s branch offices to million general liability coverage with umbrella coverage of an additional million 
it is the company s determination that the risk of loss under such prior insurance policies is remote  therefore  the company became self insured for such risks effective november   except for its errors and omissions insurance coverage which was cancelled effective december  management may explore in the future more cost effective vehicles to provide higher limits of coverage  as well as coverages provided by the company s newly incorporated captive insurance company 
management expects that current liquid assets  coupled with the funds anticipated to be generated from operations and credit available under the credit agreement will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december   including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and long term workers compensation liabilities  are summarized below payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases long term workers compensation claims liabilities for catastrophic injuries total contractual cash obligations inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to its investment portfolio of liquid assets 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted principally of approximately million in tax exempt municipal bonds with an average maturity of days  million in a tax exempt money market fund and approximately million in bond funds and corporate bonds 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio of liquid assets or its results of operations
