the following discussion of the company s services should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank services as a state chartered commercial bank  united security bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in fresno  madera  and kern counties 
the bank will also offer a full range of banking services in santa clara county with its recent purchase of legacy bank in campbell  california 
the bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts  interest bearing negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market accounts and time certificates of deposit 
most of the bank s deposits are attracted from individuals and from small and medium sized business related sources 
the bank also engages in a full complement of lending activities  including real estate mortgage  commercial and industrial  real estate construction  as well as agricultural  lease financing  and consumer loans  with particular emphasis on short and medium term obligations 
the bank s loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry  although approximately of the bank s loans are secured by real estate 
a loan may be secured in whole or in part by real estate even though the purpose of the loan is not to facilitate the purchase or development of real estate 
at december   the bank had loans net of unearned fees outstanding of million  which represented approximately of the bank s total deposits and approximately of its total assets 
real estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property 
repayment of real estate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification 
loans may be originated in the company s market area  or participated with other financial institutions outside the company s market area 
a substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  leases or other collateral 
the remainder are unsecured  however extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the borrower to repay the extension of credit 
repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential contractors  which are secured by single family residential properties 
all real estate loans have established equity requirements 
repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long term mortgages with other lending institutions 
agricultural loans are generally secured by land  equipment  inventory and receivables

at december  and  loan commitments and letters of credit of the bank aggregated million and million  respectively 
of the million in loan commitments outstanding at december   million or were for loans with maturities of one year or less 
due to the nature of the business of the bank s customers  there are no seasonal patterns or absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments  therefore the bank is unable to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be exercised within the current year 
the bank does not believe that any such utilization will constitute a material liquidity demand 
in addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above  the bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders 
these services include online banking  safe deposit boxes  atm services  payroll direct deposit  cashier s checks  traveler s checks  money orders  and foreign drafts 
the bank does not operate a trust department  however  it makes arrangements with its correspondent bank to offer trust services to its customers on request 
most of the bank s business originates within fresno  madera  and kern counties 
neither the bank s business or liquidity is seasonal  and there has been no material effect upon the bank s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position as a result of federal  state or local environmental regulation 
competition and market share the banking business in california generally  and in the market area served by the company specifically  is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits 
the company competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions and other financial institutions  including a number that are substantially larger than the company 
deregulation of the banking industry  increased competition from non bank entities for the cash balances of individuals and businesses  and continuing developments in the computer and communications industries have had  and most likely will continue to have  a significant impact on the company s competitive position 
with the enactment of interstate banking legislation in california  bank holding companies headquartered outside of california will continue to enter the california market and provide competition for the company 
additionally  with the gramm leach bliley act of  traditional competitive barriers between insurance companies  securities underwriters  and commercial banks have been eased  allowing a greater number of financial intermediaries to offer a wider assortment of financial services 
many of the major commercial banks operating in the company s market areas offer certain services such as trust and international banking services  which the company does not offer directly 
in addition  banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers 
the company s primary market area at december  was located in fresno  madera  and kern counties  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business 
santa clara county has been added during with the legacy bank acquisition  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business 
the following table sets forth information regarding deposit market share and ranking by county as of june   which is the most current information available 
rank share fresno county th madera county th kern county th total of fresno  madera  kern counties th santa clara county th supervision and regulation the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act  and is registered as such with the frb 
a bank holding company is required to file with the frb annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries and is also subject to examination by the frb 
the bhc act requires  among other things  prior approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank 
the bhc act also provides that the frb shall not approve any acquisition that would result in or further the creation of a monopoly  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served 
furthermore  under the bhc act  a bank holding company is  with limited exceptions  prohibited from i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or ii engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks 
with the prior approval of the frb  however  a bank holding company may own shares of a company engaged in activities which the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto 
the bhc act requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting a subsidiary bank 
under certain conditions  the frb may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company  such as payment of cash dividends  would constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices because they violate the frb s source of strength doctrine 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a promise by its customer to obtain other services by it  its holding company or other subsidiaries  or on a promise by its customer not to obtain services from a competitor 
in addition  federal law imposes certain restrictions between the company and its subsidiaries  including the bank 
as an affiliate of the bank  the company is subject  with certain exceptions  to provisions of federal law imposing limitations on  and requiring collateral for  extensions of credit by the bank to its affiliates 
in the gramm leach bliley act the glba was enacted 
the glba became effective in march of and is a financial services modernization law that  among other things  facilitates broad new affiliations among securities firms  insurance companies and bank holding companies by repealing the year old provisions of the glass steagall act 
the glba allows the formation of financial holding companies fhc s  which are bank holding companies with substantially expanded powers 
a bank holding company must acquire the approval of the frb to become a fhc 
under these expanded powers  affiliations may occur between bank holding companies  securities firms and insurance companies  subject to a blend of umbrella supervision and regulation of the newly formed consolidated entity by the federal reserve  oversight of the fhc s bank and thrift subsidiaries by their primary federal and state banking regulators and financial regulation of the fhc s nonbank subsidiaries by their respective specialized regulators 
the company has not applied to become a fhc 
as a public company  united security bancshares is subject to the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act amends the securities and exchange act of  and is intended to protect investors by  among other things  improving the reliability of financial reporting  increasing management accountability  and increasing the independence of directors and the company s external accountants see recent legislation and other changes 
the company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which include but are not limited to the filing of annual  quarterly and other current reports with the sec 
the bank the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions 
in addition  the bank is also a member of the federal reserve system and  as such  is subject to applicable provisions of the federal reserve act and regulations issued thereunder and  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the federal reserve bank 
the bank is subject to california law  insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law 
deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic up to the applicable limits in an amount up to  per customer  and  as such  the bank is subject to the regulations of the fdic and the federal deposit insurance act 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in california and the united states  the bank s business is particularly susceptible to changes in california and federal legislation and regulation  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting permissible activities or increasing competition 
various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of california affect the operations of the bank 
federal and california statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including capital requirements and disclosure requirements to depositors and borrowers  requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  limitations on interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  and restrictions on borrowings and on payment of dividends 
the dfi regulates the number and location of branch offices of a state chartered bank  and may permit a bank to maintain branches only to the extent allowable under state law for state banks 
california law presently permits a bank to locate a branch in any locality in the state 
additionally  california law exempts banks from california usury laws 
effect of governmental policies and recent legislation banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the company s portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including  but not limited to  inflation  recession and unemployment 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact that future changes in fiscal or monetary policies or economic controls may have on the company s business and earnings cannot be predicted 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting the company s net income 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the company is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted recently and other which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below 
recent legislation and other changes federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time  and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time 
the following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking 
on february   the president signed the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act into law 
the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of  which the president signed into law on february   contains necessary technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform  as well as a number of study and survey requirements 
the reform act provides for the following changes merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund  the deposit insurance fund dif 
this change was made effective march  increasing the coverage limit for retirement accounts to  and indexing the coverage limit for retirement accounts to inflation as with the general deposit insurance coverage limit 
this change was made effective april  establishing a range of percent to percent within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio drr 
allowing the fdic to manage the pace at which the reserve ratio varies within this range 
if the reserve ratio falls below percent or is expected to within months the fdic must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the dif will return to percent generally within years 
if the reserve ratio exceeds percent  the fdic must generally dividend to dif members half of the amount above the amount necessary to maintain the dif at percent  unless the fdic board  considering statutory factors  suspends the dividends 
if the reserve ratio exceeds percent  the fdic must generally dividend to dif members all amounts above the amount necessary to maintain the dif at percent 
eliminating the restrictions on premium rates based on the drr and granting the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 
granting a one time initial assessment credit of approximately billion to recognize institutions past contributions to the fund 
the federal reserve board in february approved a final rule that expands the definition of a small bank holding company under its small bank holding company policy statement and the board s risk based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
the policy statement facilitates the transfer of ownership of small community banks by permitting debt levels at small bank holding companies that are higher than what would typically be permitted for larger small bank holding companies 
in its revisions to the policy statement  the federal reserve board has raised the small bank holding company asset size threshold from million to million and amended the related qualitative criteria for determining eligibility as a small bank holding company for the purposes of the policy statement and the capital guidelines 
the fdic finalized its interim final rule  with changes  that amended its deposit insurance regulations to implement applicable revisions to the federal deposit insurance act made by the federal deposit insurance reform act of and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of the final rule provides for consideration of inflation adjustments to increase the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount of  on a five year cycle beginning in  increases the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement accounts from  to  also subject to inflation adjustments  and provides per participant insurance coverage to employee benefit plan accounts  even if the depository institution at which the deposits are placed is not authorized to accept employee benefit plan deposits 
the final rule is effective on october  the board of governors of the federal reserve system amended regulation e  which implements the electronic fund transfer act  and the official staff commentary to the regulation  which interprets the requirements of regulation e to become effective on july  the final rule provides that regulation e covers payroll card accounts that are established directly or indirectly through an employer  and to which transfers of the consumer s salary  wages  or other employee compensation are made on a recurring basis 
the final rule also provides financial institutions with an alternative to providing periodic statements for payroll card accounts if they make account information available to consumers by specified means 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in september issued final guidance to address the risks posed by nontraditional residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes interest  including interest only mortgages and payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
these products allow borrowers to exchange lower payments during an initial period for higher payments later 
the lack of principal amortization and the potential for negative amortization and features that compound risks such as no document loans and simultaneous second mortgages elevate the concern of the federal banking agencies for nontraditional mortgage products 
the guidelines require depository institutions to ensure that loan terms and underwriting standards are consistent with prudent lending practices  including consideration of a borrower s repayment capacity  to recognize that many nontraditional mortgage loans  particularly when they have risk layering features  are untested in a stressed environment 
the guidelines also express the need for depository institutions to have strong risk management standards  capital levels commensurate with the risk  an allowance for loan and lease losses that reflects the collectibility of the portfolio  and the need to make sure that consumers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making a product or payment choice 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and the federal deposit insurance corporation in december issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the agencies observed that the commercial real estate is an area in which some banks are becoming increasingly concentrated  especially with small to medium sized banks that face strong competition in their other business lines 
the agencies support banks serving a vital role in their communities by supplying credit for business and real estate development 
however  the agencies are concerned that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny  but such criteria are not limits on commercial real estate lending 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the alll 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement has also been revised to conform to generally accepted accounting principles gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement described the responsibilities of the boards of directors  management  and banking examiners regarding the alll  factors to be considered in the estimation of the alll  and the objectives and elements of an effective loan review system  including a sound credit grading system 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an alll at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
in california  effective january   a new law financial code section recognizes the ability of mortgage brokers to obtain the benefit of non interest bearing accounts on trust funds deposited in a commercial bank 
the provision applies to real estate brokers who collect payments or provide services in connection with a loan secured by a lien on real property and permits a mortgage broker to earn interest on an interest bearing account at a financial institution 
interest on funds received by a real estate broker who collects payments or provides services for an institutional investor in connection with a loan secured by commercial real property may inure to the broker  if agreed to in writing by the broker and the institutional investor 
for purposes of this law  commercial real property means real estate improved with other than a one to four family residence 
a new california law makes it easier for california banks to accept deposits from local government agencies 
under the old law  local agency deposits over  had to be secured by collateral 
pursuant to the enactment of assembly bill  banks would be able to acquire surplus public deposits exceeding  without pledging collateral if they participate in a deposit placement service where excess amounts are placed in certificates of deposit at other institutions within a network 
such a network of which currently there is only one available in the market permits the entire amount of a customer s deposit to be fdic insured  and the bank taking the original deposit retains the benefit of the full amount of the deposit for lending or other purposes 
ab clarifies that a local agency may deposit up to of its surplus funds in certificates of deposit at a bank  savings association  savings bank  or credit union that participates in such a deposit sharing network 
since the entire amount of the deposits would be fdic insured  a bank would not be required to pledge collateral 
the bill permits agencies to make these deposits until january  the federal reserve board in november approved amendments to regulation cc that define remotely created checks and create transfer and presentment warranties that shift liability for an unauthorized remotely created check to the institution where it is first deposited 
in place of a signature  a remotely created check generally bears a statement that the customer authorized the check or bears the customer s printed or typed name  such as when a debtor authorizes a credit card company to create a remotely created check by telephone so that the debtor may pay a credit card bill in a timely manner 
since the remotely created checks are vulnerable to fraud regulation cc creates transfer and presentment warranties under which any bank that transfers or presents a remotely created check would warrant that the check is authorized by the person on whose account the check is drawn 
the warranties would apply only to banks and would ultimately shift liability for losses attributable to an unauthorized remotely created check to the depositary bank 
these amendments would not affect the rights of checking account customers  as they are not liable for unauthorized checks drawn on their accounts 
the amendments to regulation cc become effective on july  on august   the occ  fdic  and the board of governors of the federal reserve system adopted a final rule to revise their community reinvestment act cra regulations 
the effective date of the final rule is september  major points of the final rule include increasing the asset size threshold for a small bank to billion 
small banks are not subject to certain data collection and reporting requirements and are eligible for evaluation under the small bank lending test 
creating a new category of intermediate small banks for purposes of evaluation under the cra 
intermediate small banks are those with at least million but less than billion in assets 
the overall cra rating for an intermediate small bank will be based both on the rating from the small bank lending test and the rating from a new community development test 
revising the definition of community development to increase the number and kinds of rural tracts in which bank activities are eligible for community development consideration 
revising the regulation to address the impact on a bank s cra rating of evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices 
in may  the frb adopted a final rule to amend regulation dd and the related official staff interpretations  to improve the uniformity and adequacy of information to consumers about certain services provided by banks to their deposit customers 
these services are commonly referred to as bounced check protection or courtesy overdraft protection services overdraft services 
these amendments become effective on july  these amendments require banks to disclose information about overdraft fees on periodic statements and account opening disclosures  and to include certain disclosures in advertisements for overdraft services 
regulation dd generally requires that banks disclose the amount of any fee that may be imposed in connection with the account and the conditions under which a fee may be imposed 
the final rule amends the official staff interpretations to state that  in satisfying this requirement with respect to fees for overdraft services  a bank must specify the categories of transactions for which an overdraft fee may be imposed 
the federal reserve board issued a final rule on march  that amends regulation h and regulation y to limit restricted core capital elements including trust preferred securities which count as tier capital to percent of all core capital elements  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
internationally active bank holding companies  defined as those with consolidated assets greater than billion or on balance sheet foreign exposure greater than billion  will be subject to a percent limit  but they may include qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the generally applicable percent limit 
amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits generally may be included in tier capital 
the final rule provides a five year transition period  ending march   for application of the quantitative limits 
during july  president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the purpose of the sarbanes oxley act is to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws  and for other purposes 
the sarbanes oxley act amends the securities exchange act of to prohibit a registered public accounting firm from performing specified nonaudit services contemporaneously with a mandatory audit 
the sarbanes oxley act also vests the audit committee of an issuer with responsibility for the appointment  compensation  and oversight of any registered public accounting firm employed to perform audit services 
it requires each committee member to be a member of the board of directors of the issuer  and to be otherwise independent 
the sarbanes oxley act further requires the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of an issuer to make certain certifications as to each annual or quarterly report filed with the sec 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act requires officers to forfeit certain bonuses and profits under certain circumstances 
specifically  if an issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the issuer as a result of misconduct with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the issuer shall be required to reimburse the issuer for any bonus or other incentive based or equity based compensation received by that person from the issuer during the month period following the first public issuance or filing with the sec of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement  and any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer during that month period 
the sarbanes oxley act also instructs the sec to require by rule disclosure of all material off balance sheet transactions and relationships that may have a material effect upon the financial status of an issuer  and the presentation of non gaap pro forma financial information in a manner that is not misleading  and which is reconcilable with the financial condition of the issuer under generally accepted accounting principles

risk factors there are risk factors that may affect the company s business and impact the results of operations  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s financial performance is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s operations are greatly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
deposit flows and the funding costs are influenced by interest rates of competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and by other factors affecting the availability of funds 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received from interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  management seeks to manage the balances of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintain appropriate maturity and repricing parameters for these assets and liabilities 
a mismatch between the amount of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities in any time period may expose the company to interest rate risk 
generally  if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin will be positively impacted during a rising rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining rate environment 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin will generally be positively impacted during a declining rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising rate environment 
increases in the level of interest rates may reduce the overall level of loans originated by the company  and  thus  the amount of loan and commitment fees earned  as well as the market value of investment securities and other interest earning assets 
moreover  fluctuations in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investments  such as corporate securities and other investment vehicles which  because of the absence of federal deposit insurance  generally pay higher rates of return than depository institutions 
the deterioration of local economic conditions in the company s market area could hurt profitability 
the company s operations are located primarily in fresno  madera  and kern counties and are concentrated in fresno county and surrounding areas 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
the local economy in the company s market areas rely heavily on agriculture  real estate  professional and business services  manufacturing  trade and tourism 
a significant economic downturn such as that experienced after the september  tragedy in any or all of these industries could result in a decline in the local economy in general  which could in turn negatively impact the company s operations and financial condition 
poor economic conditions could cause the company to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in the loan portfolio 
concentrations in commercial and industrial loans  real estate secured commercial loans  and real estate construction loans  may expose the company to increased lending risks  especially in the event of a recession 
the company has significant concentrations in commercial real estate and real estate construction loans 
as of december    and of the company s loan portfolio was concentrated in these two categories  respectively 
in addition  the company has many commercial loans to businesses in the construction and real estate industry 
there has been a relatively rapid increase in real estate values in the company s market area in recent years  and the occurrence of a real estate recession affecting these market areas would likely reduce the security for many of the company s loans and adversely affect the ability of many of borrowers to repay loan balances due the company and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
therefore  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by a decline in the value of the real estate securing the company s loans 
the company faces strong competition  which may adversely affect its operating results 
in recent years  competition for bank customers  the source of deposits and loans for the company  has greatly intensified 
this competition includes larger regional and national banks and other fdic insured depository institutions in many of the communities the company serves  finance companies  investment banking and brokerage firms  and insurance companies that offer bank like products  credit unions  which can offer highly competitive rates on loans and deposits because they receive tax advantages not available to commercial banks  and technology based financial institutions including large national and super regional banks offering on line deposit  bill payment  and mortgage loan application services 
some of the financial services organizations with which the company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured financial institutions 
as a result  these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over the company in accessing funding and in providing various banking related services 
by virtue of their larger capital position  regional and national banks have substantially larger lending limits than the company  and can provide certain services to their customers which the company is not able to offer directly  such as trust and international services 
many of these larger banks also operate with greater economies of scale which result in lower operating costs than the company on a per unit basis 
other existing single or multi branch community banks  or new community bank start ups  have marketing strategies similar to united security bancshares 
these other community banks can open new branches in the communities the company serves and compete directly for customers who want the high level of service community banks offer 
other community banks also compete for the same management personnel and the same potential acquisition and merger candidates 
ultimately  competition can drive down the company s interest margins and reduce profitability  as well as make it more difficult for the company to achieve its growth objectives 
the company s growth and expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and as a result  its market value and profitability may suffer 
the company plans to grow operations within its market area and expand into new market areas when it makes strategic business sense  however the company s capacity to manage any such growth will depend primarily on the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  monitor operations  maintain earnings and control costs 
the company expects to continue to grow its assets and deposits  the products and services which it offers and accordingly the scale of its operations 
the company s ability to manage growth successfully will depend on the ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms 
if the company grows too quickly and is not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  this rapid growth could materially adversely affect the financial performance of the company 
the future successful growth of the company will depend on the ability of its officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve operational  credit  financial  management and other internal risk controls and processes  reporting systems and procedures  and to manage a growing number of customer relationships 
the company may not successfully implement improvements to management information and control systems  and control procedures and processes  in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
in particular  the company s controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in expected loan volume and the infrastructure that comes with growth 
thus  the company s growth strategy may divert management from existing businesses and may require the company to incur additional expenditures to expand its administrative and operational infrastructure 
if the company is unable to manage future expansion in its operations  it may experience compliance and operational problems  need to slow the pace of growth  or need to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth  any one of which could adversely affect the company s business and profitability 
the loss of any of the company s executive officers or key personnel could be damaging to the business 
the company depends upon the skills and reputations of its executive officers and key employees for its future success 
the loss of any of these key persons or the inability to attract and retain other key personnel could adversely affect the company s business operations 
the company could experience loan losses  which exceed the overall allowance for loan losses 
the risk of credit losses on loans and leases varies with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  and  in the case of collateralized loans  the value and marketability of the collateral 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon  among other things  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions  and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and determinations about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans where their collectibility is considered to be questionable 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was approximately million representing of gross outstanding loans 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  there can be no absolute assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
although the company uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used or if negative developments occur with respect to non performing or performing loans 
if management s assumptions or conclusions prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses  or if company s regulatory agencies require an increase in the allowance for loan losses  the company s earnings  and potentially its capital  could be significantly and adversely impacted 
the company may become subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the company may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the regulatory environment under which the company operates may have an adverse impact on the banking industry 
the company is subject to extensive regulatory supervision and oversight from both federal and state authorities 
regulatory oversight of the company is provided by the federal reserve bank frb and the california department of financial institutions dfi 
future legislation and government may adversely impact the company and the commercial banking industry in general 
future regulatory changes may also alter the structure and competitive relationship among financial institutions 
the company may be exposed to compliance risk resulting from violations or nonconformity with laws  rules  regulations  internal policies and procedures  or ethical standards set forth by regulatory authorities 
the company may also be subject to compliance risk in situations where laws or rules governing certain products or activities of the company s customers may be uncertain or untested 
compliance risk exposes the company to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages  and the potential voiding of contracts 
compliance risk can result in diminished reputation  reduced franchise value  limited business opportunities  and reduced growth potential 
if the company lost a significant portion of its low cost core deposits  it would negatively impact profitability 
the company s profitability depends in part on its success in attracting and retaining a stable base of low cost deposits 
as of december   noninterest bearing checking accounts comprised of the company s deposit base  and interest bearing checking and money market accounts comprised an additional and  respectively 
the company considers these deposits to be core deposits 
if the company lost a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively impact its profitability and long term growth objectives 
while management generally does not believe these deposits are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  the competition for these deposits in the company s market area is strong and if the company were to lose a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively affect business operations 
the company s internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based  in part  on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures  interruptions or security breaches or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the company s information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company continually encounters technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the company s operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to the company s customers and even if such products and services are implemented  the company may incur substantial costs in doing so 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations the company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue 
united security bancshares is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
the company receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary  united security bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on common stock and interest on the company s junior subordinated debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that united security bank and certain non bank subsidiaries may pay to united security bancshares 
also  united security bancshares right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event united security bank is unable to pay dividends to united security bancshares  the company may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from united security bank could have a material adverse effect on united security bancshares business  financial condition and results of operations 
the holders of the company s junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of the company s shareholders 
on june   the company issued million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by its subsidiary  united security bancshares capital trust i 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in july the company conditionally guarantees payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
the company s junior subordinated debentures are senior to holders of common stock 
as a result  the company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
the company has the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company s business 
severe weather  natural disasters  including but not limited to earthquakes and droughts  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause the company to incur additional expenses 
severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures  and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of this financial review 
if the loan portfolio were to increase by proportionally throughout all loan classifications  the additional estimated provision to the allowance that would be required  based on the percentage loss allocations utilized at december   would be approximately  pretax  net of tax 
this estimate is comprised of an additional   net of tax for criticized loans those classified as special mention or worse and excluding those considered impaired under sfas no 
 and an additional   net of tax for the remainder of the loan portfolio that is performing 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at the lower of the book value of the loan  or fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell 
the excess  if any  of the loan amount over the fair value is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned  along with related revenue and expenses from operations  are charged to noninterest expense 
the fair market valuation of such properties is based upon estimates  and as such  is subject to change as circumstances in the company s market area  or general economic trends  change 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
the acquisition of taft national bank during april gave rise to goodwill totaling approximately  and the recent acquisition of legacy bank will result in goodwill related to the transaction  the amount of which has not yet been determined 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
if the company s future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the deferred tax asset may not be realized and the company s income will be reduced 
on december  the california franchise tax board ftb announced certain tax transactions related to real estate investment trusts reits and regulated investment companies rics will be disallowed pursuant to senate bill and assembly bill  which were signed into law in the th quarter of as a result  the company reversed related net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of and took no such benefit in the th quarter 
the company continues to review the information available from the ftb and its financial advisors and believes that the company s position has merit 
the company will pursue its tax claims and defend its use of these entities and transactions 
at this time  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome 
if the ftb were to prevail against the company in its defense of tax benefits taken during  the negative effect to net income would be approximately  excluding any possible penalties and interest 
during the first quarter of  the ftb notified the company of its intent to audit the reit for the tax years ended december and the company has retained legal counsel to represent it in the tax audit 
the ftb concluded its audit during january at that time the ftb submitted a closing letter to the company  which included proposed assessments related to the tax benefits taken for the reit during see further discussion see note  taxes on income contained in item of this form k

and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the company adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method during the first quarter of sfas no 
r requires the company to recognize as compensation expense  the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors of the company beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the pretax compensation expense recognized during totaled  impairment of investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale afs are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
securities classified as afs or held to maturity htm are subject to review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value  whether the decline is related to a credit event or to a change in interest rate  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
at december   the company did not have any investment securities considered other than temporarily impaired 
revenue recognition the company s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities 
interest income is generally recorded on an accrual basis  unless the collection of such income is not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are recognized as a yield adjustment to the related loans by amortizing them into income over the term of the loan using a method which approximates the interest method 
other credit related fees  such as standby letter of credit fees  loan placement fees and annual credit card fees are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed 
for loans placed on nonaccrual status  the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed at management s discretion based upon management s assessment of collectibility  and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan

net interest income net interest income  the most significant component of earnings  is the difference between the interest and fees received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets consist primarily of loans  and to a lesser extent  investments in securities issued by federal  state and local authorities  and corporations  as well as interest bearing deposits and overnight funds with other financial institutions 
these earning assets are funded by a combination of interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities  primarily customer deposits and short term and long term borrowings

as summarized in table  the increase in net interest income between the two twelve month periods ended december  and is comprised of an increase in total interest income of approximately million  which was only partially offset by an increase in total interest expense of approximately million 
the bank s net interest margin  as shown in table  increased to at december  from at december   an increase of basis points basis points between the two periods 
the net margin of reported during represents an increase of basis points from the net margin realized by the company during while assets have grown over the past three years and the balance sheet mix has changed  interest rate movements over those three years have played a significant role in net interest income trends 
market rates of interest began to rise significantly during the second half of  with the prime rate rising basis points between june  and december   rising another basis points during  and then another basis points during as a result  the prime rate averaged for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
both the company s net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
both are also affected by changes in yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  referred to as rate change 
the following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated

on average  time deposits decreased million  while interest bearing demand and savings accounts increased on average by million and million  respectively  between the years ended december  and december  provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses and the amount added to the allowance for credit losses is determined on the basis of management s continuous credit review of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  current and future economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
such factors consider the allowance for credit losses to be adequate when it covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on the condition of the loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is sufficient to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio 
for the year ended december  the provision to the allowance for credit losses amounted to  as compared to million for both the years ended december  and reductions in the provision to the allowance for credit losses during were the result of lower levels of nonperforming loans during the year 
the amount provided to the allowance for credit losses during brought the allowance to of net outstanding loan balances at december   as compared to of net outstanding loan balances at december   and at december  noninterest income the following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated and the net changes between those years years ended december  increase decrease during year in thousands customer service fees gain on sale of securities gain loss on sale of oreo proceeds from life insurance loss on swap ineffectiveness gain on sale of investment gain loss on sale of fixed assets shared appreciation income other total noninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services that are provided to the company s banking customers and  to a lesser extent  gains on sales of company assets and other miscellaneous income 
noninterest income for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the previous year  and increased million when compared to the year ended december  increases in noninterest income experienced during were the result of several large nonrecurring or unusual items  which were partially offset by modest declines in customer service fees 
customer service fees continue to provide the majority of noninterest income over the three years presented 
customer service fees decreased  between the years ended december and december   which is attributable  in part  to declines in atm fee income  as well as overdraft charges and business analysis fees 
increases in customer service fees realized between and were comprised of increases in atm and overdraft charges  as well as additional fee revenue generated by the two kern county branches acquired during april nonrecurring items included in noninterest income during included a million gain on the sale of an investment during the first quarter of  as well as million gain from the sale of the company s administration building during the third quarter of noninterest income was further enhanced during the second quarter of by  in death benefit proceeds realized from the company s bank owned life insurance 
shared appreciation income has fluctuated over the three years presented  with increases of  between and  as compared to increases of  between and shared appreciation income results from agreements between the company and the borrower on certain construction loans where the company agrees to receive interest on the loan at maturity rather than monthly and the borrower agrees to share in the profits of the project 
the profit is determined by the appraised value of the completed project and subsequent refinancing or sale of the project 
due to the difficulty in calculating future values  shared appreciation income is recognized when received 
the company does not participate in a significant number of shared appreciation projects  and as a result  does not anticipate large amounts of shared appreciation income on an ongoing basis 
gains on sales of investment securities decreased  between and  but increased  between and as the result of securities sold during the fourth quarter of when the company restructured the investment portfolio to reduce the risk profile of the company 
noninterest income increased million between the years ended december  and december  customer service fees continued to provide the majority of noninterest income with a modest increase of  between and  and included increases in atm and overdraft charges  as well as additional fee revenue generated by the two kern county branches acquired during april shared appreciation income increased between and gains on sales of investment securities increased  between and and are the result of securities sold during the fourth quarter of as the company restructured the investment portfolio to reduce the risk profile of the company

these figures represent an increase of million or between the years ended december  and and an increase of million or between the years ended december  and noninterest expense increases between the three years presented are associated primarily with normal  anticipated growth of the company  as well as additional costs incurred during both and increases in oreo expense experienced during were primarily the result of additional expenses  including disposal and clean up costs  incurred on a single oreo property  which is in the process of liquidation 
expenses on oreo increased approximately million between the years ended december  and december  professional fees decreased  between the year ended december  and december  primarily as the result of reductions in legal expenses associated with impaired loans

deposits the bank attracts commercial deposits primarily from local businesses and professionals  as well as retail checking accounts  savings accounts and time deposits 
total deposits increased million or during the year to a balance of million at december  and increased million or between december  and december  core deposits  consisting of all deposits other than time deposits of  or more and brokered deposits  continue to provide the foundation for the bank s principal sources of funding and liquidity

increases in money market accounts and time deposits in excess of  are primarily the result of depositors seeking higher yields over the past year as competitors such as brokerage firms and credit unions have driven up rates to attract deposits 
increases in time deposits of  and over experienced during were largely the result of brokered time deposits obtained by the company as part of its liquidity strategy to fund loan growth during the year 
the company continues to emphasize core deposits as part of its relationship banking strategy 
as a result  core deposits  including now and money market accounts  and savings accounts  as well as noninterest bearing checking accounts  continue to provide the company s primary funding source 
during the years ended december  increases were experienced in all deposit categories  except in time deposits  which continue to decline as the company reduces its dependency on brokered and other out of market time deposits 
the overall level of time deposits declined during and  as the company was able to control the level of these deposits to some degree with pricing strategies 
time deposits  including brokered and other out of market deposits were allowed to run off as they matured as the need for such deposits diminished 
then  as loan growth exceeded deposit growth during  the company sought to increase time deposits  including brokered deposits  to fund that asset growth 
the company has utilized brokered deposits over the past several years to enhance its funding needs  with brokered deposits totaling million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
in addition  the company has been able to obtain time deposits from the state of california  which totaled million at december   and million at both december  and the time deposits of the state of california are collateralized by pledged securities in the company s investment portfolio 
the company will continue to use pricing strategies to control the overall level of time deposits as part of its growth and liquidity planning process 
the company s deposit base consists of two major components represented by noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing deposits consist of time certificates  now and money market accounts and savings deposits 
total interest bearing deposits increased million or between december  and december   and noninterest bearing deposits increased million or between the same two periods presented

short term borrowings the company has the ability to obtain borrowed funds consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank fhlb advances as alternatives to retail deposit funds 
the company has established collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit with several correspondent banks  as well as a securities dealer  for the purpose of obtaining borrowed funds as needed 
the company may continue to borrow funds in the future as part of its asset liability strategy  and may use these funds to acquire certain other assets as deemed appropriate by management for investment purposes and to better utilize the capital resources of the bank 
federal funds purchased represent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured 
repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of us government agencies  and generally have maturities of one to six months  but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate as part of the company s asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances are collateralized by the company s investment in fhlb stock  securities  and certain qualifying mortgage loans 
in addition  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco  which would be collateralized by certain pledged loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the lines of credit are subject to periodic review of the company s financial statements by the grantors of the credit lines 
lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time if the grantors feel there are adverse trends in the company s financial position 
the company had collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit aggregating million and million  as well as fhlb lines of credit totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
these lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the federal funds rate or are indexed to short term us treasury rates or libor

implicit in lending activities is the fact that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time  depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans and commitments to extend credit  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  collateral  and concentrations of credit 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and the state of the local economy 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company follows  in accordance with gaap  the guidelines set forth in the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses statement issued jointly by banking regulators during  and updated and revised in the statement outlines characteristics that should be used in segmentation of the loan portfolio for purposes of the analysis including risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
it also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
was also released at this time which represents the sec staff s view relating to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
it is also generally consistent with the guidance published by the banking regulators 
the company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven segments  primarily by loan class and type  that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under sfas no 
those loans which are determined to be impaired under sfas no 
are not subject to the general reserve analysis under sfas no 
 and evaluated individually for specific impairment 
the eleven segments of the company s loan portfolio are as follows subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to the company s loan classification reported elsewhere in these financial statements loan balance at december  loan segments for loan loss reserve analysis dollars in s commercial and business loans government program loans total commercial and industrial commercial real estate term loans single family residential loans home improvement home equity loans total real estate mortgage total real estate construction loans total agricultural loans consumer loans overdraft protection lines overdrafts total installment other total lease financing total loans the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance  specific allowances for problem graded loans classified loans and the unallocated allowance in addition  the allowance analysis also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and  may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
factors that may affect collectibility of the loan portfolio include levels of  and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  trends in volumes and term of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions and  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  including high balance loan concentrations and participations 
management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans substandard  doubtful  and loss  special mention loans  and pass graded loans  based on a loss migration model 
the migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the past twelve quarters three years and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications  which are pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
certain loans are homogenous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade 
these homogenous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard  doubtful  and loss 
loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the company s portfolio  with an additional participation factor added  if required  for specific risks associated with participations 
in general  participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the company  and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well being of the underlying agent bank 
the formula allowance includes reserves for certain off balance sheet risks including letters of credit  unfunded loan commitments  and lines of credit 
reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on the company s historical loss experience and other loss factors  rather than specific loss contingencies 
during   and  the company classified reserves for off balance sheet commitments totaling   and  respectively  as other liabilities pursuant to current accounting guidance 
prior to  the reserves for these off balance sheet commitments are included in the company s allowance for credit losses  rather than a separate liability on the balance sheet because the reserve amounts are considered to be immaterial in relation to total liabilities 
at december   and the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled   and  respectively 
specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified loans  impaired loans  and other loans in which management believes there is a probability that a loss has been incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
specific allowance amounts include those calculated under sfas no 
under sfas no 
 for impaired loans  specific allowances are determined based on the collateralized value of the underlying properties  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows  or the market value of the underlying assets 
under sfas no 
 for classified loans excluding impaired loans  specific allowances  where required  are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole 
the specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan by loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan  as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar characteristics  based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the result of both expected and unanticipated changes in various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 
the company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio 
by analyzing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available 
in performing the periodic migration analysis  management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
there are a number of other factors  which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors 
they include trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume and terms  effects of changes in lending policies  concentrations of credit  competition  national and local economic trends and conditions  experience of lending staff  loan review and board of directors oversight  high balance loan concentration  and other business conditions 
there were no changes in estimation methods or assumptions during that affected the methodology for assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management and the company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly and monthly basis  and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change 
the company s loan committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the company  and to keep the board of directors informed through committee minutes 
all special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on criticized asset reports  which are reviewed by senior management 
with this information  the migration analysis and the impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  restructured debt  and currently performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected 
management bases the measurement of these impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan s stated interest rates 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision  if applicable 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans  commercial and residential real estate loans  construction loans  and agricultural loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include problem loans other than delinquent loans 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million and million  respectively 
included in total impaired loans at december   are million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
total impaired loans at december  included million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
in the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms  income is recognized under the accrual method 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized income of  and  respectively  on such loans 
for the year ended december   the company recognized no income on such loans 
the company focuses on competition and other economic conditions within its market area  which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the portfolio 
the company continues to experience increased competition from major banks  local independents and non bank institutions creating pressure on loan pricing 
with interest rates rising significantly since july  the federal reserve perceived economic growth as strong  but with rates remaining level during the second half of  indications are that rates may begin to decline sometime during the later part of both business and consumer spending have improved during the past several years  with gdp currently ranging between and 
it is difficult to determine how long the federal reserve will continue to adjust interest rates in an effort to influence the economy  however with the basis point increase in the prime rate during the second half of  an additional basis point increase during  and then four basis point increases during  it is predicted that we are near the end of an interest rate cycle 
it is likely that the business environment in california will continue to be influenced by these domestic as well as global events 
the local market has improved economically during the past several years while the rest of the state and the nation has experienced slowed economic growth 
the local area residential housing markets continue to perform  which should bode well for sustained growth in the company s market areas of fresno and madera  and kern counties  although there is some indication of slowing commercial and residential real estate markets in the area 
local unemployment rates remain high primarily as a result of the areas agricultural dynamics  however unemployment rates have improved during the past several years 
it is difficult to predict what impact this will have on the local economy 
the company believes that the central san joaquin valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and housing costs remain reasonable relative to other areas of the state  although this growth may begin to slow as higher interest rates dampen economic expansion 
management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the company s exposure from local and worldwide economic conditions  as well as potentially volatile real estate markets  and takes these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the following table provides a summary of the company s allowance for credit losses  provisions made to that allowance  and charge off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the years indicated 
december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of period before deducting allowances for credit losses average net loans outstanding during period balance of allowance at beginning of period loans charged off real estate commercial and industrial lease financing installment and other total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate commercial and industrial lease financing installment and other total loan recoveries net loans charged off reclassification of off balance sheet reserve reserve acquired in business acquisition provision charged to operating expense balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period net loan charge offs to total average loans net loan charge offs to loans at end of period allowance for credit losses to total loans at end of period net loan charge offs to allowance for credit losses net loan charge offs to provision for credit losses management believes that the credit loss allowance to total loans at december  is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that the economic conditions which may adversely affect the company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
although the company does not normally allocate the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories  an allocation to the major categories has been made for the purposes of this report as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based on the same factors as considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction agricultural installment other lease financing not allocated during  reserve allocations increased for commercial and industrial loans  leasing financing  real estate mortgage loans  and installment loans 
as with prior years  the increase in reserve allocation for lease financing loans is the result of additional reserves allocated to a nonperforming lease portfolio see discussion following 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans are the result of increased loan volume  while increases in reserve allocations for real estate mortgage and installment loans are primarily the result of increases in substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations decreased for real estate construction loans as a result of significant decreases in the level of substandard loans in that category between december  and december reserve allocations increased during for both leasing financing and agricultural loans 
the increase in reserve allocation for lease financing loans is the result of additional reserves allocated to a nonperforming lease portfolio see discussion following  while increases in reserve allocations for agricultural loans are the result of increases in substandard loans in that category 
reserve allocations decreased for commercial and industrial loans as a result of significant decreases in the level of substandard commercial and industrial loans between december  and december the increase in reserve allocations for lease financing loans since is the result of the nonperformance of a purchased lease portfolio 
the company purchased a schedule of payments collateralized by surety bonds and lease payments in september that have a current balance owing of million plus interest 
the leases have been nonperforming since june of the impaired lease portfolio is on non accrual status and has a specific allowance allocation of million and million allocated at december  and  respectively  and a net carrying value of million at december  the specific allowance was determined based on an estimate of expected future cash flows 
the company filed suit for recovery in september and shortly after  the surety guarantor of the leases entered into court proceedings to discharge their guarantee based on the fact that many of the underlying leases were fraudulent 
the company  based upon advice from its counsel  does not believe it is probable the guarantors fraud defense will prevail and intends to vigorously pursue the guarantee 
late in the third quarter of the federal judge in the proceeding issued an order on the company s motion for judgment on the pleadings 
under standard court procedural restraints for such motions  not all evidence can be considered 
the conclusion of the order noted that the company would prevail if certain evidence  not considered in the motion  can be introduced in a subsequent motion 
the company will submit documentation and evidence with the next motion that its legal counsel believes sufficient to prevail 
the judge ordered mediation and stayed further motions until mediation is completed 
on january  the company attended mediation 
although some progress was made  resolution of this matter was not concluded 
the company has filed a request with the court to submit a further motion and is awaiting a response from the court 
the guarantor is in a run off program supervised by the illinois department of insurance 
run off programs allow companies to manage an orderly liquidation of assets and settlement of liabilities 
a concern of the company with the matters now before the court is the timing of the judicial process 
at some point the department of insurance may take over management of the surety and the company believes this would complicate and delay further the collection of amounts awarded by the court 
the company believes that under generally accepted accounting principles  a total loss of principal is not probable at this time and the specific allowance of million calculated for the impaired lease portfolio at december  under sfas no 
is in accordance with gaap 
during a regulatory examination in the fourth quarter of  the lease portfolio in question was classified as doubtful by the bank s regulators based upon state regulatory guidelines 
california state statute no 
requires that a credit  where interest is past due and unpaid for more than one year and is not well secured and not in the process of collection  be charged off 
the regulators requested that the bank charge off the principal balance in the first or second quarter of for regulatory purposes if the judge had not made a ruling on the case by march  or  if a ruling had been made but no principal payments have been received by june  the court did not rule by march   and has not made a final ruling on the case at the time of this k filing 
as a result  effective march   the company charged off the entire million principal balance for regulatory purposes 
as a result of the regulatory charge off  the company carries a difference between its regulatory accounting principles rap books and its generally accepted accounting principles gaap books 
the financial entries made for regulatory reporting purposes resulted in a million reduction in loan balances with a corresponding reduction in the reserve for credit losses 
additional provisions for credit losses of million were also required for regulatory accounting purposes  which resulted in a reduction of million in regulatory net income net tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as compared to the financial statements presented under gaap in the company s annual report on form k 
during  the company revised its methodology for allocating the total allowance for credit losses between the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
prior to  the entire loan portfolio was reviewed under the guidelines set by sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
in addition  those loans considered to be impaired were also reviewed under standards required by sfas no 
 and specific reserves were calculated under those guidelines 
for purposes of allocating the formula allowance and the specific allowance  loans identified as impaired under sfas no 
were allocated a formula reserve as calculated under sfas no 
 and an additional specific allowance if required under sfas no 
as a result  a portion of the allowance for impaired loans might be included in the formula allowance as calculated under sfas no 
 and the remainder would be designated a specific allowance  so that the entire allowance for impaired loans would be adequate under sfas no 
effective june  the company segregated those loans considered impaired under sfas no 
from the loan portfolio and analyzed the remainder of the loan portfolio under sfas no 
then loans considered impaired under sfas no 
were reviewed separately for specific allowance allocation 
as a result  all allowance reserves allocated to impaired loans are now considered specific reserves for purposes of the company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  rather than a combination of formula allowance and specific allowance 
the following summarizes the company s allowance for credit losses related to the specific  formula  and unallocated reserves for the year ends shown amounts shown prior to have been adjusted to reflect the revised methodology for allocating the total allowance between the formula allowance and the specific allowance as discussed above december  dollars in s formula allowance specific allowance unallocated allowance total allowance the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december   and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to lease financing loans  and the remaining     and  were allocated to commercial real estate  agricultural  installment  commercial and industrial loans  and real estate construction loans  respectively 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to lease financing loans  and the remaining   and  were allocated to real estate construction loans  agricultural loans  and commercial and industrial loans  respectively 
at december   the company s allowance for credit losses was million  consisting of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to commercial and industrial loans  and the remaining million   and  were allocated to lease financing loans  construction loans  and real estate mortgage loans  respectively 
the total formula allowance increased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of increased volume in pass loans 
there were only minor formula allowance allocation changes between loan categories occurring between december  and december   although the formula allowance for commercial and industrial loans increased nearly  during between december  and december   substandard loans decreased million  while special mention and doubtful loans increased million and million  respectively 
the total formula allowance increased approximately  between and  with only minor formula allowance allocation changes between loan categories occurring between december  and december  although pass loans increased approximately million between december  and december   the overall formula allocation percentage dropped slightly as the result of adjustments to historical loss factors 
between december  and december   substandard loans and special mention loans decreased million and million  respectively 
although in some instances  the downgrading of a loan resulting from the factors used by the company in its allowance analysis has been reflected in the formula allowance  management believes that in some instances  the impact of material events and trends has not yet been reflected in the level of nonperforming loans or the internal risk grading process regarding these loans 
accordingly  the company s evaluation of probable losses related to these factors may be reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent losses concerning these factors involve a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits  and therefore the company does not spread the unallocated allowance among segments of the portfolio 
at december  the company had an unallocated allowance of  reflecting a decrease from the balance of  at december   and an increase from the balance of  at december  management s estimates of the unallocated allowance are based upon a number of underlying factors including the effect of deteriorating national and local economic trends  the effects of export market conditions on certain agricultural and manufacturing borrowers  the effects of abnormal weather patterns on agricultural borrowers  as well as other borrowers that may be impacted by such conditions  the effect of increased competition in the company s market area and the resultant potential impact of more relaxed underwriting standards to borrowers with multi bank relationships  the effect of soft real estate markets  and the effects of having a larger number of borrowing relationships which are close to the company s lending limit  any one if which were not to perform to contractual terms  would have a material impact on the allowance 
the company s loan portfolio has concentrations in commercial real estate  commercial  and construction loans  however these portfolio percentages fall within the company s loan policy guidelines 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on loans for which reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectibility of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
such loans are placed on nonaccrual status whenever the payment of principal or interest is days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant  and interest collected is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
management may grant exceptions to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands  except footnote nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans  past due days or more  still accruing nonperforming loans to total gross loans nonperforming assets to total gross loans there are no nonaccrual loans at december  and  which are restructured 
included in nonaccrual loans at december  are restructured loans totaling  the interest income that would have been earned on nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  in accordance with their original terms is approximately  the overall level of nonperforming assets declined between december  and december  primarily as the result of declines in other real estate owned 
the decline in other real estate owned experienced during is the result of the partial sale of an oreo property during the third quarter of the company incurred approximately million in disposal and cleanup costs related to this property during nonaccrual loans declined between december  and december  as the result of a transfer of a single lending relationship from nonaccrual status to accrual status during the first quarter of the million loan  which was restructured during the first quarter of has been reclassified as such for reporting purposes 
the overall level of nonperforming assets remained level between december  and december totaling approximately million at both period ends 
while nonaccrual loans decreased million between the two periods  other real estate owned oreo increased million 
nonaccrual loans declined between the two periods as the result of nonperforming loans which were either sold  paid off  or charged off to the allowance for loan losses 
a substantial portion of the nonaccrual loans at december  were collateralized by real estate 
although two significant oreo properties were sold during  million of a million loan relationship which became nonperforming during  was ultimately transferred to oreo during the third quarter of and included in the million balance at december  the remaining million of the nonperforming loan consisted of equipment and inventory  and was transferred to assets held for sale included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the overall level of nonperforming assets has remained high since  primarily as the result of a small number of large lending relationships  which have become nonperforming during that period 
during  three large relationships totaling approximately million were classified as nonaccrual  while approximately million in nonaccrual loans were transferred to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
during  million  representing one of the three large relationships that had become nonaccrual during the previous year  was foreclosed upon and transferred to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
in addition during  a nonperforming lease portfolio totaling million was taken to nonaccrual status 
nonperforming assets begun to decline during  remained stable through  then again declined during as management increased efforts to resolve nonperforming assets 
continued high levels of nonperforming assets have the potential to impact the future earnings growth of the company  however management believes that with stable nonperforming balances combined with prudent lending policies and adequate loan loss reserves  the company will not experience any significant impact on earnings 
loans past due more than days are receiving increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk 
the company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in its ongoing effort to recognize loan problems at an earlier point in time when they may be dealt with more effectively 
as impaired loans  nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly 
during february  the company determined that certain recent events had resulted in the deterioration of a land development loan with an outstanding principal balance of approximately million and accrued interest totaling  at march  the loan is a shared appreciation credit  and as such  the company has agreed to receive interest on the loan as lots are sold rather than monthly  and the borrower has agreed to share in the profits of the project 
interest is accrued and recognized in income on an ongoing basis 
shared appreciation profit is currently established at  per lot 
the amount can be changed by agreement of both parties 
due to the difficulty in calculating future values  shared appreciation income is recognized when received 
during october  the company approved the conversion of the existing loan made during january to an increased revolving line of credit to facilitate the completion of improvements on a lot subdivision for which a final site map was in the process of approval  and to also provide for the building of single family residences 
the existing loan was due to mature during february funding for the project was to be provided in controlled stages based upon appropriate collateral values being created 
the terms of the agreement  which included requirements for the modification and increases to the borrower  were minimum standards in the industry 
those requirements were presented to the borrower during october the required information necessary to document and establish per lot per unit cost controls was developed between the company and the borrower during december and january during late january  proposed revolving line of credit agreement was sent to the borrower for approval 
shortly thereafter  the borrower responded with a number of comments and requested changes to the agreement 
during early february  the company reviewed the comments and requested changes to the agreement  acknowledging to the borrower that the company would agree to certain changes  but would not comply with a number of the requested changes 
during mid february  the company received notice that the borrower had filed a lawsuit for breach of contract  and declaratory relief and accounting 
the company  through counsel  responded with notification to the borrower that the proposed revolving line of credit agreement was being terminated  and that the company demanded payment in full on the matured loan by march  the company did not receive payment in full on that date  and filed a notice of default on march  the existing matured loan totaling million in principal and  in accrued interest was moved to nonaccrual status during the second week of march based upon the current appraised value of the property and the additional values estimated of the completed lots  the company has not reversed the accrued interest amount of  from income 
at this time  the company believes that based upon such values  it will collect all principal and interest due on the loan 
except for the loans included in the above table  and the land development loan discussed above  there were no loans at december  where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual  past due or restructured loan at some future date 
liquidity and asset liability management the primary function of asset liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on and off balance sheet financial obligations  including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals  without straining the company s equity structure 
to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company relies on  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  cash inflows from deposits and short term borrowings  repayments of principal on loans and investments  and interest income received 
the company s principal cash outflows are for loan origination  purchases of investment securities  depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses 
other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at december  include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks  the federal home loan bank  and from the federal reserve bank totaling million 
the company has maintained significant positive cash flows from operations over the past three years  which amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements  which comply with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
in addition to lines of credit from other banks totaling million  the contingency plan includes steps that may be taken in the event the total liquidity ratio falls or is projected to fall below for any extended period of time 
the bank alco committee shall take steps to correct this condition using one or more of the following methods as needed investments near maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits 
unsecured fed funds lines with correspondents may be used to fund short term peaks in loan demand or deposit run off 
other off balance sheet funding sources such as credit lines at fhlb or the frb may be used for longer periods 
the bank will not rely on brokered money as a primary source of funds 
however  if may be prudent to utilize brokered deposits particularly at times when the interest costs are lower than could be obtained in the local market 
however  the sum of all brokered deposits will not exceed of the total deposits of the bank 
the bank may elect to operate a telemarketing money desk for the purpose of acquiring certificates of deposits from both the local market and national market 
the board of directors and management recognize that deposits acquired through money desk operations may be considered a higher cost and more volatile type of deposit than traditional bank deposits 
selling whole loans or participation in loans or by increasing the amounts sold in existing participation loans are additional means for increasing liquidity 
the state of california treasurer is a reliable source of deposits 
the bank can typically accept cd s from this source up to of equity as long as it has sufficient collateral pledged 
marketing for cd s within our marketplace is another means for raising funds or through programs that post our rates on their website  deposits from these sources should not exceed of the banks total deposits for extended periods beyond days without board approval 
should the bank become illiquid in spite of these steps  it will curtail its lending activities 
the first step in this process will be to curtail credit marketing and tighten pricing guidelines 
the second step will be to encourage loan payoffs on a selective basis where circumstances and loan documentation provide this opportunity 
only as a last resort will the bank totally curtail lending activities to credit worthy customers 
the company continues to utilize liability management  when needed  as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings  the company has been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while  at the same time  better utilizing its capital resources  and better controlling interest rate risk 
the borrowings are generally short term and more closely match the repricing characteristics of floating rate loans  which comprise approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december  this does not preclude the company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but  with favorable borrowing rates  the company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabilities fund 
if  at some time  rate spreads become unfavorable  the company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and  either control asset growth or  fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities 
the company s liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos and investment securities  is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur 
within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets 
this is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans  which historically have represented the company s highest yielding asset 
at december   the bank had of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of 
liquid assets at december  include cash and cash equivalents totaling million as compared to million at december  liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non core deposits as well as short term borrowings 
core deposits  which comprise approximately of total deposits at december   provide a significant and stable funding source for the company 
at december   unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank totaling million are collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the carrying value of loans pledged on these unused borrowing lines totaled million at december  for further discussion of the company s borrowing lines  see short term borrowings included in previously in the financial condition section of this financial review 
the liquidity of the parent company  united security bancshares  is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  united security bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
during and  total dividends paid by the bank to the parent company totaled million and million  respectively

regulatory matters capital adequacy capital adequacy for bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks has become increasingly important in recent years 
continued deregulation of the banking industry since the s has resulted in  among other things  a broadening of business activities allowed beyond that of traditional banking products and services 
because of this volatility within the banking and financial services industry  regulatory agencies have increased their focus upon ensuring that banking institutions meet certain capital requirements as a means of protecting depositors and investors against such volatility 
during july  the company completed an offering of trust preferred securities in an aggregate amount of million to enhance its regulatory base  while providing additional liquidity 
subsequent to the completion of the offering  the company contributed million of that offering to the bank to enhance its capital position 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital up to a maximum of of tier capital 
any additional portion will qualify as tier capital 
as shareholders equity increases  the amount of tier capital that can be comprised of trust preferred securities will increase 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system board of governors has adopted regulations requiring insured institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus intangible assets  identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries  plus unrealized losses or minus unrealized gains on available for sale securities to total assets 
institutions which have received the highest composite regulatory rating and which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to total assets 
to be considered well capitalized  the institution must maintain a leverage capital ratio of 
all other institutions are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum requirements 
the board of governors has also adopted a statement of policy  supplementing its leverage capital ratio requirements  which provides definitions of qualifying total capital consisting of tier capital and tier supplementary capital  including the allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and sets forth minimum risk based capital ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
the most highly rated insured institutions are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
to be considered well capitalized  institutions must maintain a ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
the following table sets forth the company s and the bank s actual capital positions at december  and the regulatory minimums for the company and the bank to be well capitalized under the guidelines discussed above company bank regulatory minimums well capitalized actual capital ratios actual capital ratios total risk based capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio under federal reserve guidelines  the company and the bank are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  tier capital to risk weighted assets of  and a leverage ratio of  to be considered well capitalized 
as is indicated by the above table  the company and the bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital guidelines at december  management believes that  under the current regulations  both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
dividends dividends paid to shareholders by the company are subject to restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law 
the california general corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal the amount of the proposed distribution 
the primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders will come from cash dividends received by the company from the bank 
during the year ended december   the company received million in cash dividends from the bank  from which the company declared million in dividends to shareholders 
the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in california state banking law  and administered by the california commissioner of financial institutions commissioner 
under such restrictions  the bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the bank or the bank s net income for the last three fiscal years less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time 
if the above test is not met  cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the commissioner  in an amount not exceeding the bank s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year 
such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends  which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the commissioner 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the commissioner finds that the shareholders equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound  the commissioner may order the state bank not to pay any dividend 
the frb may also limit dividends paid by the bank 
this is not the case with the bank 
year to date dividends of million and million paid to shareholders and the company  respectively  through december  were well within the maximum allowed under those regulatory guidelines  and did not require prior approval of the commissioner

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and market risk an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or is subject to interest rate adjustments as market rates of interest change 
interest rate sensitivity is the measure of the volatility of earnings from movements in market rates of interest  which is generally reflected in interest rate spread 
as interest rates change in the market place  yields earned on assets do not necessarily move in tandem with interest rates paid on liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is related to liquidity in that each is affected by maturing assets and sources of funds 
interest rate sensitivity is also affected by assets and liabilities with interest rates that are subject to change prior to maturity 
the object of interest rate sensitivity management is to minimize the impact on earnings from interest rate changes in the marketplace 
in recent years  deregulation  causing liabilities to become more interest rate sensitive  combined with interest rate volatility in the capital markets  has placed additional emphasis on this principal 
when management decides to maintain repricing imbalances  it usually does so on the basis of a well conceived strategy designed to ensure that the risk is not excessive and that liquidity is properly maintained 
the company s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability management committee alco  which reports to the board of directors on a periodic basis  pursuant to established operating policies and procedures 
as part of its overall risk management  the company pursues various asset and liability management strategies  which may include obtaining derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest fluctuations on the company s net interest margin 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the purpose of minimizing interest rate fluctuations on its interest rate margin and equity 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the prime rate prime 
the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and is designated as a hedge of the variability of cash flows the company receives from certain variable rate loans indexed to prime 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the swap agreement is measured at fair value and reported as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swap that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest income when such cash flow occurs in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedge is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income as part of noninterest income 
the amortizing hedge has a remaining notional value of million and duration of approximately months 
as of december   the maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows is approximately years 
as of december   the loss amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with these cash flows totaled  net of tax benefit of 
during the year ended december    was reclassified from other accumulated comprehensive income as a reduction to interest income 
the company has performed a quarterly analysis of the effectiveness of the interest rate swap agreement at december  as a result of a correlation analysis  the company has determined that the swap remains highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge and  therefore  continues to qualify for hedge accounting under the guidelines of sfas no 
however  during the second quarter of  the company determined that the underlying loans being hedged were paying off faster than the notional value of the hedge instrument was amortizing 
as a result  the notional value of the hedge instrument was approximately million greater than the underlying loans being hedged at june   million greater than the underlying loans being hedged at september   and million greater than the underlying loans being hedged at december  
this difference between the notional value of the hedge and the underlying hedged assets is considered an overhedge pursuant to sfas no 
guidelines and may constitute ineffectiveness if the difference is other than temporary 
at june   the company determined that the difference was other than temporary and  as a result  reclassified  of the pretax hedge loss reported in other comprehensive income into earnings 
during the third quarter of  the company adjusted the pretax loss reported in other comprehensive income by  resulting in a year to date loss related to swap ineffectiveness of  reported in earnings at september  then  as a result of the fourth quarter analysis for ineffectiveness  the company adjusted the pretax loss reported in other comprehensive income by  resulting in a net year to date loss related to swap ineffectiveness of  reported in earnings at december  the ineffective amount reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings was based upon the difference between the net present value of the anticipated cash flows using the notional value of the hedge  and the net present value of anticipated cash flows using the remaining balances of the underlying loans being hedged 
the  in expense recognized as hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in noninterest income as of december  interest rate risk can be measured through various methods including gap  duration and market value analysis as well as income simulation models  which provides a dynamic view of interest rate sensitivity based on the assumptions of the company s management 
the company employs each of these methods and refines these processes to make the most accurate measurements possible 
the information provided by these calculations is the basis for management decisions in managing interest rate risk 
from the gap report below  the company is apparently subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its assets have the potential to reprice more quickly than its liabilities within the next year 
at december   the company had a cumulative month gap of million or of total earning assets 
management believes the gap analysis shown below is not entirely indicative of the company s actual interest rate sensitivity  because certain interest sensitive liabilities would not reprice to the same degree as interest sensitive assets 
for example  if the prime rate were to change by basis points  the floating rate loans included in the million immediately adjustable category would change by the full basis points 
interest bearing checking and savings accounts which are also included in the immediately adjustable column probably would move only a portion of the basis point rate change and  in fact  might not even move at all 
the effects of market value risk have been mitigated to some degree by the makeup of the bank s balance sheet 
loans are generally short term or are floating rate instruments 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio matures or reprices within one year  and only of the portfolio matures or reprices in more than years 
total investment securities including call options and prepayment assumptions  have a combined duration of approximately years 
nearly million or of interest bearing liabilities mature or can be repriced within the next months  even though the rate elasticity of deposits with no defined maturities may not necessarily be the same as interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the company s gap  or estimated interest rate sensitivity profile based on ending balances as of december   representing the interval of time before earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond to changes in market rates of interest 
assets and liabilities are categorized by remaining interest rate maturities rather than by principal maturities of obligations

see above for discussion of the impact of floating rate cd s 
the company utilizes a vendor purchased simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on a   and basis point rise and a   and basis point fall in interest rates ramped over a twelve month period  with net interest impacts projected out as far as twenty four months 
in addition  a most likely scenario is projected based upon expected rate changes over the month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment of certain assets and liabilities 
projected net interest income is calculated assuming customers will reinvest maturing deposit accounts and the company will originate new loans 
the balance sheet growth assumptions utilized correspond closely to the company s strategic growth plans and annual budget 
excess cash is invested in overnight funds or other short term investments such as us treasuries 
cash shortfalls are covered through additional borrowing of overnight or short term funds 
the board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in net interest income of and in the event of a bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve month period 
based on the information and assumptions utilized in the simulation model at december   the resultant projected impact on net interest income falls within policy limits set by the board of directors for all rate scenarios simulated 
the company also utilizes the same vendor purchased simulation model to project the impact of changes in interest rates on the underlying market value of all the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet accounts under alternative interest rate scenarios 
the resultant net value  as impacted under each projected interest rate scenario  is referred to as the market value of equity mv of equity 
this technique captures the interest rate risk of the company s business mix across all maturities 
the market analysis is performed using an immediate rate shock of   and basis points up and down calculating the present value of expected cash flows under each rate environment at applicable discount rates 
the market value of loans is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows over either the term to maturity for fixed rate loans or scheduled repricing for floating rate loans using the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the market value of investment securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from reliable independent brokers 
the market value of time deposits is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows using current rates for similar instruments of comparable maturities 
the market value of deposits with no defined maturities  including interest bearing checking  money market and savings accounts is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows at a rate equal to the difference between the cost of these deposits and the alternate use of the funds  federal funds in this case 
assumed maturities for these deposits are estimated using decay analysis and are generally assumed to have implied maturities of less than five years 
for noninterest sensitive assets and liabilities  the market value is equal to their carrying value amounts at the reporting date 
the company s interest rate risk policy establishes maximum decreases in the company s market value of equity of and in the event of an immediate and sustained bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates 
as shown in the table below  the percentage changes in the net market value of the company s equity are within policy limits for both rising and falling rate scenarios 
the following sets forth the analysis of the company s market value risk inherent in its interest sensitive financial instruments as they relate to the entire balance sheet at december  and december  in thousands 
fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with absolute precision 
assumptions have been made as to the appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows and other variables 
changes in these assumptions significantly affect the estimates and as such  the obtained fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in the actual sale or liquidation of such financial instruments  nor comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate future business
