item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those contained in the discussion on forward looking statements and those contained in risk factors contained in item a of this report 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
overview we report our results of operations in two segments early stage and late stage clinical development 
our early stage segment consists primarily of our phase i clinical trial services and our bioanalytical laboratories 
our late stage segment consists primarily of phase ii through phase iv services including consulting services 
prior to  we grew significantly through organic growth and acquisitions 
in and  we did not complete any acquisitions 
during  under the direction of a new management team  we discontinued operations at our miami and ft 
myers facilities and focused our efforts on addressing issues that impacted us during as described throughout this report 
due to our decision to discontinue operations in florida  all financial results in this report reflect our continuing operations only  unless otherwise stated 
certain prior period amounts have been revised as a result of discontinued operations 
our net revenue consists primarily of fees earned for services performed under contracts with branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug company clients 
typically  a portion of our contract fee is due upon signing of the contract  and the majority of the contract fee is generally paid in installments upon the achievement of certain agreed upon performance milestones 
because pharmanet s contracts are generally larger and longer in duration  it typically receives larger advance payments relative to our early stage contracts 
our contracts are generally terminable immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts usually require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  fees earned to date  and in some cases a termination fee 
prior to the acquisition of pharmanet  since most of our contracts were early stage trials which are of short duration  we did not experience any significant terminations of contracts in progress 
pharmanet  whose trials are primarily late stage  typically performs services under long term contracts which are subject to a greater risk of delay or cancellation 
in our long term late stage contracts we have historically reported net revenue  which amount includes any reimbursed out of pocket expenses consisting of travel and other expenses 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  beginning in we began reporting revenue line items consisting of direct revenue and reimbursed out of pockets  together with an expense line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses which will consist of travel and other expenses for which we are reimbursed by our clients 
as described separately above  in we began recording our recurring operating expenses in three primary categories direct costs  selling  general and administrative expenses and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs consist primarily of participant fees and associated expenses  direct labor and employee benefits  facility costs  depreciation associated with facilities and equipment used in conducting trials  and other costs and materials directly related to contracts 
direct costs as a percentage of net revenue vary from period to period  due to the varying mix of contracts and services performed and to the percentage of revenue arising from our canadian operations  which generally have higher direct costs 
selling  general and administrative costs consist primarily of administrative payroll  except for pharmanet  and overhead  advertising and public relations expense  legal and accounting expense  travel  depreciation and amortization related to amortizable intangibles 
pharmanet includes all payroll related costs as part of direct costs  and all office costs and depreciation as part of selling  general and administrative costs 
the gross profit margins on our contracts vary depending upon the nature of the services we perform for our clients 
gross profit margins for our early stage clinical development trials and bioanalytical services generally tend to be higher than those for our late stage trials  management and other services that we perform 
within our early stage business  our gross profit margins are generally higher for trials which involve a larger number of participants  
table of contents a longer period of study time and or the performance of more tests 
gross profit margins for our services to branded drug clients generally tend to be higher than those for generic drug clients 
in addition  our gross profit margins will vary based upon our mix of domestic and international business 
gross profit margins are calculated by dividing the gross profit excluding reimbursed out of pocket expenses by direct revenue 
excluding the tax impact of discontinued operations which is presented separately  our effective tax rate was a benefit of in  compared to a tax expense of in and in in our tax rate dropped significantly due to a us loss from continuing operations for which benefits are recognized to the extent carryback claims are available  a favorable income tax rate change in canada and a greater proportion of earnings generated from outside of the united states in jurisdictions with tax rates below that of the united states than in previous years 
these foreign earnings came primarily from our early stage business in canada and our late stage business in europe 
our future effective tax rate will be dependent on the amount of the tax credits we receive in connection with our canadian operations  our income overseas where our late stage business operates  statutory tax rates in those overseas jurisdictions and the relative contribution of our domestic and foreign operations to our consolidated pre tax income 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of an element of judgment 
actual results inevitably will likely differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and our actual results are subject to the risk factors contained at the end of this section 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue and cost recognition 
the majority of our revenues are recorded from contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare effort expended through that date to estimated total effort to complete the contract 
historically  a majority of our direct revenue have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to years  but can extend in duration up to seven years or longer 
service contracts generally take the form of fee for service or fixed price arrangements 
in the case of fee for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  based upon  for example  hours worked or samples tested 
for long term fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  with performance generally assessed using output measures  such as units of work performed to date as compared to the total units of work contracted 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms 
renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured 
estimates of costs to complete are made to provide  where appropriate  for losses expected on contracts 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
in some cases  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed or products are delivered  as discussed above 
additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance based milestones over the contract duration 
most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice 
these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down the study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to us of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by us under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured 
direct costs include all direct costs related to contract performance and  in the case of pharmanet  all payroll related costs 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as they are incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is possible that the estimates used will change in the near term and that the change could be material 
the uncertainties which can affect 
table of contents our estimates include changes in scope of contracts and unforeseen costs which cannot be billed to the client such as increased costs associated with recruiting special populations for studies 
in the past  our estimates of these uncertainties have not materially affected our revenue or cost recognition  and we do not anticipate making material changes to our method of estimating costs in the future 
as described in the overview above  included in revenue and direct costs are pass through costs for which we are reimbursed by our clients in accordance with eitf we provide a separate line item for reimbursed out of pockets under revenue and a separate line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses under direct costs 
included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts  which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of our clients  analysis of delinquent accounts  the payment histories of the accounts and management s judgment with respect to current economic conditions 
management believes the allowances are sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management reviews our accounts receivable aging on a regular basis for past due accounts 
any uncollectible amounts are written off against the allowance 
management maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historic collectibility and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major client default on its obligations to us  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
as a result of discontinued operations  in we have recorded adjustments directly related to discontinued operations of approximately million as a result of non payment of accounts receivable 
for continuing operations we have historically not made any material adjustments as a result of the non payment of accounts receivable 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of our valuation allowance  if necessary 
we now maintain offices in countries 
we are subject to audit in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
due to the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
our balance sheet reflects certain valuation allowances related to certain us operating losses  our ability to realize foreign tax loss carryforwards as of december  and research tax credits carried forwards and earned in the current year in canada as of december  if the estimates utilized in connection with establishing the valuation allowance prove inaccurate  resulting increases or decreases in the valuation allowance could be required in the future 
any future changes in valuation allowance can have a material impact on our net earnings 
based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we have determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million was required for specific foreign entities 
we have been  and in the future we may be  a party to foreign tax proceedings 
we have established an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for potential adverse outcomes in future tax proceedings which would have an impact on the amount of goodwill reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  any future foreign tax proceedings would have an impact on our results of operations if our estimates prove to be inadequate 
it is possible that changes in our estimates in the future could cause us to either materially increase or decrease the amount of our income tax reserve 
with regard to earnings from foreign operations  our policy is to generally retain such earnings in the country in which they were generated 
this permits us to reduce the material united states income tax liabilities which would generally arise upon repatriation of these earnings 
in order to provide certain flexibility  we have structured our canadian operations to permit us to repay significant sums without united states income tax liability 
in  we repatriated funds of approximately million from canada on a tax free basis leaving us with million that can be repatriated without tax 

table of contents goodwill 
on an annual basis  management assesses the composition of our assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
we will recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognized an impairment charge of million in relating to our operations at cps due to the loss of miami operations which generated significant revenues for cps 
impairment of assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
to date  we have not recognized an impairment charge of this nature 
in the future  we will recognize an impairment if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
share based compensation 
we have granted stock options to our employees at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounted for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the statement of operations 
because we recognized that apb was in the process of being rescinded  in we amended our stock option plan to provide for the granting of restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation in addition to stock options 
in december  apb was superseded by financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payment or statement  which will be effective for all annual accounting periods beginning after july  we adopted statement r effective as of january   and will be required to recognize an expense for the fair value of our outstanding stock options 
under statement r  we must determine the transition method to be used at the date of adoption  the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments and the amortization method for compensation cost 
we adopted the prospective method 
the prospective option requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of statement r 
the transition method requires management to make accounting estimates 
all references in this report to shares of common stock  options outstanding and per share information have been adjusted to give effect to our may three for two stock split effected as a stock dividend 
other estimates 
we make a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to volume rebates  litigation  etc 
historically  changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of direct revenue for and in thousands  except per share data direct revenue direct costs selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill total other income expense earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings from continuing operations before minority interest in joint venture minority interest in joint venture net earnings from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net earnings loss earnings per share from continuing operations basic diluted direct revenue our direct revenue  which does not include reimbursed out of pocket expenses  was approximately million for the year ended december   which is an increase of approximately from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to a increase in revenue in our late stage business partially offset by a decrease of approximately in our early stage business 
our direct revenue for our early stage operations were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this decline of is primarily attributable to a decline in revenues at our early stage canadian operations partially offset by an increase in revenue at our us and european bionanalytical laboratories 
in  we began experiencing severe price competition at our canadian subsidiary which comprises approximately of our early stage segment revenues 
during the second half of this price pressure mitigated slightly 
the reduction in price pressure along with internal process improvement resulted in improved performance in our canadian operations in the second half of our direct revenue in our late stage business increased approximately primarily as a result of performing more clinical trials 
for the twelve month period ended december   direct revenue from us operations was approximately million and million from foreign operations compared to million from our us operations and million from foreign operations for the same period in the increase in direct revenue for both us and foreign operations for compared to the same period in is primarily due to a significant increase in revenues in our late stage business offset to a lesser extent by a decrease in our early stage business 
direct costs for the twelve months ended december   direct costs as a percentage of revenue increased to from for the same period in the increase in direct costs as a percentage of direct revenue is primarily related to our early stage operations 
during we experienced a shift in our business at our canadian operations to more clinical work compared to bioanalytical work as a percentage of their overall business 
we expect this trend 
table of contents to continue for the immediate future 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue are higher in our clinical operations than in the bioanalytical operations 
during  anapharm incurred approximately million of expense to cover direct costs of repeating work on one of its assay methods 
additionally  direct costs which is comprised primarily of labor costs for the early stage segment were significantly higher than expected due to lower than expected revenues 
during  our early stage business experienced more pricing pressure in both the clinical and bioanalytical operations as a result of industry competition in the generic market 
both of these factors increased our early stage business s direct costs as a percentage of revenue 
our early stage business historically has experienced periods of competition 
however  in the second half of  we determined that the pricing pressures in the generic business would become permanent for the foreseeable future and that a change was required in our business model 
as a result of this determination in september  we began implementing steps to reduce both direct and other costs in the early stage segment 
these steps included headcount reductions  reduction of personnel through attrition  process changes to improve efficiencies  reduced reliance on outside contractors and other cost reductions 
we expect these steps to yield between million to million from additional revenue and cost reductions during the next months 
these reductions contributed to improved operating results in the early stage segment during the three month period ended december  we cannot assure you that the full benefit of these reductions will be realized during on a going forward basis we expect that direct cost as a percentage of direct revenue will vary due to the mix of contracts within our early stage and late stage business 
gross profit margins our gross profit margins as a percentage of direct revenue decreased to from for the twelve month period ended december   compared to the same periods in the prior year 
since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which carry different gross margins  our future margins will vary from quarter to quarter  and year to year based upon the mix of contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service we perform 
even within category types  the amount of gross margins generated might vary due to the unique nature and size of each contract and project we undertake 
this could impact our future profit margins and profit comparisons to historical levels 
during the twelve month period ended december   the early stage segment had higher than expected direct costs resulting in lower profit margins than historic levels 
this trend is expected to continue for the immediate future 
since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which carry different gross profit margins  our future gross profit margins will vary from quarter to quarter  and year to year based upon the mix of our contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects  and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service we perform 
even within category types  the amount of gross profit margins generated might vary due to the unique nature  and size of each contract and project we undertake 
this could impact our future gross profit margins and gross profit comparisons to historical levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses or sg a expenses increased to approximately million  an increase of for the twelve month period ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
as a percentage of direct revenue  our sg a expenses increased to approximately for the twelve months ended december  from for the same period in the increase in total sg a expenses from to is primarily attributable to significantly increased corporate expenses and other expenses consistent with the growth of revenues 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of revenues is attributable to lower than expected revenue growth in our early stage business and due to an increase in corporate expenses as a percentage of revenue 
in  corporate expenses increased approximately million to million compared to approximately million in these increases are primarily attributable to additional professional  legal and accounting fees of million  non cash compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r of million  management bonuses not paid of million  amortization of rsus of million and additional insurance  travel expense and salaries which totaled million 

table of contents for the twelve months ended december   we have incurred approximately million in rent expense for the toronto facility which is undergoing its initial fit out 
we expect to continue to record rent expense at this level for toronto 
other sg a expenses have increased due to expansion of our business  including additional administrative and other personnel costs  health and casualty insurance  increased sales  marketing  and business development efforts  amortization and depreciation expense and facility costs 
beginning  we expect an increase in sg a expenses as compared to levels to support our growth  primarily for rent  travel and business development expenses  and because of increased professional  legal and accounting fees  and increased insurance  director fees due to the expansion of the size of the board of directors and additional salary expense for new corporate positions 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded approximately million in amortization expense compared to approximately million for the same period in for the twelve months ended december  we recorded approximately million in depreciation expense compared to approximately million for the same period in interest income expense our interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense includes non cash amortization of deferred finance costs 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense of our line of credit due to lower outstanding balances offset by increased interest rates  and due to a reduction in write offs of deferred financing cost due to restructuring of the credit facility and the size of line of credit 
in we incurred a non cash write off of approximately million related to the write off of deferred charges due to repayment of approximately million on the term loan and conversion of the remaining term loan in a revolving line of credit of million 
in  we agreed to a reduction in the line of credit from million to the current level of million and as a result  we wrote off approximately million of deferred finance costs 
as of december  the balance outstanding on our credit facility was million 
as of march  the balance was million 
the current interest rate on this variable rate facility as of february  is approximately 
the remaining deferred financing costs as of december  of approximately million relating to convertible notes and the remaining credit facility will be amortized over a period of approximately three years and will be charged to interest expense 
in order to save interest charges on funds we are not borrowing  we may decide again to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity of our credit facility 
this would require us to write off additional deferred financing charges 
the write off of deferred financing charges may exceed the non cash interest savings for the year in which we reduce the maximum borrowing capacity 
interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to increased cash balances and higher interest rates on cash investment 
foreign exchange our foreign exchange loss increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the significant strengthening of the euro against the us dollar for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same period in we expect to increase our hedging activity in  however we cannot assure you that the current losses can be maintained or reduced with this increased activity 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was a benefit of compared to a tax expense of for this decrease was primarily attributable to a greater percentage of earnings generated from our foreign operations relative to our consolidated earnings 
the effective tax rate from our united states operations is substantially greater 
table of contents than our effective tax rate in canada and several key european countries 
as described elsewhere in this report  we receive significant tax credits from the government of canada relating to our research and development expenses 
these credits lower our effective tax rate in canada and in other countries where we operate 
we expect the nature of our early stage canadian business and the generation of significant tax credits to continue 
however  we cannot assure you as to the future amount of these credits on a quarterly or annual basis due to the mix of contracts and the related amounts of research and development activity 
our late stage business generates approximately of its net earnings from foreign operations 
our late stage business non us and non canadian operations are based in zumikon zurich switzerland where the effective tax rate of approximately is lower than the united states 
the swiss office subcontracts all work to the non us and non canadian pharmanet offices  and reimburses these offices for their operating costs  plus provides a markup depending on transfer pricing analysis on those operating costs 
the residual income in these non us and non canadian offices are taxed at their statutory rate which is generally to 
results from both continued and discontinued operations for the period ended december  generated significant us net operating losses 
we believe it is unlikely that the losses will be realized before the tax benefits expire 
a valuation allowance of million was provided for the us net operating loss carryforward of which million was allocated to continuing operations and million was allocated to discontinued operations 
our future effective tax rate will also be dependent on a number of factors  including the relative profits generated primarily in the united states  canada and europe  our ability to utilize canadian tax credits  the applicable foreign tax rates then in effect  transfer pricing  and our ability to generate us taxable income to utilize the nol and thereby release the valuation allowance 
earnings per share net earnings decreased from approximately million in to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to a material increase in the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax from million in to million in and due to a decrease in net earnings of million in from continuing operations compared to million in on a fully diluted basis  our earnings per share decreased from per share in to a loss of per share for the year ended december  the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a diluted basis increased from  for the year ended december  to  shares for the year ended december  the increase in the number of fully diluted shares resulted primarily from stock option exercise and the issuance of restricted shares and rsu s  some of which vested during in  we issued  shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units 
additionally  we issued restricted stock units to our independent directors upon their election in  and we issued restricted stock units to our executive officers in further  if the average stock price of our common stock during a reporting period is greater than  then shares reserved for issuance on possible conversion of our convertible senior notes will be included in calculating diluted shares outstanding in an amount equal to the difference between the conversion amount and the outstanding principal amount divided by 
the conversion amount will  for this purpose  be the principal amount divided by multiplied by the average stock price during the period 
our balance sheet contains an item entitled accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
this has no impact on our statement of operations and reflects the strengthening primarily of the canadian dollar and euro relative to the united states dollar and is calculated on december st 
in the future  other comprehensive earnings may increase or decrease depending upon the movement of various foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar and based upon the level of inter company activity outside of the united states

direct revenue our direct revenue  which does not include out of pocket expenses  was approximately million for the twelve month period ended december   which is an increase of approximately from approximately million in the comparable period in the primary components of this increase were pharmanet contributed approximately million in direct revenue in compared to zero in and to a lesser extent an increase in early stage revenues at anapharm  and a full year of revenue at taylor which we acquired in july our direct revenue increased primarily as the result of performing or managing more clinical trials and testing more samples  increases in the size of clinical trials and price increases 
the improvement in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar contributed to our increased net revenue and direct revenue  although as discussed below  the strengthening of the canadian dollar had a negative impact on our results of operations in in  the euro strengthened compared to the united states dollar which had a negative impact on revenue compared to however  it also had an offsetting positive impact to expenses 
direct costs direct costs as a percentage of direct revenue increased from to for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the improvement of early stage margins  offset by an increase in the direct costs due to the inclusion of our late stage business direct costs in our late stage business generally has slightly higher direct costs than our early stage business

this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operations at pharmanet 
the increase was also attributable to significant new purchases of bioanalytical equipment consistent with the growth of bioanalytical revenue and leasehold improvements including the build out of our toronto  canada bioanalytical laboratory 
sg a expenses include amortization which arose from the intangible assets we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
amortization expense increased from approximately million in to approximately million in  or an increase of  primarily as a result of the pharmanet acquisition 
interest income expense our interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense includes recurring non cash amortization and write off of deferred finance costs 
this increase was primarily attributable to a full year in of interest expense on our million convertible notes issued in august  which bear interest at an annual interest rate of  and due to interest expense on our credit facility entered into in december during the period ended march   we incurred a non cash charge of approximately million related to the write off of deferred charges due to repayment of million on the term loan 
in june  we incurred an additional non cash charge of million as a result of the amendment and repayment of approximately million on the term loan 
as of december  and march  the balance outstanding on our credit facility was million excluding accrued interest 
the current interest rate on this variable rate facility as of march  is approximately 
the remaining deferred financing costs of approximately million relating to convertible notes and the remaining credit facility will be amortized over a period of between five and six years and will be charged to interest expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to average reduced cash balances during the year as a result of loan repayments during interest expense on the loans significantly exceeded interest yields on available cash balances

on october   we entered into a fourth amendment  referred to herein as the amendment  to our credit facility with a syndicate of banks

the other material terms of the amendment i require us to provide the bank with additional financial reporting  ii permit us to enter into a sale leaseback transaction for its quebec city facility  and iii would require a temporary reduction in the amount of borrowing capacity under the credit facility to million in the event our trailing twelve month ebitda as defined in the credit facility  or ttm  is materially below  by a certain percentage  the forecasts provided to the bank 
if the total amount of our outstanding loans exceeds million at the time of the occurrence of such an event  we have no immediate obligation to repay these loans 
if the ttm exceeds this threshold in future periods  the full borrowing capacity of the credit facility will be restored to million 
in conjunction with the fourth amendment  the applicable margin with respect to libor loans were increased by basis points to and the applicable margin with respect to revolving loans that are prime rate loans were increased by basis points to  subject to change based upon certain leverage ratios 
the principal balance outstanding on the credit facility at december  was million and million at december  the outstanding balance on the credit facility as of december  is classified as long term debt since we amended the credit facility and is in compliance with the covenants and conditions 
the obligations under the credit facility is guaranteed by each of our us subsidiaries  is secured by a mortgage on its land and property in miami  florida  a pledge of all of the assets of our us operations and us subsidiaries  and a pledge of of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries

previously  a significant component of our business strategy was to seek to make acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and meet certain operational requirements 
although we continue to assess acquisition opportunities  its primary focus is on current operations 
if we consummate any acquisitions  we expect to use our existing cash  our credit facility to the extent available and  if necessary  obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund any such acquisitions 
except for stock to be issued in connection with restricted stock  rsus  employee options  and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan  we do not currently anticipate issuing any of our common stock during we anticipate spending between million and million in capital asset expenditures for  of which million will be used to complete the expansion of our new facility in quebec city  and the remaining capital asset expenditures will consist primarily of computer hardware  software  new bioanalytical equipment and maintenance capital expenditures 
in  anapharm purchased land and in  commenced building a new facility in quebec city  canada intended to house all of its clinical  bioanalytical operations as well as administrative functions 
in early  anapharm negotiated a build to suit arrangement with a building contractor 
subsequent to this arrangement  anapharm decided that it was advantageous to enter into a leasing arrangement for this location versus owning the property and building 
in october  anapharm completed a transaction with an investor 
under the terms of the agreement  the investor reimbursed anapharm approximately million which represented substantially all of the funds that anapharm had spent on the land purchase and construction 
additionally  the investor agreed to pay the contractor for the remaining building costs not to exceed approximately million 
since we continued to 
table of contents bear the risk of any cost overruns in excess of this level until the building was completed  and due to our continuing involvement in the building process  the transaction does not qualify as a sale leaseback accounting under the guidelines of fasb accounting for leases sale leaseback transaction involving real estate 
as of december   the investor had paid anapharm and the contractor a total of  as of march the building and improvements were substantially complete and on budget 
as of december   this transaction met the six criteria in determining if a long lived asset to be sold should be classified as held for sale in the period per fasb no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based upon our cash balances and cash flows from operations  we believe we have adequate working capital to meet our operational needs for the next months 
in order to provide a liquidity metric that enables investors to benchmark us against others in our industry  we calculate days sales outstanding  or dso s  for each three month period for continuing operations 
dso s are calculated by taking the consolidated accounts receivable balance for continuing operations at the end of a period and subtracting both short term and long term client advances balances for continuing operations at the end of the period 
the resulting number is divided by average net revenue per day for continuing operations for the three month period 
for the twelve month periods ended december   dso s were days  compared to days for the twelve months period ended december  the increase in dso s was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by our revenue growth 
we expect dso s to be approximately days for contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years credit facility and line of credit obligations convertible notes interest on convertible notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrants balance sheet under gaap total on or after august   we may at our option  redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on each of august   august  and august   holders may require us to re purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be re purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest 
off balance sheet commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and services from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing arrangements or more beneficial terms 
at december   these non cancelable purchase obligations were not materially different than those disclosed in the contractual commitments table contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  under our agreement with our joint venture partner in spain  we are required to fund the working capital of anapharm europe 
because that operation generates sufficient cash flow from operations  we have not had to provide it any working capital nor do we expect to be required to do so in the immediate future 
when we purchased new drug services  inc in  we agreed to pay the seller additional purchase consideration based upon new drug services future operating results over a three year period commencing september  although new drug services was profitable  except for approximately million in guaranteed payments  we have not paid any additional purchase consideration 
beginning in  we began 
table of contents tracking on a stand alone basis the core business of that subsidiary as it existed as of the date of acquisition and pharmanet began operating our charlotte  north carolina based late stage business 
as a result  we entered into an amendment of our earn out agreement 
based upon the profitability of the core business we paid million in april of to the former shareholders of new drug services  inc new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of analyzing the impact this interpretation will have on its financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and disclosures 
the fasb has recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas in order to measure fair value more clearly and provide guidance when its use is required by another standard 
sfas indicates that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset 
we will be required to adopt sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   no later than the quarter beginning january  we are currently in the process of evaluating sfas and have determined the impact  if any  sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

 sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of our financial statements and the related disclosures 
sab allows registrants to initially apply the approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the approach had always been used or recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with the related offset recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we decreased stockholders equity by approximately  on january  as a result of adopting sab the transition provisions of sab permit us to adjust for the cumulative effect on stockholders equity of errors relating to prior years that  under our previous approach of evaluating financial statement misstatements  were immaterial 
this decrease in stockholders equity consists of a decrease of approximately million due to an overstatement of deferred tax assets related to stock options exercises  and an increase of approximately million due to the overstatement of deferred tax expense on accumulated other comprehensive earnings and related deferred tax liabilities that commenced in with our acquisition of anapharm 
these adjustments impacted our balance sheet and the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies 
because of the tentative and preliminary nature of these proposed standards  management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents currency risk for the year ended december  our foreign revenue accounted for of the total revenue 
the significant growth of the foreign subsidiaries has created the need to engage in hedging activities to protect our forecasted growth 
we have focused in protecting our canadian as well as our european operations from currency fluctuations
