overview netscout systems  inc netscout or the company designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated products that enable performance management and optimization of complex  high speed networks  enabling delivery of critical business applications  services  and content efficiently to customers and end users 
we manufacture and market these products in an integrated hardware and software solution that has been used by commercial enterprises  large governmental agencies and telecommunication service providers worldwide 
we have a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop  manufacture and market our first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations and through the sale of netscout securities in conjunction with our initial public offering in august our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products  services and licenses and royalties sold  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  and current economic conditions 
in fiscal year  our total revenue increased million to million compared to million in fiscal year in addition  our cost of revenue  decreased by million to million compared to million in fiscal year gross profit of million or of revenue  in fiscal year increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal year our gross margin is primarily impacted by the mix and volume of our product and service revenue 
we realize significantly higher gross margins on service revenue relative to overall product revenue 
the total revenue increase in fiscal is attributable to a growth in service revenue 
our operating expenses  which include research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  amortization of acquired intangible assets and in process research and development expenses increased in fiscal year by million to million  compared to million in fiscal year primary contributors to this increase in overall expenses were a million increase in sales compensation including commissions  salary expense  incentive compensation  and other personnel costs  which increased mainly due to increased revenue attainment and higher attainment of sales incentive programs  and increased headcount  the recording of a million charge related to the retirement of the company s co founder and outgoing chairman  an thousand increase in sales travel  which increased due to higher revenue attainment and increased headcount  and a thousand increase in share based compensation expense due to our adoption of sfas r share based payment on april  net income for fiscal year increased by million to million compared to net income of million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million that resulted from higher revenue attainment  an increase of million in interest income due to higher interest rates and larger cash balances and a lower annual effective tax rate due to a change in investment mix towards tax exempt securities and current changes of prior estimates relating to tax deductions and credits in connection with the completion of the fiscal tax return during the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of million 
we are continuing to see significant benefit from operating leverage and remain focused on increasing our operating margin by growing revenue while containing expenses 
this is largely driven by year over year revenue growth of led by service revenue growth 
in addition  we improved profitability  delivering a increase in net income over the fiscal year ended march  we continue to see increased focus by the market and our customers on the importance of application performance monitoring from within the network 
as networks and applications become increasingly complex and web services and service oriented architectures become more pervasive  our products are ideally positioned for this new paradigm 
during fiscal year we released a number of new products that will help our customers stay ahead of performance issues across large  globally distributed enterprise  service provider  and government networks 
first  we introduced an intelligent early warning system for network and application performance with the delivery of ngenius analytics  a product based on technology which we acquired from quantiva 
the ngenius analytics product works together with the rest of the ngenius performance management system to add highly qualified  early notifications of emerging performance problems  so operations staff can address them before services are impacted 
we followed that with the release of our ngenius application fabric monitor afmon  a multi purpose  high capacity  robust instrumentation appliance that combines the real time performance monitoring and alarming capabilities of our ngenius probe products with the streaming  full packet capture functions of our ngenius flow recorder 
the ngenius afmon is a powerful one box solution for the ultimate in high definition visibility true real time monitoring coupled with a complete packet record for detailed  reconstructive  sub second forensic analysis 
later in fiscal  we introduced the industry s most cost effective approach for large scale deployments of performance monitoring based on netflow  via a compelling site license approach 
at the same time  we expanded our solutions by adding support for cisco s ipsla test agents  bringing valuable voice over internet protocol voip quality metrics into our reporting and analysis capabilities 
finally  we formally launched our technology solutions for the telecommunications service provider community with the announcement that we are adapting our ngenius performance management system to the special needs of monitoring ip based services  especially within mobile communications networks 
this important new area of our business is made possible by the continued march of public telecommunications towards internet protocol ip as a primary network transport  and is also testament to the flexibility and adaptability of our ngenius solution to the special needs of specific industry verticals 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of inventories  valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets  capitalization of software development costs  purchased and internal use software  share based compensation  and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide three months of software support and months of hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the software support is recognized ratably over the three month support period 
revenue related to the hardware support is recognized ratably over the month support period 
after the expiration of these initial support periods  the customer may elect to purchase an extended support agreement that typically runs for an additional months 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the work is performed 
license and royalty revenue consists primarily of royalties under license agreements by original equipment manufacturers that incorporate components of our data collection technology into their own products or reproduce and sell our software products 
license revenue is recognized when delivery of the original equipment manufacturer s product has occurred and when we become contractually entitled to receive license fees  provided that such fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon reported product shipments by the license holder 
multi element arrangements are customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the purchase is analyzed and a portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
under the residual method  the remaining portion of the purchase price is allocated to the delivered elements  generally hardware and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a semi annual basis and update  when appropriate  our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value 
as of march  and  we recorded net realizable value adjustments of thousand and thousand  respectively 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our net realizable value adjustment is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect its net realizable value 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the net realizable value adjustment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill was million as of march  and  respectively 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our enterprise exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill analysis 
at times  the market capitalization of our common stock may decline temporarily below our stockholders equity  however  we do not believe that any temporary decline below our stockholders equity would necessarily indicate impairment 
if adverse economic or industry trends or a decrease in customer demand result in a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period in the future  we would need to assess an impairment loss 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and an asset is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   based upon our review  we determined that there has been no goodwill impairment 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets was thousand and million as of march  and  respectively 
we account for our acquired intangible assets at historical cost 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets is recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis 
our acquired intangible assets include software and non compete agreements  resulting from the acquisition of quantiva s business on april  see note and note 
we had no in process research and development expense for the fiscal year ended march  in process research and development expense was thousand for the fiscal year ended march  due to the acquisition of quantiva s business 
in process research and development was identified and valued by management 
the amount assigned to in process research and development was determined by identifying the specific projects that would be continued and for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date and which had no alternative future use 
the cost approach  as represented by time invested by quantiva programmers  was used in valuing the in process research and development 
we recognize that the income approach is the preferable valuation methodology 
however  due to the lack of a historical market for the technology  a meaningful cash flow projection could not be developed and therefore the cost approach was determined to be most appropriate 
capitalization of software development costs  purchased software and internal use software costs incurred in the research and development of our products  including the various small point releases and small product enhancements that are released throughout each fiscal year  are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility as defined by sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed and capitalized thereafter  until the related software products are available for first customer shipment 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
amortization of capitalized software development costs are charged to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over two years 
we also capitalizes acquired software in accordance with sfas during the twelve months ended march   we met technological feasibility for our ngenius analytics product 
capitalized costs included payroll and payroll related costs for employees who were directly associated with and devoted time to the project and who were working on software development tasks eligible for capitalization  such as design requirements  development  infrastructure  testing and project management 
general and administrative costs and overhead costs were not capitalized 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we began selling the ngenius analytics product 
as of march   capitalized software development costs for internally developed software were thousand and accumulated amortization of such costs was thousand  resulting in net capitalized software costs of thousand included on the balance sheet under capitalized software development costs  net 
capitalized software development costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based upon anticipated future revenue for these software products and changes in product technologies 
unamortized capitalized software development costs that are determined to be in excess of their net realizable value will be expensed in the period in which such a determination is made 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing the net realizable value of unamortized software development costs 
if our accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  we may expense such software development costs immediately and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
during the twelve months ended march   we capitalized million of acquired software obtained in connection with the acquisition of quantiva s business note 
amortization of acquired purchased software is recorded on a straight line basis over three years from the date of the purchase 
amortization was thousand for the twelve months ended march  we considered the economic consumption method alternative for amortizing these costs and determined that the straight line method was preferable given the amount of subjectivity involved in projecting the timing of cash flows related to the acquired quantiva software 
acquired capitalized software of is included on the balance sheet within acquired intangible assets  net 
we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system in order to better manage the growth and increasing complexity of our business and to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal control over financial reporting 
certain costs that are incurred in the procurement and development of this erp system are capitalized in accordance with sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
preliminary project planning costs associated with the project were expensed as incurred 
once we executed contracts with third parties and committed to develop the software system  capitalization of eligible costs began 
capitalized costs to date include fees paid for the purchase of software  fees paid to third parties to develop customizations to the software during the application development stage  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the software project and who are working on software development tasks such as design requirements  development  infrastructure  testing and project management 
general and administrative costs and overhead costs are not capitalized 
as of march   capitalized software costs relating to the erp system implementation totaled million 
amortization of internal use software will be recorded on a straight line basis over five years once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  which is currently expected to be in fiscal year share based compensation effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective application transition method  and therefore has not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after april  and those shares granted in prior periods but not yet vested as of april   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas r s adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price  granted restricted stock units  or granted options to non employees 
based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors  and a forfeiture rate for our senior executives and remaining employees 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulted in pre tax income of thousand and was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we estimate our quarterly income tax expense based on our projected annual effective tax rate 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing our projected annual effective tax rate 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of these assets and liabilities as well as on acquired or incurred net operating loss carryforward amounts 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we believe future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of net deferred tax assets 
as of march   deferred income tax assets were million  consisting primarily of million of other temporary book and tax accounting differences 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  require a valuation allowance 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred income taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets will be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made

product revenue remained relatively flat compared to the prior year 
an increase of approximately in average selling price per unit  resulting from product mix  was offset by a decrease of approximately in unit sales compared to the prior year 
the decrease in unit sales and the increase in average selling price were due to sales of higher capacity products  including some of our new product introductions 
these higher capacity products are often deployed in smaller numbers by our customers in place of a larger deployment of smaller  lower priced products  resulting in higher average selling prices  lower unit volumes and higher transaction sizes 
service 
the or million increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales  combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our expanding product installed base

guarantor s agreements the company warrants that its software and hardware products will substantially conform to the documentation accompanying such products on their original date of shipment 
for software  which also includes firmware  the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires ninety days thereafter 
for hardware  the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires twelve months thereafter 
this warranty is subject to various exclusions which include but are not limited to non conformance resulting from modifications made to the software or hardware by a party other than the company 
the company also warrants that all support services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner 
the company believes that its product and support services warranties are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards

contracts that the company enters into in the ordinary course of business may contain indemnification provisions 
pursuant to these agreements  the company may agree to defend any third party claims brought against a partner or direct customer claiming infringement of such third party s i us patent and or european union eu or other selected countries patents  ii berne convention member country copyright  and or iii us  eu  and or other selected countries trademark or intellectual property rights 
moreover  this indemnity may require the company to pay any damages awarded against the partner or direct customer in such type of lawsuit as well as reimburse the partner or direct customer for any reasonable attorney s fees incurred by them from the lawsuit 
on limited occasions  the company may agree to provide other forms of indemnification to partners or direct customers  such as indemnification that would obligate the company to defend and pay any damages awarded to a third party against a partner or direct customer based on a lawsuit alleging that such third party has suffered personal injury and or tangible property damage legally determined to have been caused by negligently designed or manufactured products 
the term associated with these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that the company could be required to pay arising from indemnification agreements may be limited to a certain monetary value 
however  the monetary exposure associated with the majority of these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
historically  the company has incurred no costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements and believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial 
if the company were to have to defend a lawsuit and settle claims  the costs could potentially have a material impact on the company s financial results

cash to be used under this program in the future is undeterminable at this point in time 
we believe that our cash balances  marketable securities classified as available for sale and any future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs could be materially impacted 
additionally  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
recent accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting fin but does not expect that it will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills and municipal bonds 
netscout s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents 
netscout s exposure to interest rates based on outstanding debt has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that we currently have a million line of credit with no amounts outstanding under the line and no other outstanding interest bearing debt 
netscout s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been limited 
all revenue transactions are executed in us dollars 
netscout pays for certain foreign operating expenses such as foreign payroll  rent and office expense in foreign currency and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  netscout does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in the period incurred
