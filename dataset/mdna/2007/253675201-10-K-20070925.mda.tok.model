commitments and contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases green coffee commitments

we have also entered into employment agreements with two executives that provide for severance payments in the event that these individuals are terminated without cause or that they terminate their employment as a result of a constructive termination 
these severance payments range from six months to one year s salary 
our company s maximum liability for severance under the contracts is currently  because such amounts are contingent they have not been included in the above table 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for our coffee houses  roasting facility and administrative offices 
lease terms are generally for to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
some retail leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
in addition  we are liable on the master leases for franchised locations 
under our historical franchising business model  we executed the master leases for these locations  and entered into subleases on the same terms with our franchisees  which typically pay their rent directly to the landlords 
should any of these franchisees default on their subleases  we would be responsible for making payments thereunder 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at june   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases  was  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures that we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump sum payment to the landlord that is less than the sum of all remaining future rents and other amounts payable 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
accounts significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  franchise receivables  allowance for bad debt reserves  fixed asset lives  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  self insurance and workers compensation reserves  store closure reserves  stock based compensation  the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion  however  does not list all of our accounting policies and estimates 
impairment of property and equipment and other amortizable long lived assets held and used each quarter  or upon the occurrence of a triggering event as defined in sfas no 
 we evaluate the carrying value of individual stores when the operating results have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or a current expectation that a store will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the store was opened or remodeled  and the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth 
for stores selected for review  we estimate the future cash flows from operating the store over its estimated useful life 
we make judgments about future same store sales and the operating expenses and estimated useful life that we would expect with such level of same store sales 
the most significant assumptions in our analysis are those used when we estimate a unit s future cash flows 
we generally use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on unit specific information 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating unit assets may be overstated or understated 
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has likely occurred 
we consider the reporting unit level to be the segment level since the components within each segment have similar economic characteristics  including products and services  production processes  types or classes of customers and distribution methods 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the segment 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
for fiscal year  an independent third party analysis of the fair value of the wholesale and franchise operating segments was conducted to determine whether any potential impairment to the goodwill associated with the operating segments was appropriate 
the definition of value used in this analysis was fair value  which is defined as the amount at which an asset or assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced sale or liquidation 
the determination of fair value of the operating segments was based on financial statements and projections supplied by management in addition to current and future economic  market and competitive conditions  and other relevant factors 
in addition  a sensitivity analysis was completed to determine at what point impairment of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the wholesale business segment would be appropriate 
using historical trends and the projected growth rates  the sensitivity analysis indicates that an annual decline in cash flow into perpetuity would trigger a potential impairment of the goodwill associated with the wholesale business segment 
the wholesale business segment has experienced significant revenue growth over the past two years averaging approximately average annual growth from fiscal year to fiscal year this wholesale business segment is not on a declining revenue growth curve  but instead is experiencing significant growth in revenue 

table of contents though the gloria jean s domestic franchise operating segment has experienced declining revenue in recent years  the business segment has relatively few assets other than the associated goodwill 
however  the analysis indicates that it would require a significant drop in the franchise store count  approximately  before the gloria jean s franchise operations business segment carrying value exceeded its calculated fair value 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the segments may ultimately prove to be significantly higher or lower  thereby causing the carrying value to be less than or to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has or has not occurred 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our goodwill may be understated or overstated 
our annual impairment measurement date is our fiscal year end 
estimated liability for closing stores we make decisions to close stores based on prospects for estimated future profitability and sometimes we are forced to close stores due to circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new lease 
our management team evaluates each store s performance every period 
when stores continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of an unprofitable store 
based on the management team s judgment  we estimate the future net cash flows 
if we determine that the store will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  and we are not contractually obligated to continue operating the store  we may close the store 
additionally  franchisees may close stores for which we are the primary lessee 
if the franchisee cannot make payments on the lease  we continue making the lease payments and establish an estimated liability for the closed store if we decide not to operate it as a company operated store 
effective january   we established the estimated liability on the actual closure date which is generally the date on which we cease to receive economic benefit from the unit 
we also review the net cash flows to determine the need to provide for asset impairment 
the estimated liability for closing stores on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee that we expect to pay  as well as the estimated maintenance costs that we expect to pay until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability is generally the present value of the estimated future payments 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown in provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs or cost of sales and related occupancy  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing stores is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant stores  which we determine based on our assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early terminations of our lease agreements with the lessors or to sublease the property 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or sublease or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant stores are not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant stores are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities through the line item in which it was originally recorded  resulting in an increase in operating income 
estimated liability for self insurance and workers compensation we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation insurance for policy years ended prior to october  we obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation claims with a  deductible per occurrence and a program maximum for all claims of  insurance liabilities and reserves are accounted for based on the present value of actuarial estimates of the amount of incurred and 
table of contents unpaid losses  based approximately on a risk free interest rate 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
management  in determining the estimated liability  bases the assumptions on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development we estimated in conjunction with the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve 
as a result  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims are greater than expected  then we may adjust the expected losses upward and our future self insurance expenses will rise 
franchised operations we monitor the financial condition of certain franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each period we perform an analysis to develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
over time  our assessment of individual franchisees may change 
for instance  we have had franchisees for whom we had estimated a loss equal to the total amount of their receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we or our franchisees may take to resolve franchise collections issues 
these actions may include the purchase of franchise stores by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement  which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future  a restructuring of the franchisee s business or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary or secondary obligee or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   an estimated liability for future lease obligations on stores operated by franchisees for which we are the primary or secondary obligee is established on the date the franchisee closes the store 
also  we record an estimated liability for subsidized lease payments when we sign a sublease agreement committing us to the subsidy 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing stores above 
consistent with sfas no 
 we have not established an additional estimated liability for potential losses not yet incurred 
if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised stores 
in addition  entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
stock based compensation as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various stock based compensation plans that provide options for certain employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of stock 
prior to june   we elected to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no

because of this election  we were required to make certain disclosures of pro forma net income assuming we had adopted sfas no 
starting june   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  which sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees and non employee directors  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 

table of contents we determine the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including our historical stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies as discussed above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
if we have been profitable for a number of years and our prospects for the realization of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not  we would then reverse our valuation allowance and credit income tax expense 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from future taxable income 
as of june   our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance totaled approximately  new accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no

other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business experiences some variations in sales from quarter to quarter due to the holiday season and other factors including  but not limited to  general economic trends  competition  marketing programs and the weather 
the fall and winter months are generally the best sales months but our geographic and product line diversity provide for some sales stability in the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily 
table of contents decreases 
as a result of these factors  and of the other contingencies and risk factors described elsewhere in this report  the financial results for any individual quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive items entered into for trading purposes none 
market risk sensitive items entered into for other than trading purposes we have exposure to market risk from two primary sources interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
at june   we had a  note facility with no outstanding balance  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
at fiscal year end  the interest rate was 
during our fiscal year  three month libor rates ranged from to commodity price risk green coffee  the principal raw material for our products  is subject to significant price fluctuations caused by a number of factors  including weather  political  and economic conditions 
to date  we have not used commodity based financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in the price of green coffee 
to ensure that we have an adequate supply of green coffee  however  we enter into agreements to purchase green coffee in the future that may or may not be fixed as to price 
at june   we had commitments to purchase coffee through fiscal year  totaling  for  pounds of green coffee  the majority of which were fixed as to price 
the coffee scheduled to be delivered to us in fiscal year pursuant to these commitments will satisfy approximately of our anticipated green coffee requirements for the fiscal year 
assuming we require approximately  additional pounds of green coffee during fiscal for which no price has yet been fixed  each per pound increase in the price of green coffee could result in  of additional cost 
however  because the price we pay for green coffee is negotiated with suppliers independent of the commodities market we believe that the commodity market price for green coffee  in general  would have to increase significantly  by as much as per pound  before suppliers would increase the price they charge us
