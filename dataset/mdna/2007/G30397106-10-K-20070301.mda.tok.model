our investments in other ventures had a carrying value of million at december   which approximates fair value 
adjustments to the carrying value of these investments are made based upon the net valuation criteria established by the managers of the alternative funds 
these net valuations are established based upon the valuation criteria in the governing documents of the alternative funds 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares or partnership interests of the alternative funds 
due to a delay in the valuations reported by the fund managers  our investments in these alternative funds are generally reported on a one month lag 
many of the alternative funds are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sale which are determined by the governing documents and thereby limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
interest income  income distributions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on our investments in the alternative funds are included in net investment income and totaled million for the year ended we have engaged our investment managers to provide investment advisory and management services 
we have agreed to pay investment management fees  which vary depending on the amount of assets under management  and are included in net investment income 
these agreements may be terminated by either party upon written notice

during the year ended december   the company identified securities which were considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
consequently  the cost of such securities was written down to fair value at the time of impairment  and the company realized losses of million in relation to these securities for nil  nil 
ratings ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
during  s p undertook a review of our ratings and upgraded the financial strength rating of endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries to an a strong  with a stable outlook 
also during  am best undertook a review of endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries and reaffirmed a financial strength rating of a excellent  with a positive outlook 
endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries maintain a moody s rating of a  with a stable outlook 
the objective of am best s and s p s rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer s or reinsurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders 
these ratings reflect am best s and s p s opinions of our capitalization  performance and management  and are not applicable to our securities and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold such securities 
am best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from a superior to f in liquidation  and includes separate ratings categories 
within these categories  a superior and a superior are the highest  followed by a excellent and a excellent 
publications of am best indicate that the a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have demonstrated an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
these ratings are subject to periodic review by  and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of  am best 
the rating a excellent by am best is the fourth highest of rating levels 
s p maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa extremely strong to r under regulatory supervision 
within these categories  aaa extremely strong is the highest  followed by aa  aa and aa very strong and a  a and a strong 
publications of s p indicate that the a  a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in s p s opinion  have demonstrated strong financial security characteristics  but are somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
these ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of s p 
the rating a strong by s p is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
moody s maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa to c 
within these categories  aaa is the highest  followed by aa and a 
within each of these categories  ratings are further broken down into aa  aa and aa ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of moody s 
the rating a by moody s is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
competition the insurance and reinsurance industries are mature and highly competitive 
insurance and reinsurance companies compete on the basis of many factors  including premium charges  general reputation and perceived financial strength  the terms and conditions of the products offered  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation and experience in the particular risk to be underwritten  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered  premiums charged and other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered 
these factors operate at the individual market participant level and in the aggregate across the insurance and reinsurance industry more generally 
in addition  background economic conditions and variations in the insurance and reinsurance buying practices of insureds and ceding companies  by participant and in the aggregate  contribute to cyclical movements in insurance and reinsurance rates  terms and conditions and ultimately insurance and reinsurance industry aggregate financial results 
we compete in the bermuda  us  london and international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties  including established global insurance and reinsurance companies  other start up insurance and reinsurance entities  as well as potential capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing catastrophe and other risks 
many of these entities have significantly larger amounts of capital and more employees than endurance holdings and its subsidiaries and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in our insurance business segment  where competition tends to be focused more on availability  service and considerations other than price  we compete with insurers that provide property and casualty based lines of insurance in each of our markets as follows north america ace ltd 
ace  american international group aig  arch capital group ltd 
arch  factory mutual insurance company  rli corp  axis capital holdings group axis and zurich financial services group zurich 
europe ace  allianz ag  lloyd s  royal sun alliance insurance group plc and zurich

in general  we believe operating conditions in in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace were more favorable for our property lines of business  especially for us risks having coastal storm and earthquake exposure 
operating conditions for our insurance and reinsurance casualty lines were more challenging in pricing pressures and increased capacity were seen in many of our casualty lines 
however  we retained our underwriting discipline throughout this period by turning away business when terms and conditions did not meet our underwriting requirements 
in  we expect to experience increased competition in certain catastrophe exposed segments of our business 
this increased competition is expected to emerge as a result of the increased levels of capital held by companies  along with reductions in demand for insurance and reinsurance in certain catastrophe exposed markets 
this shift has the potential to produce a mismatch between the supply and demand for insurance and reinsurance products and may result in price reductions for some of our products 
outside of the catastrophe exposed risks  we expect a generally stable to slightly declining pricing environment 
employees as of february   we had full time employees 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements

item a 
risk factors before investing in any of our securities  you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
these risks could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition and cause the trading price of our securities to decline 
you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our business if actual claims exceed our reserve for losses and loss expenses  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure or reinsure 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
loss reserve estimates are refined continually in an ongoing process as experience develops and claims are reported and settled 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
moreover  these uncertainties are greater for companies like us than for those with a longer operating history because we do not yet have an extensive loss history 
because of this uncertainty  it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate 
to the extent we determine that actual losses and loss expenses exceed our expectations and loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  we will be required to immediately increase our reserve for losses and loss expenses 
this could cause a material reduction in our profitability and capital 
as a property and catastrophe insurer and reinsurer  we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes 
our property and catastrophe insurance and reinsurance lines expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  including earthquakes  hurricanes  hailstorms  severe winter weather  floods  fires  tornadoes  volcano eruptions  explosions and other natural or man made disasters 
the global geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas throughout the world  including  but not limited to  windstorms in the united kingdom and continental europe  hurricanes in florida  the gulf coast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states  typhoons and earthquakes in japan and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states 
the loss experience of property catastrophe insurers and reinsurers has generally been characterized as low frequency but high severity in nature 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
in the event that we experience catastrophe losses  there is a possibility that our premiums will be inadequate to cover these risks 
in addition  because accounting regulations do not permit insurers and reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur  claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to write new business also could be adversely impacted 
see item business underwriting and risk management 
as a property and casualty insurer and reinsurer  we could face losses from war  terrorism and political unrest 
we may have substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable  although recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity 
it is difficult to predict their occurrence with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate 
accordingly  it is possible that our loss reserves will be inadequate to cover these risks 
we closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under insurance policies and reinsurance treaties 
we often seek to exclude terrorism when we cannot reasonably evaluate the risk of loss or charge an appropriate premium for such risk 
even in cases where we have deliberately sought to exclude coverage  we may not be able to eliminate completely our exposure to terrorist acts  and thus it is possible that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us 
the risks associated with property and casualty reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
because we participate in property and casualty reinsurance markets  the success of our underwriting efforts depends  in part  upon the policies  procedures and expertise of the ceding companies making the original underwriting decisions 
we face the risk that these ceding companies may fail to accurately assess the risks that they assume initially  which  in turn  may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume 
if we fail to establish and receive appropriate premium rates  we could face significant losses on these contracts 
if actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our contracts are generally for a one year term 
in our financial forecasting process  we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s contracts 
if actual renewals do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a large number of reinsurance contracts are subject to renewal 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or on our results of operations 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing many of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client  establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event and following prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
most of our direct liability insurance policies include maximum aggregate limitations 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure through geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and whether a policy falls within particular zone limits 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
as a result  various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our other loss limitation methods may prove to be ineffective 
underwriting is a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more future catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
we may be unable to purchase reinsurance and our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of an unusual loss experience 
we purchase reinsurance if it is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or if it is expected to have a favorable cost benefit relationship relative to our retained risk portfolio 
changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control  may reduce to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to balance exposures across our reinsurance or insurance operations 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain such reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to our clients 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and  depending upon the amount of reinsurance we have purchased  could cause us to incur a significant loss 
since we are dependent on key executives  the loss of any of these executives or our inability to retain other key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of kenneth j 
lestrange  our chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board of directors  michael j 
mcguire  our chief financial officer  michael e 
angelina  chief actuary and risk officer and david s 
cash  our chief underwriting officer 
we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining key personnel since our inception 
the loss of any of their services or the services of other members of our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the further implementation of our business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
we will need to continue to hire employees to work in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
in  the bermuda government announced a new policy limiting the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees 
all of our bermuda based professional employees who require work permits  including messrs 
lestrange  mcguire and angelina  have been granted permits by the bermuda government 
the terms of these permits range from three to five years depending on the individual 
it is possible that we could lose the services of one or more of our key employees if we are unable to obtain or renew their work permits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a decline in the financial strength ratings of endurance bermuda  endurance uk  endurance uk reinsurance or endurance uk insurance could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
we currently maintain an am best financial strength rating of a excellent with a positive outlook and an s p financial strength rating of a strong with a stable outlook 
if our ratings are reduced from their current level by am best or s p  our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry would suffer 
such a downgrade may have a material negative impact on our ability to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements  require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their reinsurance contracts with us on terms disadvantageous to us 
in addition  a downgrade of our am best rating below b one level below our current rating would constitute an event of default under our bank credit facility 
each of the effects of a downgrade of our financial strength rating described above could make it more expensive or otherwise difficult for us to compete in certain business segments in which we would otherwise desire to operate 
if this were to occur  we could suffer a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  and the market price for our securities  including any ordinary shares  could be materially and adversely affected 
our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
endurance holdings is a holding company and  as such  has no substantial operations of its own 
dividends and other permitted distributions from insurance subsidiaries are expected to be endurance holdings primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  if any  to shareholders 
bermuda law and regulations  including  but not limited to  bermuda insurance regulations  restrict the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions by endurance bermuda unless certain regulatory requirements are met 
the inability of endurance bermuda to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable endurance holdings to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
in addition  endurance uk  endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
we therefore do not expect to receive dividends from these subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 
endurance holdings is subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect its ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares  class a shares and non cumulative preferred shares  series a the series a preferred shares  and make other payments 
under the bermuda companies act  as amended the companies act  endurance holdings may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of retained earnings or contributed surplus only if it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  able to pay its liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility prohibit endurance holdings from declaring or paying any dividends if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such declaration or payment or would result from such declaration or payment 
in addition  the terms of the series a preferred shares prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends on our ordinary shares unless dividends on the series a preferred shares have been declared and paid 
preference shares  including the series a preferred shares  may also not be redeemed if as a result of the redemption  our issued share capital would be reduced below the minimum capital specified in the memorandum of association of endurance holdings 
for a discussion of the legal limitations on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to endurance holdings and of endurance holdings to pay dividends to its shareholders  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the cost of reinsurance security arrangements may materially impact our margins 
as a bermuda reinsurer  endurance bermuda is required to post collateral security with respect to reinsurance liabilities it assumes from ceding insurers domiciled in the us the posting of collateral security is generally required in order for us ceding companies to obtain credit on their us statutory financial statements with respect to reinsurance liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers  such as endurance bermuda 
under applicable statutory provisions  the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit  reinsurance trusts maintained by third party trustees or funds withheld arrangements whereby the trusteed assets are held by the ceding company 
endurance bermuda has the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit under our letter of credit and revolving credit facility that expires on april  if this facility is not sufficient or if the company is unable to renew this facility or is unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms  the ability of endurance bermuda to provide reinsurance to us based clients may be severely limited 
security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to  or otherwise held by  third parties 
although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit  the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer  which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda law 
the restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
our investment performance may affect our financial assets and ability to conduct business 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio  which consists primarily of fixed maturities 
our income derived from our invested assets including net realized losses was million for the year ended december  our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
in addition  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk as well as restrictions on redemptions or sale of certain of our investments 
with respect to our liabilities  we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes their cash flow profile and resulting potential liquidity needs 
in that regard  we attempt to correlate the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio to our liability profile 
however  if our liquidity needs or liability profile unexpectedly change  we may not be successful in continuing to structure our investment portfolio in that manner 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments will be subject to fluctuations depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we take measures to attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
a significant portion of the investment portfolio matures each year  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
the portfolio is actively managed  and trades are made to balance our exposure to interest rates 
however  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance uk  which is denominated in british sterling 
in addition  we enter into reinsurance and insurance contracts where we are obligated to pay losses in currencies other than us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross premiums  prior to deposit accounting adjustments  were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and loss reserves are also denominated in non us currencies 
the majority of our operating foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen and australian dollars major currencies 
we may  from time to time  experience losses from fluctuations in the values of these and other non us currencies  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we periodically buy and sell major currencies or investment securities denominated in major currencies in an attempt to match our non us dollar assets to our related non us dollar liabilities 
we have no currency hedges in place  however  as part of our matching strategy  we consider the use of hedges when we become aware of probable significant losses that will be paid in non us currencies 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully match our exposures or structure the hedges so as to effectively manage these risks 
we may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully  to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  and to maintain our current rating agency ratings 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
in the year ended december   our top four brokers represented approximately of our gross premiums written before deposit accounting adjustments 
see item business distribution 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance or reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
to date we have not experienced any losses related to such credit risks 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include

increased litigation and regulatory involvement in the claims settlement process from claims arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business 
we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely impact our operating margins 
the insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive 
we compete with major us and us insurers and reinsurers  including other bermuda based insurers and reinsurers 
for information regarding competition in each of our business segments  see item business business segments 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources 
a number of newly organized  bermuda based insurance and reinsurance entities compete in the same market segments in which we operate 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the segments of the insurance and reinsurance market in which we operate or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
increasing competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
further  insurance risk linked securities and derivative and other non traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties  including non insurance company entities  which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry 
new competition from these developments could cause the demand for insurance or reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our growth and profitability 
the historical cyclicality of the property and casualty reinsurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results 
historically  property and casualty reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and other factors 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers and prevailing general economic conditions 
the supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry 
as a result  the reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
although rates for many products have generally increased since our formation  and remain above our benchmark rates  the supply of reinsurance may increase  either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing reinsurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
we are beginning to see more competition across many of the lines of business in which we participate 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and conditions and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insurers may affect the cycles of the reinsurance business significantly  and we expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in new businesses 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations  or may be able to do so only at great cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see regulatory matters below 
risks related to taxation we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given endurance holdings and endurance bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to endurance holdings  endurance bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  however  it is possible that after march  we may be subject to bermuda taxes 
we and our subsidiaries may be subject to us tax which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
endurance holdings and endurance bermuda are bermuda companies and endurance uk is an english company 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk each intend to operate in such a manner that none of these companies will be deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the united states 
nevertheless  because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states is not provided by the code  or regulations or court decisions  the internal revenue service irs might contend that any of endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are is engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk were engaged in a trade or business in the united states  and if endurance uk or endurance bermuda were to qualify for benefits under the applicable income tax treaty with the united states  but such trade or business were attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states or in the case of endurance bermuda  with respect to investment income  arguably even if such income were not attributable to a permanent establishment  endurance holdings  endurance uk and or endurance bermuda would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income that is effectively connected with the us trade or business  plus an additional branch profits tax in certain circumstances  in which case our financial condition and results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected 
holders of endurance holdings ordinary shares or series a preferred shares who own or more of our voting power may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
certain us shareholders of a foreign corporation that is considered a controlled foreign corporation a cfc for us federal income tax purposes must include in gross income such us shareholder s pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
due to the dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of its shares entitled to vote and authorize endurance holdings to purchase such shares under certain circumstances  and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
it is possible  however  that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge 
accordingly  investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the cfc rules to an investment in endurance holdings 
us persons who hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares may be subject to us income taxation on their pro rata share of our related party insurance income rpii 
the cfc rules apply to certain insurance and reinsurance companies that earn rpii 
if the rpii rules were to apply to endurance uk or endurance bermuda  a us person who owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares of endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately to such us shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although endurance uk and endurance bermuda intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons rpii companies  rpii exceptions 
the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the shares  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares because endurance holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us treasury department  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  the irs might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares

we believe that we should not be considered a pfic for us federal income purposes for the year ended december  moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that would cause us to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we could be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the year or any future year 
if we were considered a pfic it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming

regulatory matters general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers 
bermuda the insurance act of bermuda and related regulations  as amended the insurance act  regulates the insurance business of endurance bermuda and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the bma under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is registered as a class insurer by the bma  however  as a holding company  endurance holdings is not subject to bermuda insurance regulations 
insurance  as well as reinsurance  is regulated under the insurance act 
the bma  in deciding whether to grant registration  has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest 
the bma is required by the insurance act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and  in particular  whether a it has fulfilled the minimum criteria with respect to the body corporate  b it has  or has available to it  adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business and c the premises intended to be used in the business are adequate for the conduct of the business 
the continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to it complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the bma may impose from time to time 
an insurance advisory committee appointed by the bermuda minister of finance the minister advises the bma on matters connected with the discharge of the bma s functions 
sub committees of the insurance advisory committee supervise and review the law and practice of insurance in bermuda  including reviews of accounting and administrative procedures 
the day to day supervision of insurers is the responsibility of the bma 
the insurance act also imposes on bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate  require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
the bma utilizes a risk based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance companies in bermuda 
we believe that the bma s risk based approach will not have a material impact on endurance bermuda s operations 
as part of the bma s risk based system  an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer is utilized in the first instance to determine the limitations and specific requirements which may be imposed 
thereafter the bma keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis  including through the scrutiny of regular audited statutory financial statements  and  as appropriate  meeting with senior management during onsite visits 
the initial meetings with senior management and any proposed onsite visit will primarily focus upon companies that are licensed as class and class insurers 
the bma has also recently adopted guidance notes  or the guidance notes  in order to ensure those operating in bermuda have a good understanding of the nature of the requirements of  and the bma s approach in implementing  the insurance act 
classification of insurers the insurance act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long term business and insurers carrying on general business 
there are four classifications of insurers carrying on general business  with class insurers subject to the strictest regulation 
endurance bermuda  which is incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business  is registered as a class insurer in bermuda and is regulated as such under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is not licensed to carry on long term business 
cancellation of insurer s registration an insurer s registration may be canceled by the supervisor of insurance of the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the insurance act or if  in the opinion of the bma after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
principal representative an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  endurance bermuda s principal office is its executive offices in pembroke  bermuda 
michael j 
mcguire has been appointed by the board of directors as endurance bermuda s principal representative and has been approved by the bma 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless days notice in writing to bma is given of the intention to do so 
a principal representative shall forthwith notify the bma  in such a manner as it may direct  a on his reaching a view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent  b on its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe  that an event to which the applicable section of the insurance act applies has occurred 
within days of such notification  the principal representative shall furnish the bma with a report in writing setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
for example  the failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin or liquidity or other ratio would be a reportable event 
independent approved auditor every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report annually on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of endurance bermuda  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
endurance bermuda s independent auditor must be approved by the bma and may be the same person or firm that audits endurance holdings consolidated financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 
loss reserve specialist as a registered class insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its statutory financial return in respect of its losses and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
michael e 
angelina  chief actuary and risk officer for the company  has been appointed by our board of directors and has been approved by the bma to act as endurance bermuda s loss reserve specialist 
statutory financial statements an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  an income statement  a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with us gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act  which financial statements  in the case of the company  will be prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as a general business insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by bma 
annual statutory financial return endurance bermuda is required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end unless specifically extended upon application to the bma 
the statutory financial return for a class insurer includes  among other matters  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  solvency certificates  the statutory financial statements  the opinion of the loss reserve specialist and a schedule of reinsurance ceded 
the solvency certificates must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer certifying that the minimum solvency margin has been met and whether the insurer complied with the conditions attached to its certificate of registration 
the independent auditor is required to state whether  in its opinion  it was reasonable for the directors to make these certifications 
if an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions under the insurance act  the value of the general business assets of a class insurer  such as endurance bermuda  must exceed the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin

although endurance bermuda is incorporated in bermuda  it is classified as a non resident of bermuda for exchange control purposes by the bma 
pursuant to its non resident status  endurance bermuda may engage in transactions in currencies other than bermuda dollars and there are no restrictions on its ability to transfer funds other than funds denominated in bermuda dollars in and out of bermuda or to pay dividends to united states residents who are holders of its ordinary shares 
under bermuda law  exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside bermuda from a principal place of business in bermuda 
as exempted companies  endurance holdings and endurance bermuda may not  without the express authorization of the bermuda legislature or under a license or consent granted by the minister  participate in certain business transactions  including the acquisition or holding of land in bermuda except that held by way of lease or tenancy agreement which is required for its business and held for a term not exceeding years  or which is used to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for its officers and employees and held with the consent of the minister  for a term not exceeding years  the taking of mortgages on land in bermuda to secure an amount in excess of  to acquire any bonds or debentures secured on any land in bermuda except bonds or debentures issued by the government of bermuda or a public authority or the carrying on of business of any kind for which it is not licensed in bermuda  except in certain limited circumstances such as doing business with another exempted undertaking in furtherance of endurance holdings business or endurance bermuda s business as the case may be carried on outside bermuda

uk regulation general on december   the fsa assumed its full powers and responsibilities as the single statutory regulator responsible for regulating the financial services industry in respect of the carrying on of regulated activities including deposit taking  insurance  investment management and most other financial services business by way of business in the uk  with the purpose of maintaining confidence in the uk financial system  providing public understanding of the system  securing the proper degree of protection for consumers and helping to reduce financial crime 
it is a criminal offense for any person to carry on a regulated activity in the uk unless that person is authorized by the fsa and has been granted permission to carry on that regulated activity or falls under an exemption 
insurance business which includes reinsurance business is authorized and supervised by the fsa 
insurance business in the united kingdom is divided between two main categories long term insurance which is primarily investment related and general insurance 
it is not possible for an insurance company to be authorized in both long term and general insurance business 
these two categories are both divided into classes for example permanent health and pension fund management are two classes of long term insurance  damage to property and motor vehicle liability are two classes of general insurance 
under the financial services and markets act  effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance  within a class of general or long term insurance  by way of business in the united kingdom  constitutes a regulated activity requiring individual authorization 
an authorized insurance company must have permission for each class of insurance business it intends to write 
endurance uk has received authorization from the fsa to effect and carry out in the united kingdom contracts of insurance in all classes of general business limited in the case of credit and surety to reinsurance only except legal expenses and assistance business 
on january   as a result of the implementation by the united kingdom government of the insurance mediation directive ec various additional activities  which had previously been unregulated  fell within the scope of fsa regulation 
endurance uk has accordingly received authorization from the fsa to conduct the following additional regulated activities arranging bringing about deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments 
in both cases  those activities are restricted to non investment insurance contracts 
as an authorized insurer in the united kingdom  endurance uk would be able to operate throughout the eu  subject to certain regulatory requirements of the fsa and in some cases  certain local regulatory requirements 
an insurance company with fsa authorization to write insurance business in the united kingdom can seek consent from the fsa to allow it to provide cross border services in other member states of the eu as an alternative  fsa consent may be obtained to establish a branch office within another member state 
as an fsa authorized insurer  the insurance and reinsurance businesses of endurance uk are subject to close supervision by the fsa 
the fsa has implemented specific requirements for senior management arrangements  systems and controls of insurance and reinsurance companies under its jurisdiction  which place a strong emphasis on risk identification and management in relation to the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance business in the united kingdom 
in december   the fsa prompted a market initiative in the united kingdom insurance industry to resolve perceived problems resulting from contract uncertainty  which may exist where the full terms and conditions of a contract of insurance or reinsurance are not established at or before the time when the contract comes into force 
the fsa s stated preferred outcome was that a market solution should be produced which met the regulator s main concerns  which were that policyholders should know precisely what protection they have bought  and that insurers  reinsurers and brokers should have a clearer view  at the time of inception of a contract of the relevant legal  fiduciary  operational and underwriting risks to which they are subject 
on january   the fsa announced that the insurance industry had met the challenge laid down by the regulator to achieve a solution to contract certainty in the united kingdom 
accordingly  the fsa does not  at present  intend to propose new rules to address the problem 
however  the fsa also stated that contract certainty would continue to be a supervisory priority in and that  in those cases where it believes that firms have fallen behind the rest of the market in reducing the number of contracts that do not meet the market s contract certainty standards  it would consider regulatory action to address this 
this action might include increases in required regulatory capital or the commencement of enforcement action 
supervision the fsa carries out the prudential supervision of insurance companies through a variety of methods  including the collection of information from statistical returns  review of accountants reports  visits to insurance companies and regular formal interviews 
the fsa has adopted a risk based approach to the supervision of insurance companies 
under this approach the fsa performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the uk periodically  which varies in length according to the risk profile of the insurer 
the fsa performs the risk assessment by analyzing information which it receives during the normal course of its supervision  such as regular prudential returns on the financial position of the insurance company  or which it acquires through a series of meetings with senior management of the insurance company 
after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile 
this will include details of any remedial action that the fsa requires and the likely consequences if this action is not taken 
solvency requirements the fsa s general prudential sourcebook and prudential sourcebook for insurers together  the prudential sourcebooks require that insurance companies maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of any general insurance undertaken by the insurance company  the calculation of which in any particular case depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes 
the method of calculation of the solvency margin is set out in the prudential sourcebooks  and for these purposes  all insurer s assets and liabilities are subject to specific valuation rules which are set out in the prudential sourcebooks 
failure to maintain the required solvency margin is one of the grounds on which wide powers of intervention conferred upon the fsa may be exercised 
for financial years ending on or after january   the calculation of the required margin of solvency has been amended as a result of the implementation of the eu solvency i directives 
in respect of liability business accepted  of the actual premiums written and claims incurred must be included in the calculation  which has had the effect of increasing the required minimum margin of solvency of endurance uk 
endurance uk continuously monitors its solvency capital position and maintains capital in excess of the required minimum margin of solvency 
each insurance company writing various classes of business is also required by the prudential sourcebooks to maintain equalization provisions calculated in accordance with the provisions of the prudential sourcebook for insurers 
insurers are required to calculate an enhanced capital requirement ecr in addition to their required minimum solvency margin and to report it to the fsa though the ecr is not part of the formal capital requirements under the prudential sourcebooks 
this represents a more risk based calculation than the statutory solvency margin requirements derived from the eu directives 
there is also a requirement for insurers to maintain financial resources which are adequate  both as to amount and quality  to ensure that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they come due 
in order to carry out the assessment as to the necessary financial resources that are required  an insurer is required to identify the major sources of risk to its ability to meet its liabilities as they come due  and to carry out stress and scenario tests to identify an appropriate range of realistic adverse scenarios in which the risk crystallizes and to estimate the financial resources needed in each of the circumstances and events identified 
in addition  the fsa gives individual capital guidance icg regularly to insurers and reinsurers following receipt of individual capital assessments  prepared by firms themselves 
the fsa s guidance may be that a company should hold more or less than its then current level of regulatory capital  or that the company s regulatory capital should remain unaltered 
endurance uk has submitted an individual capital assessment solvency calculation to the fsa and has agreed with the fsa the bases and methodology for this calculation 
this calculation is used along with other tools by the fsa to help establish the icg 
endurance uk is currently calculating the ecr for december  should endurance uk not meet this test  additional capital may be required 
in addition  an insurer other than a pure reinsurer that is part of a group  is required to perform and submit to the fsa a solvency margin calculation return in respect of its ultimate parent undertaking  in accordance with the fsa s rules 
this return is not part of an insurer s own solvency return and hence will not be publicly available 
although there is no requirement for the parent undertaking solvency calculation to show a positive result  the fsa may take action where it considers that the solvency of the insurance company is or may be jeopardized due to the group solvency position 
further  an insurer is required to report in its annual returns to the fsa all material related party transactions eg  intra group reinsurance  whose value is more than of the insurer s general insurance business amount 
restrictions on dividend payments uk company law prohibits endurance uk from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
while the united kingdom insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer s ability to declare a dividend  the fsa strictly controls the maintenance of each insurance company s solvency margin within its jurisdiction 
the fsa s rules require endurance uk to notify the fsa of any proposed or actual payment of a dividend 
any such payment or proposal could result in regulatory intervention 
in addition  the fsa requires authorized insurance companies to notify the fsa in advance of any significant dividend payment 
reporting requirements uk insurance companies must prepare their financial statements under the companies act of as amended  which requires the filing with companies house of audited financial statements and related reports 
in addition  uk insurance companies are required to file with the fsa regulatory returns  which include a revenue account  a profit and loss account and a balance sheet in prescribed forms 
under the interim prudential sourcebook for insurers  audited regulatory returns must be filed with the fsa within two months and days or three months where the delivery of the return is made electronically 
supervision of management the fsa closely supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified controlled functions within a regulated entity  must be approved by the fsa 
change of control fsma regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company authorized under fsma 
any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of the ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of endurance uk under fsma  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must give prior notification to the fsa of his intention to do so 
the fsa would then have three months to consider that person s application to acquire control 
in considering whether to approve such application  the fsa must be satisfied that both the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against the company by the fsa 
intervention and enforcement the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an authorized person  culminating in the ultimate sanction of the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity 
fsma imposes on the fsa statutory obligations to monitor compliance with the requirements imposed by fsma  and to enforce the provisions of fsma related rules made by the fsa 
the fsa has power  among other things  to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of both the prudential sourcebooks and breaches of the conduct of business rules generally applicable to authorized persons 
the fsa also has the power to prosecute criminal offences arising under fsma  and to prosecute insider dealing under part v of the criminal justice act of  and breaches of money laundering regulations 
the fsa s stated policy is to pursue criminal prosecution in all appropriate cases 
passporting european union directives allow endurance uk to conduct business in european union states other than the united kingdom in compliance with the scope of permission granted these companies by the fsa without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in other european union jurisdictions 
this ability to operate in other jurisdictions of the european union on the basis of home state authorization and supervision is sometimes referred to as passporting 
insurers may operate outside their home member state either on a services basis or on an establishment basis 
operating on a services basis means that the company conducts permitted businesses in the host state without having a physical presence there  while operating on an establishment basis means the company has a branch or physical presence in the host state 
in both cases  a company remains subject to regulation by its home regulator  and not by local regulatory authorities  although the company nonetheless may have to comply with certain local rules 
in addition to european union member states  norway  iceland and liechtenstein members of the broader european economic area are jurisdictions in which this passporting framework applies 
us regulation endurance us reinsurance was organized under the laws of new york on september  on december   endurance us reinsurance received a license to write certain lines of insurance and reinsurance business from the new york state insurance department 
on august   endurance us reinsurance acquired endurance american specialty insurance company  a delaware insurance company  which transacts business on a surplus lines basis 
on june   endurance us reinsurance acquired endurance american insurance company  a delaware insurance company  which transacts business on an admitted basis 
new york insurance holding company regulation of endurance holdings endurance holdings  as the indirect parent of endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance  and endurance us holdings corp  as the direct parent of endurance us reinsurance  are subject to the insurance holding company laws of new york and delaware  the states in which endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance are organized and domiciled  respectively 
these laws generally require  among other things  the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system 
generally  all material transactions among companies in the holding company system involving endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance  including sales  loans  reinsurance agreements  service agreements and dividend payments  must be fair and  if material or of a specified category  require prior notice and approval or non disapproval by the new york superintendent of insurance the new york superintendent and the delaware commissioner of insurance the delaware commissioner  respectively 
changes of control before a person can acquire control of a us domestic insurer or reinsurer  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the insurer or reinsurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer or reinsurer  the domiciliary state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the proposed acquiror  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
generally  state insurance statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring ten percent or more of endurance holdings ordinary shares would indirectly acquire the same percentage of common stock of both endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such a transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of endurance holdings  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the shareholders of endurance holdings might consider to be desirable state insurance regulation of endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are generally not subject to regulation by any us state insurance department with respect to rates or policy terms unlike primary insurance agreements  the rates and policy terms of which are generally closely regulated by state insurance departments 
as a practical matter  however  the rates charged by primary insurers do have an effect on the rates that can be charged by reinsurers 
state insurance authorities have broad regulatory powers with respect to various aspects of the business of both endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance including licensing to transact business  admittance of assets to statutory surplus  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards  and regulating investments and dividends 
with respect to direct insurance business  states may also regulate rates and forms used by insurers admitted to transact business within a given state jurisdiction 
state insurance laws and regulations require endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance to file financial statements with insurance departments everywhere it is licensed  authorized or accredited to conduct insurance business  and the operations of endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance are subject to examination by those departments at any time 
endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records  financial reporting  policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled or authorized to transact business in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
state dividend limitations under the new york and delaware insurance law  endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance  respectively  may only pay dividends to their respective parent companies out of earned surplus 
under the new york insurance law  earned surplus is defined as the portion of the insurer s surplus that represents net earnings  gains or profits  after deduction of all losses  that have not been distributed to shareholders as dividends or transferred to stated capital or capital surplus or applied to other purposes permitted by law  but does not include unrealized appreciation of assets 
in delaware  earned surplus is defined as an amount equal to the unassigned funds of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer submitted to the delaware commissioner  including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in addition  the ability of endurance us reinsurance to declare or pay any dividend to its direct parent company  endurance us holdings corp  which  together with all dividends declared or distributed by it during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the lesser of

the net income  not including realized capital gains for the month period ending the st day of december next preceding will be subject to the prior approval of the delaware commissioner 
any dividend paid by endurance us insurance must first be paid to its immediate parent  endurance us reinsurance  which is subject to the restrictions of the new york insurance law  as set forth above 
the dividend limitations imposed by the new york and delaware insurance law is based on the statutory financial results of endurance us reinsurance and endurance us insurance determined by using statutory accounting practices which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred acquisition expenses  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
at december   and  neither endurance us reinsurance nor endurance us insurance had earned surplus  and therefore  both entities will be precluded from declaring or distributing any dividend until each entity has earned surplus 
new york and delaware state risk based capital regulations the new york and delaware insurance laws require that insurers report their risk based capital rbc based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the state insurance departments use the formula only as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
insurance laws impose broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in the insurance business including insurers  agents  brokers and others and on the state insurance departments as to the use and publication of rbc data 
the new york superintendent and delaware commissioner have explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain rbc levels 
statutory accounting practices statutory accounting practices  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist us insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
it is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
us gaap concerns an insurer s solvency  but it also concerns other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  us gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap as opposed to sap 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted  in part  by the new york and delaware departments of insurance  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of endurance holdings us insurance company subsidiaries and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to their respective parent companies 
operations of endurance uk and endurance bermuda endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not admitted to do business in any state in the united states 
insurance laws of each state of the united states and of many other countries restrict or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non admitted alien insurers and reinsurers such as endurance uk and endurance bermuda 
in addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states of the united states governing credit for reinsurance which are imposed on their ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the reinsurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of written premiums which applies to the remaining portion of the policy period and loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
as stated above  endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement 
a few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non licensed or non accredited reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited 
we do not believe that endurance uk and endurance bermuda are in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction in the united states 
there can be no assurance however  that inquiries or challenges to endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities will not be raised in the future 
material tax considerations certain bermuda tax considerations currently  there is no bermuda income  corporation or profits tax  withholding tax  capital gains tax  capital transfer tax  estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or our shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
currently  there is no bermuda withholding or other tax on principal interest or dividends paid to holders of the ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  other than holders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
there can be no assurance that we or our shareholders will not be subject to any such tax in the future 
endurance bermuda has received written assurance dated december  and endurance holdings has received written assurance dated july  from the minister under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  that if there is enacted in bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to endurance bermuda or endurance holdings or to any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or obligations until march   provided  that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in bermuda  or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by endurance bermuda or endurance holdings in respect of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda held by them 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to any such tax after march  certain united kingdom tax considerations endurance uk is a company incorporated in the united kingdom and is  therefore  resident in the united kingdom for united kingdom corporation tax purposes and will be subject to united kingdom corporation tax on its worldwide profits 
the current rate of united kingdom corporation tax is generally on profits of whatever description 
currently  no united kingdom withholding tax applies to dividends paid by endurance uk certain united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations relating to endurance holdings  endurance bermuda  endurance uk  endurance uk reinsurance  endurance uk insurance and the ownership of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
this summary is based upon the code  the regulations promulgated thereunder  rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the irs  judicial decisions  the tax treaty between the united states and bermuda the bermuda treaty and the tax treaty between the united states and the united kingdom the uk treaty  all as currently in effect  and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
no assurance can be given that the irs would assert  or that a court would not sustain  a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below 
no advance ruling has been or will be sought from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this annual report on form k 
this summary is for general information only  and does not purport to discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of such investor s investment or tax circumstances  or to investors subject to special tax rules  such as tax exempt organizations  dealers in securities  banks  insurance companies  persons that hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest rate or insurance risks or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction  or persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
this summary assumes that an investor will hold our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares as capital assets  which generally means as property held for investment 
investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences  in their particular circumstances  of the ownership of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares under us federal  state  local and other tax laws 
for us federal income tax purposes and for purposes of the following discussion  a us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a corporation  or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  or a partnership  or other entity treated as a partnership for u 
s federal income tax purposes  in each case created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any of its political subdivisions  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax without regard to its source or iv a trust if either a a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes 
a us person is a nonresident alien individual  or a corporation  estate or trust that is not a us person 
if a partnership owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership 
if you are a partner of a partnership that owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  you should consult your tax advisor 
united states taxation of endurance holdings  endurance bermuda  endurance uk  endurance uk reinsurance and endurance uk insurance we intend to continue to operate endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk in such a manner that they will not be considered to be conducting business within the united states for purposes of us federal income taxation 
whether business is being conducted in the united states is an inherently factual determination 
because the code  regulations and court decisions fail to identify definitively activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states  there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend successfully that endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are or will be engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
a foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to us federal income tax at a current maximum rate of  as well as a branch profits tax in certain circumstances  on its income which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provision of an applicable tax treaty  as discussed below 
such income tax  if imposed  would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a us corporation  except that a foreign corporation is entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a us federal income tax return 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk intend to file protective us federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that they are subject to us federal income tax 
if endurance bermuda is entitled to the benefits under the bermuda treaty  it will not be subject to us federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
whether business is being conducted in the united states through a permanent establishment is an inherently factual determination 
endurance bermuda intends to conduct its activities so as not to have a permanent establishment in the united states  although there can be no assurance that it will achieve this result 
an insurance enterprise resident in bermuda generally will be entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty if i more than of its shares are owned beneficially  directly or indirectly  by individual residents of the united states or bermuda or us citizens and ii its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to make disproportionate distributions to  or to meet certain liabilities of  persons who are neither residents of either the united states or bermuda nor us citizens 
foreign insurance companies that conduct an insurance business within the united states must maintain a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income  determined in accordance with a formula that depends  in part  on the amount of us risk insured or reinsured by such companies 
if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and it is not entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty  either because it fails to satisfy one of the limitations on bermuda treaty benefits described above or because endurance bermuda is considered to have a us permanent establishment  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s premium and investment income could be subject to us federal income tax 
in addition  while the bermuda treaty clearly applies to premium income  it is not clear whether it applies to other income  such as investment income 
if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and is entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty  but the bermuda treaty is interpreted so as not to apply to investment income  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s investment income could be subject to us federal income tax even if endurance bermuda does not maintain a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the uk treaty  endurance uk  if entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  will not be subject to uk federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
endurance uk intends to conduct its activities in a manner so that it does not have a permanent establishment in the united states  although we cannot predict whether we will achieve this result 
endurance uk will be entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty if i during at least half of the days during the relevant taxable period  at least of endurance uk s stock is beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by citizens or residents of the united states and the united kingdom  and less than of endurance uk s gross income for the relevant taxable period is paid or accrued  directly or indirectly  to persons who are not us or uk residents in the form of payments that are deductible for purposes of uk taxation or ii with respect to specific items of income  profit or gain derived from the united states  if such income  profit or gain is considered to be derived in connection with  or incidental to  endurance uk s business conducted in the united kingdom 
foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the united states are nonetheless subject to us withholding tax at a rate of of the gross amount of certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains  profits and income derived from sources within the united states such as dividends and certain interest on investments  subject to reduction by applicable treaties 
the united states also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the united states 
the rate of tax applicable to premiums paid to endurance bermuda is for casualty insurance premiums and for reinsurance premiums 
the excise tax will not apply to premiums paid to endurance uk if endurance uk is entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  and certain other requirements are met 
endurance us reinsurance is a new york state corporation and endurance us insurance is a delaware company 
each will be subject to taxation in the united states at regular corporate rates 
dividends paid by endurance us holdings corp 
to endurance bermuda will be subject to us withholding tax at the rate of 
united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons dividends 
distributions with respect to ordinary shares and series a preferred shares including the payment of additional amounts  in the case of the series a preferred shares will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent of endurance holdings current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes  subject to the discussion below relating to the potential application of the controlled foreign corporation  related person insurance income and passive foreign investment company rules 
these dividends should constitute qualified dividend income as defined in section h b of the code and  thus  should be entitled to the preferential federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received before january  by certain shareholders such as individuals  provided that we are not considered a pfic or a foreign investment company 
distributions with respect to endurance holdings ordinary shares and series a preferred shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to us corporations under the code 
the amount of any distribution in excess of the current and accumulated earnings and profits of endurance holdings will first be applied to reduce a holder s tax basis in the ordinary shares or series a preferred shares as the case may be  and any amount in excess of tax basis will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such holder s shares 
classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
each us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and who owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through foreign entities  in such corporation on the last day  in such year  in which such corporation is a cfc must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
a foreign corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of such foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of such corporation 
a us shareholder is a us person who owns at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation 
the series a preferred shares should not be considered voting stock for purposes of determining whether a us person would be a us shareholder unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the series a preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the series a preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a foreign corporation in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules by us shareholders  on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance contracts exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
due to the anticipated dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of any shares that are entitled to vote and authorize the board to repurchase such shares under certain circumstances and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge the effectiveness of these provisions for purposes of preventing us shareholder status and that a court will not sustain such challenge 
rpii companies 
the cfc rules also apply to certain insurance companies that earn related person insurance income 
for purposes of applying the cfc rules to foreign corporations that earn rpii  a different definition of controlled foreign corporation  as discussed below  applies 
rpii is defined as any insurance income attributable to policies of insurance or reinsurance with respect to which the person directly or indirectly insured is a rpii shareholder of the foreign corporation or a related person to such rpii shareholder 
in general  and subject to certain limitations  insurance income is income including premium and investment income attributable to the issuing of any insurance or reinsurance contract which would be taxed under the portions of the code relating to insurance companies if the income were the income of a domestic insurance company 
for purposes of the rpii rules  related person means someone who controls or is controlled by the rpii shareholder or someone who is controlled by the same person or persons which control the rpii shareholder 
control is measured by either more than in value or more than in voting power of stock  applying constructive ownership principles 
a corporation s pension plan is ordinarily not a related person with respect to the corporation unless the pension plan owns  directly or indirectly through the application of constructive ownership rules  more than  measured by vote or value  of the stock of the corporation 
for purposes of inclusion of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii in the income of a rpii shareholder  to the extent required under the rpii rules  the term rpii shareholder means any us person who owns  directly or indirectly through foreign entities  any amount rather than stock possessing or more of the total combined voting power of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s stock 
endurance uk or endurance bermuda will be treated as a cfc for rpii purposes if such persons collectively own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or by application of the constructive ownership rules or more of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda by vote or value 
rpii exceptions 
the special rpii rules do not apply if i direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds  whether or not us persons  own  directly or indirectly  less than of the voting power and less than of the value of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable the ownership exception  ii rpii  determined on a gross basis  is less than of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income for the taxable year  as applicable the gross income exception  iii endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be taxed on its rpii as if the rpii were effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business and to waive all treaty benefits with respect to rpii and meets certain other requirements or iv endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be treated as a us corporation 
endurance bermuda and endurance uk intend to operate in a manner that is intended to ensure that each qualifies for the gross income exception 
it is possible that neither endurance bermuda nor endurance uk will be successful in qualifying under this exception 
if none of these exceptions applies  each us person who owns shares in endurance holdings and therefore  indirectly in endurance uk and endurance bermuda on the last day of endurance holdings taxable year  will be required to include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its share of rpii of endurance uk and or endurance bermuda for the entire taxable year 
this inclusion will be determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to such us persons holding shares in endurance holdings at that date 
the inclusion will be limited to the current year earnings and profits of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable  reduced by the shareholder s pro rata share  if any  of certain prior year deficits in earnings and profits 
computation of rpii 
in order to determine how much rpii each of endurance uk and endurance bermuda has earned in each taxable year  endurance holdings intends to obtain and rely upon information from endurance uk s and endurance bermuda s insureds and reinsureds to determine whether any of the insureds  reinsureds or other persons related to such insureds or reinsureds own shares in endurance holdings and are us persons 
endurance holdings may not be able to determine whether any of the underlying insureds of the insurance companies to which endurance uk and endurance bermuda provide insurance or reinsurance are us shareholders or related persons to such shareholders 
consequently  endurance holdings may not be able to determine accurately the gross amount of rpii earned by endurance uk or endurance bermuda in a given taxable year 
for any taxable year in which endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross rpii is or more of its gross insurance income for the year  endurance holdings may also seek information from its shareholders to determine whether direct or indirect owners of shares in endurance holdings at the end of the year are us persons so that the rpii may be determined and apportioned among such persons 
to the extent endurance holdings is unable to determine whether a direct or indirect owner of shares is a us person  endurance holdings may assume that such owner is not a us person  thereby increasing the per share rpii amount for all shareholders identified as us persons 
basis adjustments 
a rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  as the case may be  will be increased by the amount of any rpii that the shareholder includes in income 
any distributions made by endurance holdings out of previously taxed rpii income will be exempt from further tax in the hands of the rpii shareholder 
the rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings shares will be reduced by the amount of any distributions that are excluded from income under this rule 
information reporting 
under certain circumstances  us persons owning stock in a foreign corporation are required to file irs form with their us federal income tax returns 
generally  information reporting on irs form is required with respect to i a person who is treated as a rpii shareholder  ii a us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any tax year of the foreign corporation  and who owned the stock on the last of that year and iii under certain circumstances  a us person who acquires stock in a foreign corporation  and as a result thereof owns or more of the voting power or value of such foreign corporation  whether or not such foreign corporation is a cfc 
for any taxable year in which endurance holdings determines that gross rpii constitutes or more of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income and the ownership exception does not apply  endurance holdings intends to mail to all us persons registered as holders of its ordinary shares and series a preferred shares irs form  completed with information from endurance holdings  for attachment to the us federal income tax returns of such shareholders 
a tax exempt organization that is treated as a us shareholder or a rpii shareholder also must file irs form in the circumstances described above 
failure to file irs form may result in penalties 
tax exempt shareholders 
tax exempt entities will be required to treat certain subpart f insurance income  including rpii  that is includible in income by the tax exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income 
dispositions of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
subject to the discussion below relating to the redemption of series a preferred shares or the potential application of code section or the pfic rules  any gain or loss realized by a us person on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will be subject to us federal income taxation as capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon such sale or exchange and such person s tax basis in the shares 
if the holding period for these shares exceeds one year at the time of the disposition  any gain will be subject to tax at a current maximum marginal tax rate of for individuals and for corporations 
moreover  gain  if any  generally will be us source gain and generally will constitute passive income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes 
code section provides that if a us person sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation and such person owned directly  indirectly through certain foreign entities or constructively or more of the voting power of the corporation at any time during the five year period ending on the date of disposition when the corporation was a cfc  any gain from the sale or exchange of the shares will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the cfc s earnings and profits determined under us federal income tax principles during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the corporation was a cfc with certain adjustments 
a us shareholder may in certain circumstances be required to report a disposition of shares of a cfc by attaching irs form to the us federal income tax or information return that it would normally file for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs 
for these purposes  the series a preferred shares should not be considered as having voting power unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the series a preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the series a preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
section also applies to the sale or exchange of shares in a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation would be treated as a cfc for rpii purposes and would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation  regardless of whether the shareholder is a us shareholder or whether the gross income exception or the ownership exception applies 
proposed regulations do not specifically address whether or how code section would apply to dispositions of shares of stock in a foreign corporation that is not a cfc and does not directly engage in the insurance business  but has a subsidiary that is a cfc and that would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation 
the company believes  however  that the application of code section under the rpii rules should not apply to the disposition of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares because endurance holdings is not directly engaged in the insurance business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not interpret the regulations in a contrary manner or that the us treasury department will not amend the regulations to provide that these rules will apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effects of these rules on a disposition of our shares 
uncertainty as to application of rpii 
regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes might ultimately be made or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and their application to endurance uk and endurance bermuda is uncertain 
these provisions include the grant of authority to the us treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection  including regulations preventing the avoidance of this subsection through cross insurance arrangements or otherwise 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge any determinations by endurance uk or endurance bermuda as to the amount  if any  of rpii that should be includible in income or that the amounts of the rpii inclusions will not be subject to adjustment based upon subsequent irs examination 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the effects of these uncertainties 
redemption of series a preferred shares 
subject to the discussion herein relating to the application of the rpii and pfic rules  under section of the code  a redemption of the series a preferred shares will be treated as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  unless such redemption satisfies the tests set forth under section b of the code  which would treat the redemption as a sale or exchange subject to taxation as described above under dispositions of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
a redemption will be treated as a sale or exchange if i it is substantially disproportionate  ii constitutes a complete termination of the holder s stock interest in us  or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend  each within the meaning of section b of the code 
in determining whether any of these tests are satisfied  shares considered to be owned by a us person by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code  as well as shares actually owned  must generally be taken into account 
because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section b of the code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the series a preferred shares will depend on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made  us shareholders should consult their tax advisors  at such time  to determine their tax treatment in light of their particular circumstances 
passive foreign investment companies 
in general  a foreign corporation will be a pfic during a given year if i or more of its gross income constitutes passive income or ii or more of its assets produce passive income 
if endurance holdings were characterized as a pfic during a given year  us persons owning ordinary shares or series a preferred shares would be subject to a penalty tax at the time of the sale at a gain of  or receipt of an excess distribution with respect to  their shares  unless such shareholders made a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election 
it is uncertain that endurance holdings would be able to provide its shareholders with the information necessary for a us person to make the elections 
in general  a shareholder receives an excess distribution if the amount of the distribution is more than of the average distribution with respect to the shares during the three preceding taxable years or shorter period during which the taxpayer held the shares 
in general  the penalty tax is equivalent to an interest charge on taxes that are deemed due during the period the shareholder owned the shares  computed by assuming that the excess distribution or gain in the case of a sale with respect to the shares was taxed in equal portions at the highest applicable tax rate on ordinary income throughout the shareholder s period of ownership 
the interest charge is equal to the applicable rate imposed on underpayments of us federal income tax for such period 
for the above purposes  passive income generally includes interest  dividends  annuities and other investment income 
the pfic statutory provisions  however  contain an express exception for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception is intended to ensure that income derived by a bona fide insurance company is not treated as passive income  except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
endurance holdings expects for purposes of the pfic rules that each of endurance uk and endurance bermuda will be predominantly engaged in an insurance business and is unlikely to have financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of its insurance business 
accordingly  neither expects to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurances  however  that this will be the case 
the pfic statutory provisions contain a look through rule stating that  for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic  such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the income 


and as if it held its proportionate share of the assets 


of any other corporation in which it owns at least by value of the shares 
while no explicit guidance is provided by the statutory language  under this look through rule endurance holdings should be deemed to own the assets and to have received the income of its insurance subsidiaries directly for purposes of determining whether it qualifies for the insurance exception 
consequently  endurance holdings does not expect to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
this interpretation of the look through rule is consistent with the legislative intention generally to exclude bona fide insurance companies from the application of pfic provision 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisor as to the effects of the pfic rules 
other 
except as discussed below with respect to backup withholding  dividends paid by endurance holdings will not be subject to us withholding tax 
information reporting and backup withholding 
information returns may be filed with the irs in connection with payments of dividends with respect to our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the shares unless the shareholder establishes an exemption from the information reporting rules 
a us person holding our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares that does not establish such an exemption may be subject to us backup withholding tax on these payments if the holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules 
the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a us person will be allowed as a credit against the us person s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund  provided that the required information is furnished to the irs 
shareholders who are non us persons dividends and disposition 
in general and subject to the discussion below under information reporting and backup withholding  a non us person will not be subject to non us federal income or withholding tax with respect to payments of dividends on  or gain upon the disposition of  our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares unless i the dividends or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non us person of a trade or business in the united states or ii in the case of gain upon the disposition of shares  the non us person is an individual who is present in the united states for days or more in the taxable year and certain other conditions are met 
nonresident alien individuals will not be subject to us estate tax with respect to our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares 
dividends or gain that is effectively connected with the conduct by a non us person of a trade or business in the united states generally will be subject to regular us federal income tax in the same manner as if it were realized by a us person 
in addition  if such non us 
person is a non us 
corporation  such dividends or gain may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of or such lower rate as is provided by an applicable income tax treaty 
information reporting and backup withholding 
if our ordinary shares or series a preferred shares are held by a non us person through a non us and non us related broker or financial institution  information reporting and backup withholding generally would not be required 
information reporting  and possibly backup withholding  may apply if the shares are held by a non us person through a us or us related broker or financial institution and the non us person fails to provide appropriate information 
non us persons should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules 
proposed us tax legislation 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
while there are no currently pending legislative proposals which  if enacted  would have a material adverse effect on us or our shareholders  it is possible that broader based legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders

number of holders of ordinary shares the approximate number of record holders of our ordinary shares as of february  was  not including beneficial owners of shares registered in nominee or street name 
dividend history and restrictions we paid a quarterly dividend of per ordinary share in each of the four quarters of and our board of directors reviews our ordinary share dividend each quarter 
among the factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of each dividend are the results of operations and the capital requirements  growth and other characteristics of our businesses 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is also subject to certain legal  regulatory and other restrictions 
endurance holdings is a holding company and has no direct operations 
the ability of endurance holdings to pay dividends or distributions depends almost exclusively on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to endurance holdings 
under bermuda law  endurance bermuda may not declare or pay a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that endurance bermuda is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or the realizable value of endurance bermuda s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
further  endurance bermuda  as a regulated insurance company in bermuda  is subject to additional regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions 
as of december   the maximum amount of distributions that endurance bermuda could pay to endurance holdings under applicable insurance and companies act regulations without prior regulatory approval was approximately million 
at december   endurance us reinsurance  endurance us insurance and endurance us were precluded by regulatory restrictions from declaring or distributing dividends 
our credit facilities prohibit endurance holdings from declaring or paying any dividends if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such declaration or payment or would result from such declaration or payment 
in addition  the terms of our series a preferred shares prohibit dividends from being declared or paid on ordinary shares unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding series a preferred shares have been declared and paid
