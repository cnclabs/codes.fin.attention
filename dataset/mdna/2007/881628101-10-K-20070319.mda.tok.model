item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition of operations cash flows and expenditures 
we may in the future enter into these and other types of hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of oil and natural gas 
hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including if production is less than expected  the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
hedging transactions may limit the benefit we otherwise would have received from increases in the price for oil and natural gas 
furthermore  if we do not engage in hedging transactions  then we may be more adversely affected by declines in oil and natural gas prices than our competitors that engage in hedging transactions 
additionally  hedging transactions may expose us to cash margin requirements 
the marketability of our production depends mostly upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities  which are owned by third parties 
the marketability of our production depends upon the availability  operation  and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities  which are owned by third parties 
the unavailability or lack of capacity of these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
we currently own an interest in several wells that are capable of producing but may be curtailed from time to time at some point in the future pending gas sales contract negotiations  as well as construction of gas gathering systems  pipelines  and processing facilities 
united states federal  state  and foreign regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  damage to or destruction of pipelines  general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
if market factors change dramatically  the financial impact on us could be substantial 
the availability of markets and the volatility of product prices are beyond our control and represent a significant risk 

table of contents our credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit  which could adversely affect our operations 
our revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount  determined by our lenders in their sole discretion  based upon  among other things  our level of proven reserves and the projected revenues from the oil and natural gas properties securing our loan 
the lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all of the lenders 
if the lenders do not agree on an increase  then the borrowing base will be the lowest borrowing base acceptable to the required number of lenders 
outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately  or we must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral 
upon a downward adjustment of the borrowing base  if borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing base are outstanding  we could be forced to repay our indebtedness under the revolving credit facility if we do not have any substantial unpledged properties to pledge as additional collateral 
we may not have sufficient funds to make repayments under our revolving credit facility 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  or will be able to refinance such debt through equity financings or by selling assets 
the terms of our revolving credit facility also may prohibit us from taking such actions 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock  a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering  refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed 
our debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
our level of indebtedness  and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt  could have important consequences for our operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and detracting from our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other activities  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors  and making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  because borrowings under our credit facility may be at rates prevailing at the time of each borrowing 

table of contents the instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business 
our revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants that limit our management s discretion in operating our business 
in particular  these agreements will limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt  if any  make loans to others  make investments  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  create certain liens  sell assets  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries to us  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into hedging contracts  create unrestricted subsidiaries  and enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
in addition  our revolving credit facility also requires us to maintain a certain working capital ratio and a certain debt to ebitdax as defined in the revolving credit facility as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and exploration expense ratio 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions in the revolving credit facility or any other subsequent financing agreements  a default may allow the creditors if the agreements so provide to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make available further funds 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas and oil reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
to date  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with equity financings as well as from cash generated from the sale of our russian operations 
we anticipate being able to finance our future capital expenditures with a combination of cash flow from operations  our existing financing arrangements  and equity financings 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 

table of contents if our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  then we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
we may  from time to time  need to seek additional financing 
we cannot assure you of the availability or terms of any additional financing 
if additional capital is needed  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if cash generated by operations or available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in our financial statements 
in order to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
we also must analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
therefore  estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves in our financial statements 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those presented using the present value estimate 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can adversely affect the conduct of drilling activities on our properties 
oil and natural gas operations can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife  particularly in the rocky mountain region where we currently operate 
in certain areas  drilling and other oil and natural gas activities can only be conducted during the spring and summer months 
this may limit operations in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs  oil field equipment  services  supplies and qualified 
table of contents personnel  which may lead to periodic shortages 
resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our level of reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our cash flows and income 
unless we conduct successful development  exploitation  and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and  therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  exploit  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we currently have four employees that serve in senior management roles 
in particular  our chief executive officer  karl f 
arleth  our chief operating officer  dominic j 
bazile ii  and our vice president of production  andrew n 
schultz  are responsible for the operation of our oil and gas business and bill i 
pennington  our executive vice president  treasurer  and chief financial officer  oversees our finance and administrative organizations 
the loss of any one of these employees could severely harm our business 
although we have a life insurance policy on mr 
arleth  of which we are a beneficiary  we do not currently maintain key man insurance on the lives of any of the other three individuals 
furthermore  competition for experienced personnel is intense 
if we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel  our ability to compete could be adversely affected 
rising inflation and price increases could have a negative effect on our value and increase our costs 
we may experience increased costs during and due to increased demand for oil and gas field products and services 
the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry can place extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
historically in the oil and gas industry  material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs materially to increase  continued high prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
our inability to meet operating and financial obligations could adversely affect our business 
we have obligations and commitments related to our operations as well as our general and administrative activities 
our partners in our various projects have expectations that we will fund our proportionate share of drilling and related capital costs each year 
our commitments are expected to increase significantly as our operating partners increase their drilling activities and we incur additional cash calls in respect of these projects 
in the event that we are unable to maintain our funding obligations in respect of our projects  we may be deemed to have gone non consent  which will result in a project s other partners funding a well s operating costs without us 
if we go non consent on a well  the consequences to us likely will enable the consenting partners to recover their costs plus an agreed upon percentage typically to before we will be entitled to participate in any of the future economics of the 
table of contents well  if at all 
our general and administrative commitments principally include our office lease  under which we are contractually obligated until risks relating to our common stock our stock price and trading volume may be volatile  which could result in losses for our stockholders 
the equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility  which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities 
the market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business  our industry  or our operating performance and financial condition 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates  if any  of public market analysts  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors  conditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry  the success of our operating strategy  and the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 
many of these factors are beyond our control  and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock 
our insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our stock 
as of december  our executive officers  directors and affiliated persons beneficially own approximately of our common stock 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and affiliated persons will have significant influence to elect or defeat the election of our directors  amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws  effect or prevent a merger  sale of assets or other corporate transaction  and affect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
management s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  holders of our common stock must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
our existing credit agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends without lender consent 
any payment of cash 
table of contents dividends also will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
further  our current business strategy calls for the reinvestment of cash flow from operations back into our business 
accordingly  holders of our common stock will have to rely on capital appreciation  if any  to earn a return on their investment in our common stock 
the anti takeover effects of provisions of our charter  by laws  and shareholder rights plan  and of certain provisions of delaware corporate law  could deter  delay  or prevent an acquisition or other change in control of us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our amended certificate of incorporation  our by laws  our shareholder rights plan and delaware general corporation law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or our management which shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions include the following we are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval  with rights senior to those of our common shareholders  we have a shareholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the support of our board of directors and principal shareholders 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  or the dgcl 
in general  section of the dgcl prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder 
a business combination includes a merger  sale of or more of our assets and certain other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
for purposes of section  an interested stockholder includes any person that is the owner of or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation  an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation  at any time within three years immediately prior to the relevant date  and an affiliate or associate of the persons defined as an interested shareholder 
any one of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item description of properties 
we currently operate in three basins in the rocky mountain region of the united states the piceance basin  which is located in northwestern colorado  denver julesburg dj basin  which is located in eastern colorado and western nebraska and the williston basin  which is located in williams county  north dakota 
piceance basin teton s properties in the piceance basin consist of a working interest net revenue interest in a  acre block located in garfield county  colorado  townships ts w and ts w  
table of contents immediately to the northwest of grand valley gas field  the westernmost of the four gas fields that comprise the continuous  basin centered  tight gas sand accumulation the piceance fairway 
these properties are in the vicinity of major gas production from continuous basin centered  tight gas sand accumulations within the williams fork formation of the upper cretaceous mesaverde group and the shallower lower tertiary wasatch formation 
the primary targets for drilling on this large acreage position are the  thick  gas saturated sands of the middle and lower williams fork formation at approximately  in depth 
in addition  the subject acreage is surrounded on the west  east  and southeast by completed gas wells 
to the northwest of the block is the trail ridge gas field wasatch and mesaverde 
to the west  south  and east are gas wells of the greater grand valley field 
we estimate  based on current service company costs as well as our past drilling experience  that drilling and completion costs for a williams fork well will range between million and million 
based on currently approved field spacing rules  we and our partners in this acreage believe we can drill as many as wells on the  acre block with an estimated average bcf ultimate recovery per well 
our natural gas production in this area is gathered by the gathering system owned by us and our partners and is currently delivered to markets through a pipeline owned by encana  another operator in this area 
eastern dj basin we acquired our first interest in this play between april and july through a series of transactions that resulted in our accumulating an excess of  gross acres with a net revenue interest of approximately 
at the end of our undeveloped acreage position was approximately  gross acres in the eastern denver julesburg basin the dj basin located in nebraska on the nebraska colorado border which is located on the eastern flank of the dj basin in chase  dundy  perkins  and keith counties in nebraska 
the drilling target of this play is primarily the niobrara formation  within which is trapped biogenic gas in the beecher island chalk of the upper cretaceous niobrara formation 
the gas is contained in shallow structural traps at depths ranging from  feet 
the acreage is located approximately to miles to the east of the main niobrara gas productive trend that has been established to the west in yuma  phillips  and sedgwick counties  colorado and in duell and garden counties  nebraska 
based on current service company rates  we and our operating partner anticipate that gross drilling and completion costs for a niobrara well are approximately  in  we acquired an additional  gross acres in the dj basin through nebraska state acreage sales bringing our total gross acreage in the dj basin to  gross acres 
on december   we closed on an agreement to purchase an additional leasehold interest in the dj basin with an undisclosed third party 
the agreement called for the acquisition of approximately  gross acres 
approximately   net acres were within the teton noble ami and approximately  gross acres outside the ami 
noble agreed to accept its interest in the acreage within the ami 
as of december   our total gross acreage in the dj basin is  acres  of which  gross acres is in the teton noble ami and  gross acres is outside of the ami 
at december   we have a net acreage position of  net acres within the teton noble ami and  net acres outside the ami 
our interests in the oil and gas rights and leases are recorded directly to teton dj basin llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 

table of contents williston basin on may   we closed a definitive agreement with american oil and gas  inc american acquiring a working interest in approximately  gross acres in the williston basin located in north dakota for a total purchase price of approximately million  as further described below 
per the terms of the agreement  we paid american approximately million in cash at closing and would pay an additional million in respect of american s share of the drilling and completion costs of the first two planned wells through june  any portion of the million not paid to american for drilling and completion costs by june   will be paid to american on that date 
in addition to our obligation to fund american s share  we are also obligated to pay costs in respect of our own working interest of drilling and completion costs of such wells during the same time period 
as of december   we have paid to american approximately million of the initial obligation of million resulting in a remaining accrued purchase consideration of  in addition to our working interest and american s working interest  we have one other partner in the acreage evertson energy company evertson  who is the operator and has a working interest 
evertson began drilling the champion h well  a tri lateral horizontal test that was drilled to the mississippian bakken formation at a depth of about  feet  on september  the estimated cost for the champion h is approximately million to drill  complete and test 
as of the date of this report evertson was testing the champion h 
if economic recoveries are confirmed by the initial test well  a revised capital spending program will be announced later in if full field development occurs  the company estimates that there may be up to additional unrisked drilling locations on acre spacing

the following discussion and analysis of our plan of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance  financial condition  and prospects 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the rocky mountain region of the us we generate revenues by the production of oil and gas principally natural gas at this time from properties which we own independently or with other parties 
currently we have interests in three different plays we own a working interest in a drilling program in the piceance basin in western colorado on  gross acres  net to the company  a separate acreage play of  gross acres  net to the company in the eastern dj basin in eastern colorado and western nebraska and a separate acreage play of over  gross acres  net to the company in the williston basin in north dakota 
prior to july   our primary focus was oil and gas exploration  development and production in the russian federation and former commonwealth of independent states 
table of contents cis see note to the financial statements 
since the sale of our russian assets  our focus has been on acquiring and developing assets in north america  with a particular emphasis on the rocky mountain region in the united states 
at december   our piceance program had wells on production 
there was no production at december  with respect of the acreage in the dj and williston basins 
financial highlights for the year ended december  include the following we sold  mcf of natural gas from our piceance basin properties at an average wellhead price of per mcf 
actual price realization after fuel  gathering  marketing  and transportation averaged per mcf  resulting in revenues net to us of  our net loss from continuing operations increased to  in per share from  in per share 
on august   we closed on a public offering of  shares of our common stock  which was priced on july   at per share 
petrie parkman co  served as the sole underwriter and book running manager for the offering 
total shares delivered at closing included the underwriter s over allotment option to purchase  additional common shares  which was exercised at closing 
as a result of the underwriter s exercise of its over allotment option  net proceeds of the offering were million 
the following summarizes our operational highlights during we participated in the drilling of gross wells net to us in in the piceance basin 
as of december   we had gross wells net to us on production and drilled another gross wells of which gross wells have been drilled to the total depth net to us  of which all gross wells are planned to be on production in in may  we acquired from american a working interest in approximately  gross acres  net to us in the williston basin for a total purchase price of approximately million 
we are participating with american and evertson the operator in the drilling of one tri lateral horizontal well  the champion h 
currently  the champion h is being tested for production 
the estimated cost for the champion h well is approximately million to drill  complete and test 
we participated in the drilling of wells as part of the initial pilot program with noble energy  inc on our acreage block in the dj basin  which includes approximately  gross acres 
we were carried for our working interest on the first wells with noble 
ten of the wells were drilled in the chundy prospect area located in chase and dundy counties  nebraska  and of those wells have been logged  cased and fracture stimulated and are currently awaiting sales connection 
one well has been logged and cased  and awaiting completion  and wells were dry holes 
the other wells were drilled in the grant prospect area located in grant county  nebraska of which wells were logged  cased and are waiting on completion  wells were perforated and fracture stimulated  and wells were plugged and abandoned 
on march   the company announced that of the pilot wells in the chundy area were put on production by noble as part of a flow rate test to ascertain commercial viability 
additional wells will be connected during the near term as part of this test 
during  we also concentrated on identifying opportunities to acquire additional properties primarily in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
we are concentrating on close in exploration and or extension development projects involving resource plays in basins deemed to be prolific

including lease operating expenses and production taxes for  and  respectively  which costs represent of revenues combined  operating income from oil and gas activities for equates to  before depletion and depreciation  exploration costs  general and administrative expenses  accretion expense  and other income 
during  general and administrative expenses increased from  during to  a  increase which is primarily due to an increase in non cash charges associated with our stock based compensation with implementation of sfas r as described in greater detail below 
significant increases to general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to include an increase in compensation expense of  which increase was due primarily to  of non cash compensation expense of stock based grants as a result of the actual performance milestones associated with our long term incentive plan and our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard r share based payment  effective as of january  and a non cash expense of  associated with restricted stock grants 
in addition  compensation expense increased  as a result of an increase in the number of full time employees from employees in to employees in and a cash bonus expense increase of approximately  from to a full time cfo was hired to replace an outside contractor cfo  which increased salary and bonus costs  but reduced outside contractor fees as described below 
consulting expenses associated with engineering  marketing  investor relations and financial services rendered increased  in from office expense increased  in from due to the increased administrative and computer support as well as additional office space leased 
during the year ended december   certain general and administrative expenses were lower than in the prior year period legal and accounting costs decreased by  from the prior year period in of the  decrease   was due to non cash issuance of common stock for accounting and legal services rendered in in we received back  shares of common stock as a refund of accounting services that reduced our general and administrative expenses in valued at  the remaining

the improved results between and  were largely based on a combination of the commencement of revenues for our piceance operations coupled with a reduced staff and infrastructure associated with the closing of our russian related operations  which occurred at the beginning of the following summarizes our operational highlights during on february   we acquired a interest in piceance llc  which owned  acres in the piceance basin  for a total purchase price  including the fair value of stock and warrants issued  of approximately million

factors contributing to the decrease in administrative expense in included reduced due diligence costs associated with the pursuit of acquisitions including acquisitions that failed to close  elimination of our moscow  steamboat springs  and houston offices which were associated with our former russian operations  reduction in investor relations related expenses  and reduction of corporate personnel associated with our overseas operations 
significant changes in general and administrative expenses  exclusive of the  non cash charge relating to the issuance of stock for the year ended december  compared to include advertising and public relations and related consulting expenses decreased  in primarily due to the fact that we eliminated several consulting contracts in the second quarter of and expensed the costs to terminate such contracts during such quarter

outlook for the following summarizes our goals and objectives for continue to develop the piceance basin acreage 
increase our liquidity through increases in our senior credit facility borrowing base and consummation with other capital market transactions 
determine the commerciality of our dj basin play with noble and continue to develop the acreage as appropriate 

table of contents determine the commerciality of our williston basin play with evertson american and continue to develop the acreage as appropriate 
pursue additional oil and gas asset and project acquisitions including an operated property 
continue to build up our operating staff and related capabilities 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a cash balance of  and a working capital deficit of  we currently estimate the cost of our piceance development program to be approximately million for the year ending december  in addition  we are planning on additional development projects in the dj basin  conditioned on our evaluation of performance of the first test wells  that would increase our overall development plan by as much as million  including seismic  gathering lines and development drilling and completion facility costs 
our planned development and exploration expenses also could increase if any of the operations associated with our properties experience cost overruns 
in addition  our capital budget could be substantially increased if berry  as operator for the piceance play  increases the drilling program  noble  as operator for the dj basin play  increases the drilling program  and evertson  as operator for the williston play  increases the drilling program 
we anticipate that we will utilize working capital generated from our ongoing operations to meet some of our commitments 
in addition  in march  we filed s and s shelf registration statements for million each in financing capacity  which registration statements have been declared effective by the sec 
as discussed above  we closed on a public offering of  shares of our common stock  net proceeds of the offering were million 
as a result of the offering  we have million of financing capacity remaining on our s shelf registration 
we have not utilized any of our million s shelf registration 
we also may receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants and or options as we did during the years ended december  and at march   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding 
these warrants have a weighted average exercise price of per share and expire between april and december at march   options to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding 
these options have a weighted average exercise price of per share and expire between july and may in june  we established a million revolving credit facility with bnp paribas the credit facility 
the credit facility had an initial borrowing base of million  redetermined as follows  and matures on june  the credit facility provides for as much as million in borrowing capacity  depending upon a number of factors  such as the projected value of our proven oil and gas assets 
the borrowing base for the credit facility at any time will be the loan value assigned to the proved reserves attributable to our subsidiaries direct or indirect oil and gas interests 
the borrowing base will be redetermined on a semi annual basis  based upon an engineering report delivered by us from an approved petroleum engineer 
the credit facility is available for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
the borrowing base as redetermined by bnp paribas is million as of march  we expect that our current cash balances  combined with expected positive operating cash flow  amounts available from existing and anticipated increases in our senior debt facility  proceeds from the exercise of 
table of contents warrants and options and the use of our s and s shelf registrations will provide us with adequate resources to meet our capital needs for there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising capital from either the debt or equity markets in the future or increasing our borrowing base from the credit facility 
sources and uses of funds historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash provided by equity offerings 
these offerings may continue to play an important role in financing our business 
cash raised from third parties or generated through operations will be used for additional acquisitions or in connection with drilling programs associated with our current properties 
in addition  our credit facility has established a borrowing facility that will be used primarily for our developmental drilling and other capital expenditures 
as a result of our developmental drilling program progress  we expect that cash flow from operating activities also will contribute to our cash requirements during and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
cash flows and capital expenditures during the year ended december   we used  of cash in our operating activities 
this amount compares to  of cash used in our operating activities for the year the decrease of  of net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the growth in revenue in as compared to  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
our cash used in operating activities during increased by  due to higher accounts receivable balances attributed to revenue growth and one time cost recoveries due from noble under our average earning agreement 
our cash used in operating activities decreased by  during as a result of increased accounts payable and other accrued liability balances associated with the growth of the company 
in addition  during cash used in operating activities increased by  in respect to inventory and  in respect to discontinued operations  as compared to in respect to our investing activities  during the year ended december   we received cash of  in connection with the entering into the acreage earning agreement with noble involving our dj basin acreage 
during the same period  we incurred costs of  related to our drilling and completion operations in the piceance and the williston basin projects 
in respect to our financing activities during the year ended december   holders of  warrants exercised these warrants and purchased an equivalent number of common shares in us for net proceeds to us of  and holders of  stock options exercised these options and purchased an equivalent number of our common shares for net proceeds to us of  for the year ended december   we raised  from the exercised warrants to purchase common shares 
on october   we entered into a international swap dealers association inc  master agreement with bnp paribas to allow us to hedge our commodity pricing risk relative to our future oil and gas production 
in addition  we have a company hedging policy in place  if necessary  to protect a portion of our production against future pricing fluctuations 
although we have not yet hedged any of our future production beyond december   we will consider this strategy for future oil and gas production and future acquisitions 

table of contents our outstanding hedges as of december  are summarized below monthly volume cig commodity period mmbtu floor ceiling natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas the collared hedges shown above have the effect of providing a protective floor while allowing us to share in upward pricing movements 
consequently  while these hedges are designed to decrease our exposure to price decreases  they also have the effect of limiting the benefit of price increases beyond the ceiling 
for the natural gas contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the colorado interstate gas  or cig  price above the ceiling price or below the floor price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in the gain loss on hedging activities in of  the company plans to continue to enter into derivative contracts to decrease exposure to commodity price decreases

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations was based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of the financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas reserves  asset retirement obligations  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives and contingencies  and base those estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition oil and natural gas revenue is recognized monthly based on production and delivery 
we follow the sales method of accounting for our natural gas and crude oil revenue  so that we recognize sales revenue on all natural gas or crude oil sold to our purchasers at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and if collectibility of the revenue is probable 
processing costs for natural gas that are paid in kind are deducted from our revenues 
the volume of natural gas sold may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our working interest 
when this occurs  a gas imbalance is deemed to exist 
an imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under produced owner s to recoup its entitled share through future production 
natural gas imbalances can arise on properties for which two or more owners have the right to take production in kind 
in a typical gas balancing arrangement  each owner is entitled to an agreed upon percentage of a property s total production  however  at any given time  the amount of natural gas sold by each owner may differ from its allowable percentage 
two principal accounting practices have evolved to account for natural gas 
table of contents imbalances 
these methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of natural gas sales method or an owner s entitled share of the current period s production entitlement method 
if we used the entitlement method  our future reported revenues may be materially different than those reported under the sales method 
at december   there were no gas imbalances in respect of our gas balancing arrangements 
oil and gas hedging we have and plan to enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
to date  our hedging has been limited to the utilization of costless collars  which are generally placed with major financial institutions 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective and is reclassified to the gain loss on oil and gas hedging activities line item in our consolidated statements of income in the period that the hedged production is delivered 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in the fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we currently do not have any derivative contracts in place that qualify as cash flow hedges 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently reviewed internally 
the fair value is calculated as the present value of the difference between then current future period prices and the floor and ceiling value of our costless collar contracts 
our results of operations each period can be impacted by our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
successful efforts method of accounting we account for natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the 
table of contents unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine that proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required properly to account for the results 
delineation seismic data acquisition and analysis costs  which are performed to select development locations within an oil and gas field are typically considered a development cost and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
depreciation  depletion and amortization our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which incorporate assumptions regarding future 
table of contents development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of the developed proved properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the proved properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an adjustment will be made to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
we review the carrying values of our undeveloped leasehold interests as compared to comparable sales values 
given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
we did not record an impairment during the years ended december   or stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r to account for stock based compensation 
previously  we accounted for this compensation under the provisions of apb under apb  stock options did not result in any charge to earnings if the exercise price on the date of grant equaled or exceeded fair value market price on the grant date 
stock grants were charged to earnings on the vesting date based upon the market price of the stock on the date of the grant 
we accrue for anticipated vesting of stock grants in interim reporting periods based upon our best estimates at the time of the interim period of the conditions and criteria under which the options will vest 
these conditions and criteria include service through the vesting date  announced future terminations  performance criteria based upon most recent forecasts and market conditions where appropriate 
the estimates used are subjective and based upon management s judgment and may change over time as experience emerges 
changes to the interim accruals due to changes in the estimates of the conditions and criteria are recorded in the period in which the estimate changes occur 
during the year ended december   we recorded current compensation of  based on our compensation committee s final assessments of the progress made in the satisfaction of performance and service conditions for these awards that could vest at year end  provided that certain milestones were achieved 
the annual performance assessment is scored based on an evaluation of the degree of progress made in achieving each of threshold  base  and stretch objectives established by our compensation committee 
our compensation expense will increase or decrease in subsequent quarters based on management s progress toward the achievement of these objectives 
improved performance during the subsequent quarters of the year will increase compensation expense in those quarters whereas diminished performance will reduce compensation expense in subsequent quarters 
the ultimate compensation 
table of contents expense for the year will reflect our actual performance and its associated vesting of the particular ltip tranche 
the portion of the stock compensation expense pertaining to performance share units under our ltip for the year ended december  was  we recorded expense for the nine months ended september  of  based upon estimated annual expense of  we increased the amount of the estimated annual expense by  during the fourth quarter as a result of higher estimates of expected achievement of performance objectives 
under sfas r  we amortize the unvested portion of stock option grants over the vesting period at the fair value of the option  as described in note to the financial statements 
at december   there were  option grants unvested and during the year ended december  we amortized  to expense in respect to the unvested stock options 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
currently  we are providing a valuation allowance against the tax benefits of our net operating loss carry forward  because of the uncertainty of its realization 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties 
sfas no 
requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the estimated amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
based on our production  our income before income taxes for would have moved up or down approximately  for every change in natural gas prices 
we have begun entering into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
to date  our derivative contracts have been costless collars  although we evaluate other forms of derivative instruments as well 

table of contents on october   we entered into certain isda agreements with bnp paribas to allow us to hedge our commodity pricing risk relative to our future oil and gas production 
in addition  we have a company hedging policy in place  if necessary  to protect a portion of our production against future pricing fluctuations 
although we have not yet hedged any of our future production beyond december   we will consider this strategy for oil and gas production and future acquisitions 
our outstanding hedges as of december  are summarized below monthly volume cig commodity period mmbtu floor ceiling natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas the collared hedges shown above have the effect of providing a protective floor while allowing us to share in upward pricing movements 
consequently  while these hedges are designed to decrease our exposure to price decreases  they also have the effect of limiting the benefit of price increases beyond the ceiling 
for the natural gas contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the cig price above the ceiling price or below the floor price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in the gain loss on hedging activities in of  the company plans to continue to enter into derivative contracts to decrease exposure to commodity price decreases
