overview irobot provides robots that enable people to complete complex tasks in a better way 
founded in by roboticists who performed research at the massachusetts institute of technology  we have developed proprietary technology incorporating advanced concepts in navigation  mobility  manipulation and artificial intelligence to build industry leading robots 
our roomba floor vacuuming robot and scooba floor washing robot perform time consuming domestic chores  and our packbot tactical military robots perform battlefield reconnaissance and bomb disposal 
in addition  we are developing the small unmanned ground vehicle reconnaissance robot for the us army s fcs program and  in conjunction with deere company  the r gator unmanned ground vehicle 
we sell our robots to consumers through a variety of distribution channels  including chain stores and other national retailers  and our on line store  and to the us military and other government agencies worldwide 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we have developed expertise in all the disciplines necessary to build durable  high performance and cost effective robots through the close integration of software  electronics and hardware 
our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to develop next generation and new products  reducing the time  cost and risk of product development 
our significant expertise in robot design and engineering  combined with our management team s experience in military and consumer markets  positions us to capitalize on the expected growth in the market for robots 
over the past five years  we have sold more than million of our home floor care robots 
we have also sold more than of our packbot tactical military robots  most of which have been sold to the us military and deployed on missions in afghanistan and iraq 

table of contents although we have successfully launched consumer and military products  our continued success depends upon our ability to respond to a number of future challenges 
we believe the most significant of these challenges include increasing competition in the markets for both our consumer and military products  our ability to obtain us federal government funding for research and development programs  and our ability to successfully develop and introduce products and product enhancements 
initial public offering on november   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  comprised of  primary shares and  shares offered by selling stockholders  which includes the exercise of the over allotment option by the underwriters of the offering 
in connection with the offering  all of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock were converted into an equal number of shares of common stock 
the sale of the  shares of common stock in connection with our initial public offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and offering related expenses 
a summary of the terms of the offering can be found in our registration statement no 
on form s  as amended  as filed with the securities and exchange commission 
revenue we currently derive revenue from product sales and research and development services 
product revenue is derived from the sale of our various home floor care and packbot robots and related accessories 
research and development revenue is derived from the execution of contracts awarded by the us federal government  other governments and a small number of other partners 
in the future  we expect to derive increasing revenue from product maintenance and support services due to a focused effort to market these services and the expanding installed base of our robots 
we currently derive a majority of our product revenue from the sale of our home floor care robots and our packbot tactical military robots 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   product revenues accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   our funded research and development contracts accounted for approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to perform funded research and development work with the intent of leveraging the technology developed to advance our new product development efforts 
in the future  however  we expect that revenue from funded research and development contracts could grow modestly on an absolute dollar basis and represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue due to the anticipated growth in consumer and military product revenue 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december  approximately and  respectively  of our home robot product revenue resulted from sales to customers  primarily us retailers 
direct to consumer revenue generated through our irobot on line store accounted for of our home robot product revenue for the fiscal year ended december  compared to in the fiscal year ended december  in addition  and of military product revenue  and and of funded research and development contract revenue  resulted from orders and contracts with the us federal government in the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   sales to non us customers accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
our revenue from product sales is generated through sales to our retail distribution channels  our distributor network and to certain us and foreign governments 
in  when our roomba robot was first commercially introduced and throughout  we recognized revenue from our us consumer product sales on a sell through basis when retail stores sold our roomba robots to end users 
in the first quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from us consumer product sales on a sell in basis when our robots are shipped by us to the retail stores 
as a result of this change in accounting treatment  in the first quarter of we recognized million of product revenue from products shipped prior to this one time increase impacts period to period comparisons relating to revenue from sales of our military robots is recognized upon the later to occur of shipment or customer acceptance 

table of contents revenue from consumer product sales is significantly seasonal  with a majority of our consumer product revenue generated in the second half of the year in advance of the holiday season 
the timing of holiday season shipments could materially affect our third or fourth quarter consumer product revenue in any fiscal year 
revenue from our military robot sales and revenue from funded research and development contracts are occasionally influenced by the september fiscal year end of the us federal government  but are not otherwise significantly seasonal 
in addition  our revenue can be affected by the timing of the release of new products and the award of new contracts 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of raw materials and labor that go into the development and manufacture of our products as well as manufacturing overhead costs such as manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  logistics and warranty costs 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   cost of product revenue was and of total product revenue  respectively 
while raw material costs  which are our most significant cost items  generally have not fluctuated materially as a percentage of revenue since the introduction of our robots in  the cost for some materials have recently risen  including abs plastic and nickel for batteries 
there can be no assurance that our costs of raw materials will not increase 
labor costs also comprise a significant portion of our cost of revenue 
compared to our packbot tactical military robots  labor costs for our home floor cleaning robots comprise a greater percentage of the associated cost of revenue 
we outsource the manufacture of our home floor cleaning robots to a contract manufacturer in china 
while labor costs in china traditionally have been favorable compared to labor costs elsewhere in the world  including the united states  we believe that labor in china is becoming more scarce 
consequently  the labor costs for our home floor cleaning robots could increase in the future 
cost of contract revenue includes the direct labor costs of engineering resources committed to funded research and development contracts  as well as third party consulting  travel and associated direct material costs 
additionally  we include overhead expenses such as indirect engineering labor  occupancy costs associated with the project resources  engineering tools and supplies and program management expenses 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   cost of contract revenue was and of total contract revenue  respectively 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue varies according to the mix of product and contract revenue  the mix of products sold and the total sales volume 
currently  our consumer robots typically have a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue than our military robots 
for the years ended december  and december   gross profit was and of total revenue  respectively 
as a result of our change in accounting from a sell through to sell in basis in the first quarter of  we recognized million of gross profit in the first quarter of  which disproportionately increased our gross profit as a percentage of revenues in that quarter and in research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our engineers  costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development  and costs of test equipment used during product development 
we have significantly expanded our research and development capabilities and expect to continue to expand these capabilities in the future 
an example of this is the engineering design center we opened in india late in a substantial portion of our research and development is performed in the united states  although we maintain an increasing number of engineering personnel in india and hong kong to serve as a liaison between our us based engineering staff and our outsourced manufacturer in china 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative 
table of contents design and development of new products as we strive to enhance our ability to serve our existing consumer and military markets as well as new markets for robots 
accordingly  we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   research and development expense was million and million  or and of total revenue  respectively 
in addition to our internal research and development activities discussed above  we incur research and development expenses under funded development arrangements with both governments and other third parties 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   these expenses amounted to million and million  respectively 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses have been classified as cost of revenue rather than research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel  advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  fulfillment costs associated with direct to consumer sales through the irobot on line store  professional services costs  information systems and infrastructure costs  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
as we focus on increasing our market penetration and continuing to build brand awareness  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales for the foreseeable future  as we intend to continue aggressively building on the irobot brand 
we also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase due to the costs associated with being a public company  including costs associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  directors and officers liability insurance and increased professional services 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   selling  general and administrative expense was million and million  or and of total revenue  respectively 
fiscal periods historically  our fiscal year ended on december and our fiscal quarters ended on march  june  september and december reference to fiscal  for example  refers to the fiscal year ended december  beginning in fiscal  we began to operate and report using a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  each of our fiscal quarters ends on the saturday that falls closest to the last day of the third calendar month of the quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 

table of contents accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of consumer products under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title to the customer  provided the price is fixed or determinable  collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return for defective products only  rebates and price protection 
we have typically not taken product returns except for defective products 
accordingly  we reduce revenue for our estimates of liabilities for these rights at the time the related sale is recorded 
we establish a provision for sales returns for products sold by resellers directly or through our distributors based on historical return experience 
we have aggregated and analyzed historical returns from resellers and end users which form the basis of our estimate of future sales returns by resellers or end users 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
if actual returns from retailers differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
our returns reserve is calculated as a percentage of gross consumer product revenue 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our actual experience of returns would have a material impact on our quarterly and annual results of operations 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns 
the estimates and reserve for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
through  we recognized revenue on sales to certain distributors and retail customers upon their sale to the end user 
starting in the first quarter of  as a result of our accumulation of sufficient experience to reasonably estimate allowances for product returns  we adopted the standard industry practice of recognizing revenue on all sales upon delivery of product to distributors and retail stores and established a related allowance for future returns based upon historical experience 
if future trends or our ability to estimate were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions or increases to revenue may result based on this new experience 
under cost plus research and development contracts  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred plus a pro rata portion of the total fixed fee 
we recognize revenue on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
costs and estimated gross profits on contracts are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs and funding 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recorded or recognized  as the case may be  in the period in which the revisions are determined 
since many contracts extend over a long period of time  revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting earnings applicable to past performance in the current period 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
revenue earned in excess of billings  if any  is recorded as unbilled revenue 
billings in excess of revenue earned  if any  are recorded as deferred revenue 
accounting for stock based awards effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grants 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and  accordingly financial statement amounts 
table of contents for the prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  entities that become public companies after june  and used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments as a non public company for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
shall apply the provisions of sfas no 
r prospectively to new and or modified awards after the adoption of sfas no 
r 
companies should continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application of sfas no 
r using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards either the minimum value method under sfas no 
or the provisions of apb no 
and its related interpretive guidance 
accordingly  we did not record any cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
additionally  since we valued options under the minimum value method up to our initial public offering on november   options granted prior to this date had a zero expected volatility 
prior to our initial public offering  we had accounted for certain option grants under apb as of december   the deferred stock based compensation balance associated with these grants was million 
we will continue to recognize the associated stock based compensation expense  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 related to these shares of million  million  million and million for   and  respectively 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognized million of stock based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended december  for stock options granted subsequent to the initial public offering 
the unamortized fair value as of december  associated with these grants was million with a weighted average remaining recognition period of years 
the fair value of each option grant for the fiscal year ended december  was computed on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions fiscal year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected life years expected volatility the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury constant maturity rate  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant  commensurate with the expected life of the instrument 
the dividend yield is zero based upon the fact that we have never paid and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the expected term calculation is based upon the simplified method provided under sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under sab no 
 the expected term is developed by averaging the contractual term of the stock option grants or years with the associated vesting term typically to years 
given our initial public offering in november and the resulting short history as a public company  we could not rely solely on company specific historical data for purposes of establishing expected volatility 
consequently  we performed an analysis of several peer companies with similar expected option lives to develop an expected volatility assumption 
based upon the above assumptions  the weighted average fair value of each stock option granted for the fiscal year ended december  was 
we have assumed a forfeiture rate of for all stock options granted subsequent to the initial public offering with the exception of those issued to executives and directors for which a zero forfeiture rate has been assumed 
in the future  we will record incremental stock based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rates are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior stock based compensation expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates to value equity based compensation 
there is little experience or guidance with respect to developing these assumptions and models 
there is also uncertainty as to how the standard will be interpreted and applied as more companies adopt the standard and companies and their advisors gain experience with the standard 
sfas no 
r requires the 
table of contents recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more discussion 
accounting for income taxes deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have million of gross federal net operating loss carry forwards as of december  of this amount  million relates to stock option deductions for which the tax effected amount is approximately million which would be credited to additional paid in capital upon realization 
the use of these net operating loss carry forwards may be limited by changes in our ownership 
we expect that these net operating loss carry forwards will impact our tax liability over the next several years 
there  however  can be no assurance as to the rate at which these net operating loss carry forwards can be utilized  or as to whether there will be any other tax incentives available after we monitor the realization of our deferred tax assets based on changes in circumstances  for example  recurring periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations 
our income tax provision and our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and estimates 
if we continue to generate taxable income through profitable operations in future years we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined  excluding the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to stock compensation 
warranty we typically provide a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods  provide replacement products at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products 
we record estimated warranty costs  based on historical experience by product  at the time we recognize product revenue 
as the complexity of our products increases  we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced  and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory or its current estimated market value 
we write down inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
because of the seasonality of our consumer product sales and inventory levels  obsolescence of technology and product life cycles  we generally write down inventory to net realizable value based on forecasted product demand 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those that we project and this difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit if inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  if actual demand and market conditions are more favorable than those we estimated at the time of such a write down  our gross profit could be favorably impacted in future periods

the million increase in revenue from our home robots division was driven primarily by the initial distribution into the retail channel of our scooba floor washing robot  which was released late in  continued demand for our roomba floor vacuuming robot and an increase in net average selling prices 
total home floor care robots shipped in fiscal was approximately  units compared to approximately  units in fiscal included in this million growth was an increase of approximately million in sales through our direct on line store as compared to million of direct revenue in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our home robots products return reserve accrual rate based on an analysis that indicated that our actual customer return rates had decreased significantly and  accordingly  during the third quarter we revised our returns reserve rate and reduced the returns reserve as of october  as a result of this decrease  during the third quarter of  we recognized an additional million of home robots product revenue related to robots shipped both during the third quarter of and during prior periods 

table of contents the million increase in revenue from our government and industrial business for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a increase in the number of military robots shipped combined with a increase in associated net average selling prices  a increase in recurring contract revenues generated under funded research and development contracts and the one time impact of million associated with the united kingdom ministry of defence contract modification 
also included in this million growth was an increase of approximately million in product life cycle revenue robot spares  as compared to million of product life cycle revenue in fiscal  which was primarily driven by the increased demand for our military robots 
total military robot units shipped in fiscal was compared to in fiscal this unit increase was directly related to units shipped under our contract with the naval sea systems command for man transportable robotics systems 
cost of revenue fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in the fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the unit sales of our home floor care robots  a increase in the unit sales of our military robots and higher costs associated with a increase in recurring contract revenues generated under funded research and development contracts in fiscal as compared to fiscal the home robots division cost of revenue decreased as a percent of revenue by percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was attributable to the above mentioned increase in average selling prices offset by a increase in average unit costs as a result of a shift in the product mix of the home floor care robots that we sold 
in particular  the average unit cost increase was largely attributable to a significant number of scooba floor washing robots shipped in fiscal our scooba floor washing robot carries a higher per unit cost than our roomba floor vacuuming robot which represented nearly of home floor care robots shipped in fiscal the government and industrial robots division cost of revenue decreased as a percent of revenue by percentage points for fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the above mentioned increase in average selling prices  a reduction in the average unit cost of product sold  higher margins on increased product life cycle revenue and lower cost of warranty partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead 
gross profit fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue gross profit increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal from of revenue in fiscal this percentage increase in gross profit was the result of the home robots division gross profit increasing percentage points and the government and industrial gross profit increasing percentage points 
these increases were partially offset by the fact that the home robots division  which carries a higher overall gross profit than the government and industrial division  accounted for of total gross profit in fiscal as compared to in the fiscal included in the total gross profit for fiscal was million associated with the united kingdom ministry of defence 
table of contents contract modification  which accounted for percentage points of the year over year improvement in gross profit as a percent of revenue 
research and development fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total research and development as a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased by million or to million percent of revenue in fiscal  from million of revenue for fiscal the increase in research and development expense is primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefit related expenses attributed to increased headcount 
consulting and related material costs associated with internal research projects increased by million and million  respectively 
additionally  million of the increase related to increased occupancy and depreciation expenses that include the addition of the mysore  india office  which opened in late  as well as increased depreciation expense on computer equipment related to increased headcount 
these increases were offset by a reduction of million in internally funded research and development projects primarily related to the scooba floor washing robot  which was launched late in the fourth quarter of in fiscal  we intend to continue to invest in research and development to respond to and anticipate customer needs 
accordingly  we anticipate research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
overall research and development headcount increased to at december  compared to as of december   an increase of employees or growth 
in addition to our internal research and development activities discussed above  we incur research and development expenses under funded development arrangements with both governments and industrial third parties 
for fiscal these expenses amounted to million compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased headcount in our research and development function to employees at december  from employees at december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses have been classified as cost of revenue rather than research and development expense 
selling and marketing fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total selling and marketing as a percentage of total revenue selling and marketing expenses increased by million or to million of revenue in fiscal from million of revenue in fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily driven by an increase in home robot division selling and marketing expense of million over fiscal this increase was primarily made up of million of increased television advertising and related production costs  million increase in direct fulfillment costs associated with the million increase in our direct on line store sales  million increased cooperative advertising  million increased compensation and benefit related expense  million increased customer service costs and million increased sales commissions 
all of these increases are attributable to the increase in fiscal of million of home robot revenue as compared to fiscal government and industrial division selling and marketing expenses were up million for fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to million of increased bid and proposal activities  million of increased compensation and benefit related expense attributed to incremental headcount and million increased travel costs 
corporate sales and marketing increased million of which million 
table of contents relates to public relations expenses 
in fiscal  we expect to accelerate our investment in sales and marketing to increase brand awareness 
accordingly  we anticipate selling and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue 
overall selling and marketing headcount increased to at december  compared to as of december   an increase of employees or growth 
general and administrative fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands general and administrative as a percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million of revenue in fiscal from million of revenue in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily driven by an increase of million in compensation  benefits  occupancy  depreciation and other people related expenses due to increased headcount over the comparable period and million related to increases in software maintenance and general liability insurance 
also included in the million increase was million relating to costs incurred on professional accounting  legal and other costs associated with being a public company  including costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley  all of which were not required in as we were a private company for the majority of the year 
sfas r stock based compensation costs totaling million were recorded  a factor that did not exist in the comparable period 
in fiscal  we anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in support of expected globalization activities 
overall general and administrative headcount increased to at december  compared to as of december   an increase of employees or growth

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenue fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total revenue our revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue increased approximately million  or  in our consumer business and million  or  in our government and industrial business 
the increase in revenue from our home robots products was primarily driven by continued demand for our roomba floor vacuuming robots and to a lesser degree  for our scooba floor washing robot  as it was released late in during the year we added four retailers to our retail network  which accounted for of our total revenue during the period and increased the total number of retailers offering our products to during fiscal  we also reduced our consumer products return reserve accrual rate based on an analysis that indicated that our actual customer return rates had decreased significantly and  accordingly  during the third quarter we revised our returns reserve rate and reduced the returns reserve as of october  as a result of this decrease  during the third quarter of  we recognized an additional million of consumer product revenue related to robots shipped both during the third quarter of and during prior periods 
the increase in revenue from our government and industrial business in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of our military robots  including the shipment of of our packbot tactical military robots to the us navy  and a significant increase in contract revenues generated under funded research and development contracts  including under the future combat systems program 
our revenue in fiscal was positively impacted by our conversion in accounting for us consumer product sales from a sell through basis when retail stores sell our roomba robots to their customers to a sell in basis when our robots are shipped by us to the retail stores 
as a result of this conversion  in we recognized million of product revenue from products shipped by us prior to fiscal cost of revenue fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue our cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the unit sales of our packbot robots in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a million increase in costs associated with the million increase in contract revenue 
unit sales in our consumer business increased by approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal after giving effect to the impact of converting to sell in accounting in the first quarter of fiscal as described above  the increase was 
in addition to the changes in sales volume  the unit costs of manufacturing our consumer robots increased by approximately over the comparable period in fiscal related primarily to an increase in costs associated with the production of the second generation roomba robots and a shift in the mix of the consumer robots that we sold 
the unit costs of manufacturing our packbot robots decreased by approximately over the comparable period in fiscal primarily as a result of manufacturing economies of scale

for fiscal year these expenses amounted to million compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased headcount in our research and development function to employees at december  from employees at december in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses have been classified as cost of revenue rather than research and development expense

liquidity and capital resources at december  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million  short term investments of million and accounts receivable of million 
prior to our initial public offering in november  we funded our growth primarily with proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock for aggregate net cash proceeds of million  occasional borrowings under a working capital line of credit and cash generated from operations 
in the initial public offering  we raised million net of underwriting and professional fees associated with this offering 
we manufacture and distribute our products through contract manufacturers and third party logistics providers 
we believe that this approach gives us the advantages of relatively low capital investment and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels 
by leasing our office facilities  we also minimize the cash needed for expansion 
accordingly  our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements  computers  office furniture and product specific production tooling  internal use software and test equipment 
in fiscal and  we spent million and million  respectively  on capital equipment 

table of contents during  our strategy for delivering product to our retail customers changed from a model that emphasized container shipments directly to the retailer from china to a model emphasizing improved logistics capabilities that allow our retail partners to take possession of product on a domestic basis 
accordingly  our home robots product inventory consists of goods shipped to our domestic third party logistic providers for the fulfillment of domestic retail orders and direct to consumer sales 
our inventory of military products is minimal as they are generally built to order 
our contract manufacturers are responsible for purchasing and stocking the components required for the production of our products  and they invoice us when the finished goods are shipped 
our consumer product sales are  and are expected to continue to be  highly seasonal 
this seasonality typically results in a net use of cash in support of operating needs during the first half of the year with the low point generally occurring in the middle of the third quarter  and a favorable cash flow during the second half of the year 
in the past  we have relied on our working capital line of credit to cover the short term cash needs resulting from the seasonality of our consumer business 
discussion of cash flows net cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was million compared to net cash used by operating activities of million in fiscal and net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to net income of million and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued compensation of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of million  an increase in inventory of million  an increase in other assets of million  and a decrease in provision for contract settlement and deferred revenue of million 
in addition  in fiscal  we had depreciation and amortization of approximately million and amortization of deferred compensation of million  both of which are non cash expenses 
the increase in accounts receivable  inventory and liabilities in fiscal are directly attributable to the growth in revenue from the comparable period in fiscal the cash used by our operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventory of million  an increase in other current assets of million  and an increase in unbilled revenue of million  offset by net income of million  and an increase in liabilities of approximately million

net cash provided by our financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds of million from the issuance of a series of convertible preferred stock  approximately million from exercises of common stock options and approximately million from the issuance of restricted stock  offset by million for repayment of borrowings under our working capital line of credit 

table of contents the majority of our long lived assets for the years ended december   december  and are located in the united states 
however  we have invested in production tooling for the manufacture of the roomba and scooba product lines in china 
we currently have a million accumulated deficit as a result of significant losses incurred through  largely attributable to our investment in internally funded research and development 
based on our historical product development efforts  we launched our first commercial products  our roomba floor vacuuming robot and our packbot tactical military robot  in fiscal since fiscal  our revenue has significantly increased  our investment in internally funded research and development has declined as a percentage of revenue  and we achieved profitability in fiscal years  and we have not invested significantly in property  plant and equipment  primarily as a result of our outsourced approach to manufacturing that provides significant flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
our consumer revenue has been highly seasonal 
this seasonality tends to result in the net use of cash during the first half of the year and significant generation of cash in the second half of the year 
given the recent success of our products and resulting growth in revenue  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
working capital facility on may   we obtained a working capital line of credit with a bank under which we can borrow up to million  including a million sub limit for equipment financing 
interest accrues at a variable rate based on prime or published libor rates 
the line expires on may  at which time all advances will be immediately due and payable 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding and million available under our working capital line of credit 
borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets other than our intellectual property 
the credit facility restricts our ability to incur or guaranty additional indebtedness  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  make loans or investments  sell assets  pay dividends or make distributions on  or repurchase  our stock  or consolidate or merge with other entities 
in addition  we are required to maintain quarterly tangible net worth thresholds based on our stockholders equity under the credit facility that vary by quarter based on anticipated seasonality in our business 
these operating and financial covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations  engage in business activities or expand or pursue our business strategies 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
to the extent we are unable to satisfy those covenants in the future  we will need to obtain waivers to avoid being in default of the terms of this credit facility 
in addition to a covenant default  other events of default under our credit facility include the filing or entry of a tax lien  attachment of funds or material judgment against us  or other uninsured loss of our material assets 
if a default occurs  the bank may require that we repay all amounts then outstanding 
working capital and capital expenditure needs we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and operating leases  all of which we anticipate funding through our existing working capital line of credit  working capital and funds provided by operating activities 
we do anticipate making significant capital commitments in the next twelve months for expenditures associated with the planned move to our new corporate headquarters on or about may  these expenditures will be jointly funded by the landlord for this site and by the company 
other than this project  we do not currently anticipate significant investment in property and 
table of contents equipment  and we believe that our outsourced approach to manufacturing provides us with flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available through our working capital line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next twelve months 
in the event that our revenue plan does not meet our expectations  we may eliminate or curtail expenditures to mitigate the impact on our working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies  and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
moreover  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations  and cash from short term borrowing are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
contractual obligations we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under our working capital line of credit  leases for office space and minimum contractual obligations for services 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than year years years years total in thousands operating leases minimum contractual payments total on february   we entered into a lease agreement for our new corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts to which we expect to relocate on or about may  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk nearly all of our revenue is derived from transactions denominated in us dollars  even though we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with operating expenses of our foreign operations  but we believe this exposure to be immaterial 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december  the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities  commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents were held in money market accounts and our short term investments were comprised of auction rate securities 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under our bank line of credit 
the advances under this line of credit bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the prime rate or the published libor rate at the time of the borrowing 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our working capital line of credit
