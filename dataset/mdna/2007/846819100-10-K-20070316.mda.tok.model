these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within the company s operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of operations  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the unit has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentives  which historically have not been significant 
the collectibility of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized 
inventory estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventory are based upon current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may be required 
warranties the company s policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale and periodically adjust the provision to reflect actual experience 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty agreements 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for field retrofit campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
see also note  commitments and contingent liabilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this k for further information regarding warranties 
equity compensation sfas r  share based payment  addresses the accounting for share based employee compensation and was adopted by spartan motors  inc on january  utilizing the modified prospective approach 
the effect of applying sfas r and further information on spartan motors  inc equity compensation plans  including inputs used to determine fair value of options is disclosed in note to the financial statements  sfas r requires that share options awarded to employees are recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at grant date 
the fair market value of options granted under the company s stock option plans was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for inputs such as interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and specific employee exercise behavior patterns based on statistical data 
some of the inputs we use are not market observable and have to be estimated or derived from availab le data 
use of different estimates would produce different option values  which in turn would result in higher or lower compensation expense recognized 
to value options  several recognized valuation models exist 
none of these models can be singled out as being the best or most correct one 
the model we apply is able to handle some of the specific features included in the options we grant  which is the reason for its use 
if we were to use a different model  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using a different valuation model could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
fair value could be either higher or lower than the ones produced by the model we apply and the inputs we used 
new and pending accounting policies in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
interpretation no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet determined the affect the adoption of interpretation no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations but does not anticipate a material impact 
effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s debt  if any  is generally tied to the prime and libor rates so that increases affecting interest rates may be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as six months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the pass through of cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a

the company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to the company 
as of the date of this report  the company does not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of its primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report
