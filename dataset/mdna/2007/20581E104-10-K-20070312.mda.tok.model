for accounting purposes  the merger of old comsys with venturi was treated as a reverse merger in which old comsys was deemed to be the acquirer 
the financial data and discussion and analysis set forth below relating to all periods prior to the merger on september  reflect the historical results of old comsys 
the financial data and discussion and analysis set forth below relating to periods subsequent to september  reflect financial results of comsys after giving effect to the merger and include venturi s results of operations from the effective date of the merger 
the historical data presented below is not indicative of future results 
our business our mission is to become the leading provider of it staffing services in the united states 
we intend to continue pursuing this mission through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 
industry trends that affect our business include rate of technological change  rate of growth in corporate it budgets  penetration of it staffing in the general workforce  outsourcing of the it workforce  and consolidation of supplier bases 
we anticipate our growth will be primarily generated from greater penetration of our service offerings with our current clients  introducing new service offerings to our customers and obtaining new clients 
our strategy for achieving this growth includes expanding our geographic presence  cross selling our vendor management solutions and project solutions services to existing it staffing customers  aggressively marketing our services to new clients  expanding our range of value added services  enhancing brand recognition and making strategic acquisitions 
the success of our business depends primarily on the volume of assignments we secure  the bill rates for those assignments  the costs of the consultants that provide the services and the quality and efficiency of our recruiting  sales and marketing and administrative functions 
our brand name  our proven track record  our recruiting and candidate screening processes  our strong account management team and our efficient and consistent administrative processes are factors that we believe are key to the success of our business 
factors outside of our control  such as the demand for it services  general economic conditions and the supply of qualified it professionals  will also affect our success 
our revenue is primarily driven by bill rates and billable hours 
most of our billings for our staffing and project solutions services are on a time and materials basis  which means we bill our customers based on pre agreed bill rates for the number of hours that each of our consultants works on an assignment 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
general economic conditions  macro it expenditure trends and competition may create pressure on our pricing 
increasingly  large customers  including those with preferred supplier arrangements  have been seeking pricing 
table of contents discounts in exchange for higher volumes of business or maintaining existing levels of business 
billable hours are affected by numerous factors  such as the quality and scope of our service offerings and competition at the national and local levels 
we also generate fee income by providing vendor management and permanent placement services 
our principal operating expenses are cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of services is comprised primarily of the costs of consultant labor  including employees  subcontractors and independent contractors  and related employee benefits 
approximately of our consultants are employees and the remainder are subcontractors and independent contractors 
we compensate most of our consultants only for the hours that we bill to our clients  which allows us to better match our labor costs with our revenue generation 
with respect to our consultant employees  we are responsible for employment related taxes  medical and health care costs and workers compensation 
labor costs are sensitive to shifts in the supply and demand of it professionals  as well as increases in the costs of benefits and taxes 
the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are salaries  selling and recruiting commissions  advertising  lead generation and other marketing costs and branch office expenses 
our branch office network allows us to leverage certain selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising and back office functions 
our back office functions  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting  are consolidated in our customer service center in phoenix  arizona  which operates on a peoplesoft platform 
we also have a proprietary  web enabled front office exchange fox that facilitates the identification  qualification and placement of consultants in a timely manner 
we maintain a national recruiting center  a centralized call center for scheduling sales appointments and a centralized proposals and contract services department 
we believe this scalable infrastructure allows us to provide high quality service to our customers and will facilitate our internal growth strategy and allow us to continue to integrate acquisitions rapidly 
historically  old comsys fiscal year ended on december st  while venturi s fiscal year ended on the sunday closest to december st 
in connection with the merger  we adopted venturi s fiscal year end 
accordingly  our fiscal year end for  and was december   january  and january   respectively 
overview of results our three stated priorities for were internal growth  focus on our balance sheet and pursuit of selected acquisitions 
we made the following progress against each during the year 
our revenues grew in from includes a full year of revenue from our fourth quarter acquisition of pure solutions 
revenue per billing day increased approximately million  from million in to million in growth was strong in all of our service lines 
in our staffing service line  our average headcount grew and we improved billing rates and spreads  all of which contributed to revenue and gross margin growth 
we ended the year at approximately  billable consultants  which was unchanged from the end of this was due to greater than expected seasonal fall off at several of our larger clients related to budget constraints and holiday shut downs 
our managed solutions service line had strong growth during  and we now have over billion of annualized spend in our vendor management service line 
we continue to emphasize our sap and sas service offerings and were selected as a sap services partner in the fourth quarter of although permanent placement revenues were strong in  this remains a smaller service line for us by design 
we do believe the strength in the permanent placement portion of the market supports the expectation that the current economic expansion has some longevity 
in addition to strong revenue growth  we increased our gross margin from in to in  or million  due to the increased spreads in staffing  the addition of pure solutions  and the growth in managed solutions and permanent placement activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from to  but as a percentage of revenues rose only from to 
approximately one third of the dollar increase was in commissions paid out due to the revenue growth 
the remainder was primarily due to compensation costs  including payments under incentive based plans primarily for our operations management and company officers  severance for our former ceo and general counsel and stock based compensation 
we implemented sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  in the beginning of  and the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement is discussed herein and in the footnotes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents our second priority was to continue our focus on the balance sheet  with a view towards streamlining operations  improving working capital management and improving our financial flexibility 
we were successful in completing the transition of our long term debt into a traditional lower cost asset based arrangement 
the details of the changes in our financings are discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
the interest savings these transactions will generate are significant 
we increased cash flow from operating activities from million in to million in due to the increase in net income and improved working capital management 
our net income for included a tax refund and related interest of million  which was used to pay down debt 
under the terms of our credit facilities  all cash flow generated by our operations net of approved capital spending levels and acquisition costs are used to pay down our debt balances 
our total debt at the end of the year was million  down from million at the end of and million at our seasonal peak at the end of the first quarter of there are seasonal increases in our debt levels during the first quarter of each year  however  we expect to make further reductions against our debt in management of accounts receivable was the driver in our improved working capital 
we decreased our days sales outstanding from days at the end of to days at the end of due primarily to the collection of old balances and improved timeliness and accuracy of billings 
our vendor management services have grown and our accounts receivable related to this service line at the end of the year was approximately million 
the associated revenue is recorded on a net basis and was approximately million in the fourth quarter of our third priority was to continue to pursue selected acquisitions 
our sector is still highly fragmented  and we expect to use the acquisition process to add market share or extend our service lines 
we did not complete any acquisitions during as we continued to be very selective in choosing the opportunities we might pursue 
we are continuing to look for opportunities that will allow us to expand our scale  add complementary service offerings to our managed solutions group or potentially diversify into other high value staffing markets 
outlook as we enter  we plan on keeping our priorities straightforward 
we will continue to keep internal growth at the top of our list  and will focus on sales  marketing and recruiting to our core customer base and on adding new customers throughout the year 
we are also evaluating several new markets for one or more additional new offices in continuing improvements in efficiency will also be a priority  and we expect to devote considerable attention to process improvements  especially in sales and recruiting and in our front and back offices  and on achieving improvements in working capital management 
and lastly  we will continue to look for acquisitions that meet our criteria  which may include entering into other high value staffing segments 
we have benefited from low book tax rates and minimal cash income tax related payments for some time now  and we do not expect them to last indefinitely if we continue to be profitable 
the merger on september   old comsys completed a merger transaction with venturi  a publicly traded it and commercial staffing company  in which comsys holding  inc was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of venturi 
concurrent with the merger  we sold venturi s commercial staffing business for million in cash and the assumption of approximately million in liabilities 
at the effective time of the merger  we changed our name to comsys it partners  inc and issued new shares of our common stock to the stockholders of old comsys  resulting in such stockholders owning approximately of our outstanding common stock at that time on a fully diluted basis 
since former old comsys stockholders owned a majority of our outstanding common stock upon consummation of the merger  old comsys was deemed the acquiring company for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
we have completed the integration of the legacy businesses of old comsys and venturi

the proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the prior credit facilities with merrill lynch capital and the syndicate of lenders 
we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to this transaction that resulted from the write off of certain unamortized deferred financing costs 
we made the first scheduled principal payment on the senior term loan in the first quarter of in may  we received a federal income tax refund  which  with interest  totaled million 
we used all of this cash to pay down the principal balance of the senior term loan 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  this principal payment reduced the scheduled quarterly payments to million  and we paid the first of these reduced payments in the second quarter of on september   the senior credit agreement and term loan credit agreement were amended 
among other things  the amendments provided for i an increase in our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to million from million and ii an increase in the senior term loan to million from million  which was the principal balance prior to the amendments

we incurred charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to the early repayment of the second lien term loan  the write off of certain deferred financing costs and certain expenses incurred in connection with this refinancing  of which million was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt and million was included in interest expense 
in addition  we capitalized approximately million of costs associated with this refinancing in the fourth quarter of the term loan and loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus a margin that can range from to or  at our option  the prime rate plus a margin that can range from to  each depending on our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee of per annum of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and fees for each letter of credit issued under the facility 
we and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the loans and other obligations under the senior credit agreement 
the obligations under the senior credit agreement and the related guaranties are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of us and our us subsidiaries  as well as the shares of capital stock of our direct and indirect us subsidiaries and certain of the capital stock of our first tier non us subsidiaries 
prior to our december   refinancing  our interest rates for the revolving credit facility were libor plus a margin that could range from to or  at our option  the prime rate plus a margin that could range from to  each depending on our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio 
the senior term loan interest rates were libor plus a margin that could range from to or  at our option  the prime rate plus a margin that could range from to  each depending upon our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and designated reserves

at december   we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million at interest rates ranging from to per annum weighted average rate of and excess borrowing availability of million for general corporate purposes 
the principal balance of the senior term loan on that date was million with an interest rate of 
we pay a fee on outstanding letters of credit equal to the libor margin then applicable to the revolving credit facility 
as of december   outstanding letters of credit totaled million and the fee was annually 
debt compliance our ability to continue operating is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities 
the senior credit agreement contains customary covenants and events of default  including the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio and a total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  as defined 
these agreements also place restrictions on our ability to enter into certain transactions without the approval of the lenders  such as the payment of dividends  disposition and acquisition of assets and the assumption of contingent obligations 
the senior credit agreement provides for mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and currently have no intention of paying them in the future 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements and we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants throughout the senior credit agreement contains various events of default  including failure to pay principal and interest when due  breach of covenants  materially incorrect representations  default under other agreements  bankruptcy or insolvency  the occurrence of specified erisa events  entry of enforceable judgments against us in excess of million not stayed  and the occurrence of a change of control 
if an event of default occurs  all commitments under the revolver may be terminated and all of our obligations under the senior credit agreement could be accelerated by the lenders  causing all loans outstanding including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable 
in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency  acceleration of our obligations under these credit facilities is automatic 
interest rate swap and cap we have historically been subject to market risk on all or a part of our borrowings under bank credit lines  which have variable interest rates 
effective february   we entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap which we terminated october  the swap agreement and cap agreement were contracts to effectively exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed rate payments over the life of the instruments 
the notional amount was used to measure interest to be paid or received and did not represent the exposure to credit loss 
the purpose of the swap and cap was to limit exposure to increases in interest rates on the 
table of contents notional amount of bank borrowings over the term of the swap and cap 
the swap was based on a million notional amount at a rate of and the cap was based on a million notional amount at a rate of 
at january   the interest rate swap and cap were recorded at fair value  based on an amount estimated by merrill lynch capital  which represents the amount that merrill lynch capital would have paid us at january  if the swap and cap had been terminated at that date 
the combined net fair value at january  was million  which was included in our consolidated balance sheet in noncurrent assets 
effective with the repayment of our debt on december   the expected cash flows that the swap and cap were designated to hedge against were no longer probable 
as a result  the swap and the cap were no longer designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result  amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with changes in fair value of the hedges were reversed to interest expense 
changes in fair value of the swap and cap were recorded in the statement of operations subsequent to december  we recorded million as a reduction of interest expense in the fourth quarter of on october   we cancelled the swap and cap agreements and received a cash settlement of million  which was recorded as a reduction to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations

both wachovia investors  inc and inland links have representatives on our board of directors 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering 
we paid approximately million of expenses in the first quarter of related to this offering

in addition  in  we received a federal income tax refund and related interest totaling million 
our positive cash flows from operating activities in were the result of higher operating income than in the prior year  when we recorded an operating loss 
cash used in operating activities in included accrued interest paid on senior subordinated notes of million and integration and restructuring costs of million  offset in part by a federal income tax refund of million and our receipt of million with respect to a receivable previously written off 
cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements and working capital requirements related to the growth in revenue 
cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in and million in our cash flows associated with investing activities in included capital expenditures of million 
additionally  in june  we made an earnout payment to the former owners of pure solutions in the amount of million 
in december  an additional earnout payment of million was accrued for payment in january our cash flows associated with investing activities in included capital expenditures in the amount of million and million of 
table of contents cash paid for the acquisition of pure solutions  inc cash used in investing activities in included million of expenditures associated with the merger with venturi 
capital expenditures for related primarily to software enhancements to our peoplesoft system  hardware for our internal information systems and leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures in are currently expected to be approximately million to million 
cash used for financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows associated with financing activities in primarily represent repayments of long term debt  partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows associated with financing activities in primarily represent proceeds from the issuance of common stock  net of the redemption of our preferred stock 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily represent net borrowings of long term debt of million to fund operating and investing activities and to pay financing costs of million associated with the credit agreements in place at that time 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we maintain a zero balance in our primary domestic cash accounts 
any excess cash in our accounts is swept on a daily basis and applied to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility  and any cash needs are satisfied through borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
cash recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  and january  in the amount of million and million  respectively  represents cash balances at our toronto and united kingdom subsidiaries 
in addition  the amount also includes cash at our pure solutions subsidiary 
we expect cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections and the timing of tax and other payments 
we believe the most strategic uses of our cash are repayment of our long term debt  making strategic acquisitions and the start up costs associated with new locations 
there are no transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital 
contractual and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total one year years years years short and long term debt interest payments on short and long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitment expiration per period less than more than other commercial commitments total one year years years years letters of credit letters of credit secure certain office leases and insurance programs 
in connection with the merger and the sale of venturi s commercial staffing business  we placed million of cash and  shares of our common stock in separate escrows pending the final determination of certain state tax and unclaimed property assessments 
the shares were released from escrow on september  in accordance with the merger agreement  while the cash remains in escrow 
we have recorded liabilities for amounts management believes are adequate to resolve all of the matters that these escrows were intended to cover  however  management cannot ascertain at this time what the final outcome of these assessments will be in the aggregate and it is reasonably possible that management s estimates could change 
the escrowed cash is included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  also referred to as gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates include the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  the recoverability of goodwill  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves for medical costs  tax related contingencies and realization of deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our operations and include the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of comsys it partners  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
revenue recognition revenues under time and materials contracts are recorded at the time services are performed 
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of time incurred to total estimated time to complete the project 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recorded in the period the losses are determinable 
estimated losses on incomplete projects are determined by comparing the revenues remaining to be recognized on fixed price contracts to judgments as to estimated time and cost required to complete the projects 
if the estimated cost to complete a project exceeds the remaining revenue to be recognized  the excess cost is recorded as a loss provision on the contract 
our revenues vary from period to period based on several factors that include the billable headcount during the period  the number of billing days during the period  and the average bill rate during the period 
revenues from services are shown net of rebates and discounts relating primarily to volume related discount structures and prompt payment discounts under contracts with our clients 
such rebates and discounts totaled million of gross revenues  million of gross revenues and million of gross revenues for  and  respectively 
we report revenues from vendor management services net of the related pass through labor costs 
we also report revenues net for payrolling activity 
payrolling is defined as a situation in which we accept a client identified it consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee 
revenues generated by payrollees are recorded net of labor costs 
permanent placement fee revenues are recorded when candidates begin their employment 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets we assess recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested annually for impairment  unless an event occurs or circumstances change during the year that reduce or may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value  in which event an impairment charge may be required during the year 
the annual test requires estimates and judgments by management to determine valuations for each reporting unit 
we have selected december as the date on which we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
we performed our annual impairment test as of december   and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
different assumptions related to future cash flows  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates could result in an impairment charge  which would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income and a reduction in asset values on the balance sheet 
at december   and january  total goodwill was million and million  respectively 
our intangible assets other than goodwill represents acquired customer bases and are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer base  ranging from two to eight years 
at december   and january   net intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate 
table of contents intangibles or other long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets 
we believe that all of our long lived assets are fully realizable as of december  collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical level of write offs and judgments management makes about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
for  we also considered the impact on collections of the integration of the old comsys and venturi back office systems 
further  we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
additional allowances may be required if the economy or the financial condition of our customers deteriorates 
if we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of december   and january   the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
due to the limited trading history of our common stock following the merger  expected stock price volatility is based on an analysis of the actual realized historical volatility of our common stock as well as that of our peers 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line attribution method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using the straight line attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december   that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
self insurance we offer employee benefits  including workers compensation and health insurance  to eligible employees  for which we are self insured for a portion of the cost 
we retain liability up to  for each workers compensation claim and up to  annually for each health insurance claim for which we are not insured 
these self insurance costs are accrued using estimates to approximate the liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we believe that our estimation processes are adequate and our estimates in these areas have consistently been similar to actual results 
however  estimates in this area are highly subjective and future results could be materially different 
accrued bonuses we pay bonuses to certain executive management  field management and corporate employees based on  or after giving consideration to  a variety of financial performance measures 
executive management  field management  and certain corporate employees bonuses are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year  based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets 
variances in actual results versus budgeted 
table of contents amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore the estimates of the required accruals 
accordingly  the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals 
income tax assets and liabilities we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
although our net deferred tax asset is substantially offset with a valuation allowance  a portion of our deferred tax expense is offset to goodwill 
this portion of deferred tax expense represents the consumption of pre merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero basis 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of deferred tax expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively 
we record an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these deferred tax items represent expenses or operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which will result in tax deductions over varying future periods 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income  timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be available to us 
we record an estimated tax liability or tax benefit for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent upon various matters  including resolution of tax audits  and may differ from amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded as a provision or benefit to income tax expense in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability or benefit differs from the recorded amount 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt the new requirements in our fiscal first quarter of the cumulative effects  if any  of adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and we will adopt the new requirements in our fiscal first quarter of we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to interest rate  foreign currency and equity price fluctuations 
our use of derivative instruments has historically been insignificant and it is expected that our use of derivative instruments will continue to be minimal 
interest rate risks outstanding debt under our credit facilities at december  was approximately million 
interest on borrowings under the facilities is based on the prime rate or libor plus a variable margin 
based on the outstanding balance at december   a change of in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
foreign currency risks our primary exposures to foreign currency fluctuations are associated with transactions and related assets and liabilities related to our operations in canada and the united kingdom 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
these operations are not material to our overall business 
equity market risks the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future
