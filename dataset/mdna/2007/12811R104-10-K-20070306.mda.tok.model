item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we provide investment advisory services to institutions and individuals  managing billion in client assets at december  we offer our clients a variety of investment products designed to suit their individual investment needs 
as described in the business section within part i  the way that we view our business has evolved  and as a result we have revised the way that we categorize certain accounts  assets under management and the respective investment management fees 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation 
assets under management our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management 
the following table details our assets under management  based on the five types of investment product types we offer in the mutual fund and separate account categories  at december   and in millions mutual funds open end funds closed end funds total mutual funds separate accounts institutional accounts managed accounts alternative investments total separate accounts total assets under management in order to increase our assets under management and expand our business  we must develop and market investment products that suit the individual investment needs of our target clients investors seeking superior risk adjusted returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our assets under management and our ability to continue to attract clients will depend on a variety of factors  including  among other things purchases and redemptions of shares of the open end funds and other investment products  fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets under management  our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with best in class service  the relative investment performance of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management and broader financial services sectors  investor sentiment and confidence  and our introduction of new investment strategies and products and our decision to close strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients 
investment products mutual funds mutual funds include registered open end funds and registered closed end funds 
open end funds 
open end funds are continually offered and are not listed on an exchange 
open end funds issue new shares for purchase and redeem shares from those shareholders who sell 
the share price for purchases and redemptions of open end funds is determined by each fund s net asset value  which is calculated at the end of each business day 
assets under management in open end funds vary as a result of both market appreciation and depreciation and the level of new purchases or redemptions of shares of a fund 
investment management fees are our principal source of revenue from open end mutual funds and are derived from assets under management 
we offer several share classes in each open end fund to provide investors with alternatives to pay for commissions  distribution and service fees 
closed end funds 
closed end funds typically sell a finite number of shares to investors through underwritten public offerings  unlike open end funds  which continually offer new shares to investors 
after the public offerings  investors buy closed end fund shares from  and sell those shares to  other investors through an exchange or broker dealer market 
all four of the closed end funds that we manage currently use leverage by issuing preferred securities  which increase their total assets 
assets under management in closed end funds vary due to the amount of assets raised in underwritten public offerings  the amount of leverage utilized and market appreciation or depreciation 
our revenues from closed end funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage 
in addition  in a typical underwritten public offering  investors are charged a commission by the selling firms 
we do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closed end fund shares  although we may pay asset based distribution and service fees  as well as one time distribution and service fees to underwriters for underwriting public offerings of closed end funds 
separate accounts separate accounts include institutional accounts  managed accounts for high net worth investors and alternative investments 
fund flows into and out of such accounts  which we refer to as purchases and redemptions  affect our level of assets under management 
assets under management from these accounts also vary as a result of market appreciation and depreciation 
our revenues from separate accounts are derived from investment management fees that we charge  including performance fees in some cases 
provided below is a brief differentiation of these accounts institutional accounts are separately managed accounts for institutional investors  such as public and private pension funds  public funds and endowment funds  and are offered directly by us through institutional consultants and through national and regional broker dealers 
managed accounts are separately managed accounts for high net worth investors offered primarily through national and regional broker dealers 
alternative investments include private investment vehicles  primarily hedge funds  offered directly by us to qualified individual and institutional investors 
revenues our revenues are substantially comprised of investment management fees earned under contracts with the mutual funds and separate accounts managed by us 
the distribution of assets under management among our investment products also will have an impact on our investment management fees  as some products carry different fees than others 
investment management fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management  market appreciation or depreciation  investment performance relative to benchmarks and competitors  level of net purchases and redemptions  which represent the sum of new client assets  additional funding from existing clients  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares  a determination by the independent trustees of the mutual funds to terminate or significantly alter the funds investment management agreements with us  and increased competition 
our revenues also are comprised of distribution and underwriting fees 
asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  discussed below  are a significant component of distribution and underwriting fees 
distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management generally and by share class  market appreciation or depreciation  and the level of purchases and redemptions 
investment management fees investment management fees that we receive from mutual funds for which we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset basis 
investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor are computed quarterly  either in advance or in arrears  based on the assets under management balance at the beginning or end of the quarterly period 
we recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services 
we may earn performance fees in addition to investment management fees 
a performance fee structure would include both an asset based fee and a fee based upon the performance of the portfolio 
historically  performance fees have not been a material source of revenues for us 
however  in the future  as we offer products that have performance based fees  including alternative products  we expect performance fees to become a more significant source of revenues 
distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting fees include asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  front end sales charges and contingent deferred sales charges 
rule b distribution and or service fees are asset based fees that the open end funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b of the investment company act 
these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets under management in specific share classes of the open end funds 
these fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets under management and the relative mix of assets among share classes 
rule b fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period  as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions that were previously paid by us to third parties 
we earn front end sales charges on the sale of class a shares of open end funds  which provide for a sales charge at the time of investment 
we retain a portion of the applicable sales charge and  if calamos financial services acts as the broker dealer for the account  we retain the entire sales charge 
sales charges are waived on sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum dollar amounts and other specified conditions 
sales charges fluctuate with both the level of class a share sales and the mix of class a shares offered with and without a sales charge 
contingent deferred sales charges are earned on redemptions of class b shares within six years of purchase and on redemptions of class c shares within one year of purchase 
contingent deferred sales charges fluctuate primarily based on the length of the investment in class b and class c shares 
waivers of contingent deferred sales charges apply under certain circumstances 
other revenues other revenues consist primarily of portfolio accounting fees  which are contractual payments calculated as a percentage of combined assets of the mutual funds for financial accounting services  such as expense accrual and tax calculations 
for the year ended december   we received million in portfolio accounting fees 
the fees were calculated based on the average daily assets of the open end and closed end funds 
operating expenses our operating expenses  which consist of employee compensation and benefits  distribution and underwriting expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses  may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  changes in distribution and underwriting expense as a result of fluctuations in mutual fund sales  level of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management  the amount of rule b distribution and or service fees that we receive  as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future  which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees  changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to further penetrate our existing distribution channels  and expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  depreciation  amortization  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure 
employee compensation and benefits our largest operating expense is employee compensation and benefits expense  which includes salaries  deferred and incentive compensation and related benefits costs 
employee compensation and benefits are benchmarked against industry compensation standards 
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel  we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefits 
we expect to experience a general rise in employee compensation and benefits expenses over time 
we use a fair value method in recording compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options granted under our incentive stock plans 
under the fair value method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
fair value is determined on the date granted using the black scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of the underlying stock for restricted stock units 
distribution and underwriting expense distribution and underwriting expense includes payments that we make to broker dealers and other intermediaries for selling  underwriting  servicing and administering mutual funds 
this expense is influenced by new mutual funds sales  levels of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management in these products 
with respect to open end funds  this expense is comprised of rule b distribution and or service fee payments to the selling firms 
amortization of deferred sales commissions as discussed above  we pay commissions to selling firms upon the sale of class b and c shares of open end funds 
as we pay these commissions  we create a deferred sales commission asset on our balance sheet 
we amortize this asset over the period in which we receive related asset based distribution and or service fees pursuant to rule b plans 
amortization expenses generally offset the rule b fees we receive from the funds shareholders over this same period 
in addition  because rule b fees cease upon the redemption of open end fund shares  amortization expenses are accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in a reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
marketing and sales promotion expenses generally vary based on the type and level of marketing  educational  sales or other programs in operation and include closed end fund marketing costs and ongoing and one time payments to broker dealers 
in addition  as the open end mutual funds that we manage have grown in size and recognition  we have become subject to supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents  which are a component of marketing and sales promotion expense 
we expect supplemental compensation payments to continue to increase to the extent our funds gain assets and further recognition 
in connection with closed end funds  we make fee payments to certain underwriters for distribution  consulting and or support services rendered during or after the offering period of each closed end fund 
these fees are based on contractual agreements with underwriting firms and are either paid over time based on the average daily net assets of such funds or are paid at the close of the offering period based on the amount of assets raised during the offering 
general and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy related costs  depreciation and professional and business services and generally increase and decrease in relative proportion to the number of employees retained by us and the overall size and scale of our business operations 
impact of distribution and underwriting activities in order to gather assets under management  we engage in distribution and underwriting activities  principally with respect to our family of open end mutual funds 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we present distribution fees earned by us as revenues and distribution fees paid to selling firms and the amortization of deferred sales commissions as expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  when analyzing our business  we net the result of these distribution activities as they are typically a result of a single open end mutual fund share purchase 
hence  the result of presenting this information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is a reduction to our overall operating margin  as the margin on distribution activities is generally lower than the margins on the remainder of our business 
the following table summarizes the net distribution fee margin for the years ended december  and distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions net distribution fees net distribution fee margin net distribution fee margin varies by share class because each share class has different distribution and underwriting activities  which are described below 
class a shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares provide for a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
the sales charge is equal to a maximum of of the amount invested 
we retain an underwriting fee representing a portion of this sales charge and pay any remaining amounts to the selling firm 
we retained underwriting fees of million for the year ended december  we receive rule b distribution and service fees on class a shares at a rate of of class a share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class a share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class a share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the distribution fee margin that we earn on class a shares is largely driven by the distribution fees that we retain as broker of record and by the front end sales charges  which fluctuate with both the total class a share sales and the mix of class a share sales with and without a sales charge 
recently  the percentage of class a share sales made without a sales charge has been increasing 
if this trend continues  we expect that our class a share net distribution fee margin will decrease 
class b shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  investors in class b shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advance payment is capitalized when paid as a deferred sales commission asset and is amortized straight line over eight years 
for the year ended december   we made class b share commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems shares within the first six years of investment  we receive a contingent deferred sales charge  often referred to as a cdsc  of between during the first year declining to during the sixth year of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class b share cdsc payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class b shares at the rate of of class b share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make rule b service fee payments to the selling firm at a rate of of class b share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
we retain a distribution fee to help us recover the upfront commissions that we paid to the selling firm 
rule b payments continue for eight years  at which point class b shares automatically convert into class a shares 
for the year ended december   we received class b share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class b share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the net distribution fee margin that we earn on class b shares is primarily the result of the difference between the annual distribution fee revenue that we receive on the average class b share assets under management and the amortization of the upfront commission over the eight year life of the asset 
this differential creates a component of net distribution fee margin unique to class b shares that will remain constant before giving consideration to market appreciation or depreciation 
further  the net distribution fee margin on class b shares fluctuates due to the appreciation or depreciation of the underlying assets 
appreciation or depreciation of the assets from the time of sale will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the distribution fee revenues 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class b share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate 
class c shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  investors in class c shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advance payment is capitalized when paid as a deferred sales commission asset and is amortized straight line over months 
for the year ended december   we made commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems class c shares within one year of investment  we receive from the proceeds of the sale a cdsc equal to of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class c share cdsc payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class c shares at the rate of of class c share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make class c share rule b distribution and service fee payments to the selling firm beginning in the second year following the sale at the rate of of class c share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class c share b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class c share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the first year s rule b fee helps us to recoup the upfront commission we paid to the selling firm  resulting in a net distribution fee margin on class c shares that is generally zero  before giving consideration to market appreciation or depreciation 
however  during the first months following the sale of class c shares  this margin will fluctuate due to the appreciation or depreciation of class c share assets 
appreciation or depreciation of the assets from the time of sale will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the distribution fee revenues 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class c share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate 
class i shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
class r shares were added in march investors do not pay a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
we receive rule b fees on class r shares at a rate of of class r share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make class r share rule b distribution and service fee payments to selling firms equal to the distribution and service fee revenue that we receive and record these payments as distribution expense 
because the distribution revenue and distribution expense on class r shares generally offset  the net distribution fee margin is zero for this share class  and as a result negatively impacts the overall net distribution margin 
because the net distribution fee margin varies by share class  the mix of class a  class b and class c share sales and assets affects the net overall distribution fee margin  because the class a share margin is significantly greater than the class b and class c margins 
finally  we expect that our net distribution fee margin will continue to negatively impact our operating margins 
other income expense  net other income expense  net represents net investment gains or losses from a portion of our investment portfolio and from the limited partnerships that we consolidate  net of minority interest in those partnerships  as well as dividends and net interest income or expense 
historically  other income expense  net has not been a material portion of our pre tax earnings 
however  as we continue to invest a significant portion of our operating cash inflow into income generating securities  we expect that the impact of other income expense  net will continue to be more significant in future periods

minority interest as sole manager of calamos holdings llc  we consolidate the financial results of calamos holdings llc with ours 
in light of calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s collective ownership of approximately in calamos holdings llc as of december  and  respectively  we reflect their ownership as a minority interest in our consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of operations 
our historical results are those of calamos family partners  inc  as our predecessor company 
as a result  our income before income taxes  excluding calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s minority interest  represent approximately of calamos holdings llc s net income for the years ended december  and  and similarly  outstanding shares of our class a common stock represent approximately of the outstanding membership units of calamos holdings llc for the years ended december  and beginning in  income before minority interest in calamos holdings llc and income taxes includes investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents held solely by calamos asset management  inc cam during the same period 
this investment income is not reduced by any minority interest  therefore  the resulting minority interest is less than for the years ended december  and we expect that as we continue to generate and invest cash held solely by cam the minority interest will continue to decline as a percentage of income before minority interest in calamos holdings llc and income taxes 
calamos partners llc is the general partner of calamos equity opportunities fund lp  a private investment partnership  and at december   we and our affiliates had and interests in this partnership  respectively combined 
as of december   we and our affiliates had and interests in this partnership  respectively combined 
during and  we consolidated the financial results of this partnership into our results 
the combined interests of the investments in the partnership not owned by us are presented as minority interest in partnership investments in our financial statements 
as partnerships are created to launch new products  we as well as our affiliates may invest in these entities  and these partnerships may be required to be consolidated into our results as well 
income taxes calamos family partners  inc  as predecessor  was taxed as an s corporation under the internal revenue code  therefore  the income and expenses of calamos family partners  inc were included in the income tax returns of its stockholders 
calamos family partners  inc was subject only to illinois replacement tax and other state taxes  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
beginning november   we have been subject to income taxes applicable to c corporations 
we have determined our effective tax rate to be and for the years ended december  and  respectively  and for the period november  through december  dilutive effect of issuance of new shares of class a common stock when we issue new shares of class a common stock  including upon the exercise or conversion of options or restricted stock units granted pursuant to our incentive compensation plan  our existing class a common stockholders will experience dilution with regard to their indirect ownership interest in the equity of calamos holdings llc 
in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated limited liability company agreement pursuant to which calamos holdings llc is governed  the net cash proceeds received by us from any future issuance of shares of class a common stock  including upon the exercise or conversion of options or restricted stock units granted under our incentive compensation plan  will be concurrently transferred to calamos holdings llc in exchange for newly issued membership units equal in number to such number of shares of class a common stock issued by us 
the number of outstanding membership units owned by us will  therefore  equal the number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock at all times 
as a result  the amount of dilution that existing class a common stockholders will experience with regard to their equity interest in calamos holdings llc resulting from the issuance of additional shares of our class a common stock will not be adversely affected by our holding company structure 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  assets under management assets under management increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the average assets under management reached billion for the six months ended june  and fell to billion for the six months ended december  at december   our assets under management consisted of mutual funds and separate accounts  as compared to mutual funds and separate accounts at december  year ended december  change in millions amount percent mutual funds beginning assets under management net purchases market appreciation ending assets under management average assets under management separate accounts beginning assets under management net purchases redemptions market appreciation ending assets under management average assets under management total assets under management beginning assets under management net purchases redemptions market appreciation ending assets under management average assets under management mutual fund net purchases were million in  a decrease of billion from billion in the prior year 
mutual fund net purchases were billion for the six months ended june  during the six months ended december   we experienced net redemptions of approximately billion 
the outflows during the last half of were primarily due to lower purchases and higher redemptions of our growth fund  which comprises a significant percentage of our total assets under management 
as is consistent with the broad market  growth equities were largely out of favor with investors during  which along with the short term underperformance of our growth fund  negatively affected both market appreciation and net purchases redemptions 
however  during  we experienced net purchases in a number of our mutual funds  primarily our market neutral income fund  growth and income fund  global growth and income fund and international growth fund 
separate accounts had net redemptions of billion in compared to net purchases of million in  mainly due to separate account outflows in our convertible strategies  which remain closed to new investors 
separate account net purchases were relatively flat for the six months ended june   while during the six months ended december   we experienced net redemptions of approximately billion 
revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues compared to the prior year  investment management fees increased in primarily due to a billion increase in average assets under management 
the overall growth in investment management fees was due primarily to an increase in fees from mutual funds  which increased to million in from million in the prior year 
open end fund investment management fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily due to increases in open end fund average assets under management of billion for compared to the prior year 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts increased to million from million primarily due to an approximate million increase in average assets under management 
investment management fees  in total  as a percentage of assets under management were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
distribution and underwriting fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  primarily due to increases in open end fund average assets under management of billion for compared to the prior year 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this increase was mostly due to higher distribution and underwriting  employee compensation and benefits  and general and administrative expenses 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense increased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the increase largely reflects the impact of expanding our institutional sales force  internalizing our mutual fund client services function and growing our information technology and administrative staff to support our growth 
we expect that the level of overall employee compensation and benefits expense will increase in future periods due to changes in staffing levels to support the growth and expansion of our business  including adding staff to properly support our current client base 
current compensation expense levels are also expected to increase due to merit increases for our existing staff but may vary due to compensation based on our performance 
distribution and underwriting expense increased by million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase of million resulting from the growth in the class c share assets older than one year and to an increase of million resulting from the growth of class a and class b open end fund average assets under management 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay 
however  class c share assets do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years  as we pay the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to vary with the change in open end mutual fund assets under management 
marketing and sales promotion expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year period 
these expenses increased by million in  when compared to  generally due to an increase in supplemental compensation payments 
the increase in supplemental compensation payments is largely attributable to the billion increase in average mutual fund assets under management 
we expect that supplemental compensation payments will fluctuate with changes in mutual fund purchases and assets under management 
general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period primarily due to increases of million in depreciation expense  million in occupancy related costs and million in travel and entertainment costs for those same periods 
the increases in depreciation expense and occupancy costs were primarily due to the full year impact of occupying our new headquarters and depreciating new assets placed in service in our facilities 
the increases in travel and entertainment expenses were primarily due to our expanded sales efforts 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and other income expense  net other income expense  net was a net income of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net income of million for the prior year 
in thousands change net interest income expense investment and other income minority interest in partnership investments total other income expense  net the change in net interest income expense of million for the year ended december  was due to an increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents  as interest expense was million for both the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in investment and other income of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to a million decrease in market appreciation resulting principally from market fluctuations of our consolidated partnerships 
minority interest in partnership investments represents the minority interests portion of the market appreciation from our consolidated partnerships while the year over year change corresponds with the decrease in market appreciation of the consolidated partnership investments 
the unrealized gains and losses on a significant portion of our investment securities are not recorded as changes in net income  rather  these unrealized gains and losses are recognized as changes to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
these unrealized gains and losses are only recognized in our consolidated statements of operations when they are realized  which occurs upon the sale of the securities and upon the receipt of capital gains distributions  which typically occur during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
for the years ended december  and  net unrealized gains were generated by our investment securities of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  net of minority interest and taxes  respectively  were recognized as increases to accumulated other comprehensive income 
net income our net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  when compared to the previous year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  prior to our initial public offering of class a common stock  our business was conducted by calamos family partners  inc  wholly owned by members of the calamos family and calamos family trusts 
in october  calamos family partners  inc established calamos holdings llc to be the direct owner and operator of its business 
on november   we closed our initial public offering of class a common stock and used some of the proceeds to acquire membership units in calamos holdings llc 
in connection with our initial acquisition of membership units  we became the sole manager of calamos holdings llc and began conducting the business previously conducted by calamos family partners  inc accordingly  the results for the periods from january  through november  presented below reflect the operations for calamos family partners  inc and its subsidiaries predecessor 
results for the periods from november  through december  reflect the results of operations for calamos asset management  inc we believe that the pro forma combined results for the twelve months ending december  provide a more meaningful basis for period to period comparisons of our results 
therefore  we have combined the periods in the following table november to january to pro forma december  november  combined in thousands  except share data predecessor revenues investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits distribution and underwriting expenses amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total expenses operating income other income expense net interest income expense investment income and other income minority interest in partnership investments total other income expense  net income before minority interest in calamos holdings llc and income taxes minority interest in calamos holdings llc income before income taxes income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic diluted assets under management assets under management increased by billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  at december   our assets under management consisted of mutual funds and separate accounts  as compared to mutual funds and separate accounts at december  year ended december  change in millions amount percent mutual funds beginning assets under management net purchases market appreciation ending assets under management average assets under management separate accounts beginning assets under management net purchases market appreciation ending assets under management average assets under management total assets under management beginning assets under management net purchases market appreciation ending assets under management average assets under management mutual fund net purchases were billion in compared to billion in the prior year 
the decrease in mutual fund net purchases was primarily attributable to a billion closed end fund offering during that did not recur and to a billion increase in redemptions  which have increased with the growth in assets under management 
because closed end funds do not continually offer new shares to investors  net purchases of closed end funds are entirely dependent on our ability to consummate closed end fund offerings 
market demand for closed end fund offerings is difficult to predict 
we intend to monitor the market and pursue opportunities as they present themselves and when doing so would be consistent with our business strategy 
for example  we launched the calamos global total return fund in the fourth quarter of and raised approximately million in assets under management 
separate accounts net purchases decreased by million in from million in  largely driven by managed account outflows in our convertible strategies  which remain closed to new investors 
revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues compared to the prior year  investment management fees increased in primarily due to a billion increase in average assets under management 
the overall growth in investment management fees was due primarily to an increase in fees from mutual funds  which increased to million in from million in the prior year 
open end fund investment management fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily due to increases in open end fund average assets under management of billion for compared to the prior year 
closed end fund investment management fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year as a result of increases in closed end fund average assets under management of billion in when compared to the prior year 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts increased to million from million  driven by the shift to equity strategies within these accounts and by the increase in average assets under management 
investment management fees  in total  as a percentage of assets under management were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing the continued shift of assets from our convertible strategies to our equity strategies  which generally carry higher fees 
distribution and underwriting fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  primarily due to increases in open end fund average assets under management of billion for compared to the prior year

this increase was mostly due to higher distribution and underwriting expense 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year  largely resulting from the decrease of million in expense attributable to our equity compensation 
the decrease in equity compensation expense was primarily driven by the conversion of liability based compensation programs that fluctuated with the enterprise value to our equity based programs that are accounted for using fair value provisions that are fixed at the date of grant 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in incentive based compensation as a result of our performance 
we do not anticipate large fluctuations in our equity compensation expense in the future  except as it relates to new award issuances  however  we expect the level of overall employee compensation and benefits expense will increase in future periods due to changes in staffing levels to support the growth and expansion of our business 
current compensation expense levels are also expected to increase due to merit increases for our existing staff but may vary due to compensation based on our performance 
distribution and underwriting expense increased by million to million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase of million resulting from the growth in the class c share assets older than one year and due to an increase of million resulting from the growth of average open end fund assets under management 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay  but they do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years as we pay the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates that we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to increase to the extent our open end mutual fund assets under management continue to grow 
marketing and sales promotion expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  primarily due to a million one time fee paid to underwriters of a closed end fund offering that we incurred during  partially offset by increases in supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents 
as open end mutual funds that we manage have grown in size and recognition  we have become subject to supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents 
we expect supplemental compensation payments to continue to increase to the extent our funds gain assets and further recognition 
general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
we began making lease payments on our new headquarters in april in addition to making lease payments and other occupancy related payments on our two other office facilities  which increased occupancy costs by million for the year ended december  maintaining two headquarters for the second and third quarters resulted in duplicative rent and non recurring expenses of approximately million 
additionally  for the year ended december   professional services expense increased million and depreciation expense increased million  respectively 
the increases in professional services expense were primarily due to incremental costs incurred as a public company  including sarbanes oxley compliance costs and higher fees related to legal and compliance  audit services and tax preparation 
the increases in depreciation expense were primarily due to the depreciation of new leasehold improvements in connection with the move to our new headquarters  while million of the increase in depreciation expense for was due to the shortening of depreciable lives of leasehold improvements in our previous headquarters caused by the move into our new headquarters 
because our move occurred in the last half of the year  we expect that our depreciation expense in the future will increase to reflect the full year benefit provided by our new improvements

liquidity and capital resources our current financial condition is highly liquid  with the majority of our assets representing our corporate investment portfolio  which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and partnership investments 
we anticipate utilizing our cash and cash equivalent balances to make investments in our products as opportunities arise  to invest in property and equipment for our facility  to support our operations and to acquire shares under our share repurchase program 
investment securities are principally comprised of company sponsored mutual funds 
in addition  the underlying partnership investments are typically comprised of highly liquid exchange traded securities

other long term obligations principally represent commitments under equity compensation agreements 
these obligations are included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commissions deferred sales commissions are commissions advanced by us on our sale of class b and class c shares of open end funds 
deferred sales commissions are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which b fees are received 
because b fees cease upon redemption of shares  amortization expense is accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in the reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
these redemptions result in an amortization period not to exceed months for class c shares and months eight years for class b shares 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commissions for impairment purposes on a quarterly basis 
significant assumptions utilized by us to estimate future average assets under management include expected future market performance and redemption rates 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions 
market performance assumptions are selected using expected average market returns based on long term market index benchmarks for each asset class held within the fund 
at december   we used average market return assumptions ranging from to based on asset class 
higher actual average market returns would increase undiscounted cash flows  while lower actual average market returns would decrease undiscounted future cash flows 
future redemption assumptions were determined by using the actual redemption rates that each fund experienced over the prior month period 
for class b shares and class c shares  we used average historical redemption rates of between and  respectively  at december  an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease the undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated quarterly  or monthly when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
if we determine that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in the statement of operations as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
as of each reporting period presented  we determined that no impairment of the deferred commission asset existed  but due to the volatility of the capital markets and the changes in redemption rates  we are unable to predict whether or when future impairment of the deferred sales commission asset might occur 
compensation plans on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires us to recognize the cost of stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas effective january  and elected to recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value 
the provisions of sfas r are similar  but not identical  to the fair value recognition that we have used since the beginning of the effects of this change do not have a material impact on our financial statements 
during  we established an incentive stock plan that provides for grants of restricted stock unit awards  or rsus  and stock option awards for certain employees 
rsus are convertible on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock 
stock option awards are based on shares of our common stock 
we estimate the fair value of the options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
further  we estimate the number of forfeited awards at the grant date 
actual forfeitures may vary from our assumptions  which will result in modifications to future expenses 
the eau plan was terminated in october in connection with our initial public offering 
prior to its termination  compensation expense was accrued over the periods in which employees performed services 
as such  changes in the aggregate unit value  multiplied by the ratio of actual to total number of service periods in the vesting period  were recorded as an increase or decrease to expense in the current period 
the value of the eau at the valuation date was derived from an equally weighted calculation based on multiples of assets under management  revenue and ebitda  defined as net income plus interest expense  income taxes and fixed asset depreciation  excluding amortization of deferred sales commissions 
we used industry multiples provided by independent third party sources in computing the values  until the termination of the plan at which time we used our initial public offering price 
income taxes management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating principally to our step up in tax basis to fair market value for our intangible assets under our election to be made under section of the internal revenue code 
in the event that sufficient taxable income does not result in future years  among other things  a valuation allowance for some or all of our deferred tax assets would be required 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which seeks to reduce diversity in practice that is associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition when accounting for uncertain tax positions and clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin is effective for us beginning january  we have evaluated the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements and do not expect it to be material 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosure regarding fair value measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisors for the mutual funds and separate accounts we manage 
a significant majority of our operating revenue  approximately for the year ended december   is derived from investment advisory  distribution and portfolio accounting agreements with the mutual funds and separate accounts 
under these agreements  the fees we receive are typically based on the market value of the assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease or by causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
in addition  a decline in the prices of securities may present market conditions that could preclude us from increasing assets under management and prevent us from realizing higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the prices of investment securities 
we own investment securities primarily comprised of mutual funds we manage 
at december   the fair value of these investment securities was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the value of these investments  the fair value would increase or decrease by million at december  additionally  we are subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of our partnership investments  which consist primarily of marketable securities 
as a result  the market values of these partnerships are subject to the same fluctuations as our investment securities 
at december   the fair value of these partnerships was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the value of these partnerships  the fair value would increase or decrease by million at december  on april   we issued million of senior unsecured notes due april  to various note purchasers in a private placement 
these notes have a fixed interest rate of  and consequently  we do not believe that these notes have any interest rate risk 
due to the nature of our business  we believe that we do not face any material credit risk  inflation  interest rate or foreign currency rate risk
