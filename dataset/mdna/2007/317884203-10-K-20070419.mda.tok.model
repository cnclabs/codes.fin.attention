executive overview our business we are one of the leading retailers of fine jewelry in the united states and primarily operate licensed fine jewelry departments in major department stores where we sell a broad selection of moderately priced jewelry  with an average sales price of approximately per item 
we also operate stand alone jewelry stores which sell luxury priced jewelry  with an average sales price of approximately  per item 
we have two operating segments department store based fine jewelry departments and stand alone jewelry stores 
as of february   we operated a total of locations  including department store based fine jewelry departments in eleven host store groups  in states and the district of columbia  as well as carlyle specialty jewelry stores in nine states  located principally in the southeastern united states and five congress specialty jewelry stores in southwest florida 
our primary focus is to offer desirable and competitively priced products  a breadth of merchandise assortments and to provide superior customer service 
our ability to quickly identify emerging trends and maintain strong relationships with vendors has enabled us to present better assortments in our showcases 
with respect to our department store based fine jewelry departments  we believe that we are an important contributor to each of our host store groups and we continue to seek opportunities to penetrate the department store segment 
by outsourcing their fine jewelry departments to us  host store groups gain our expertise in merchandising  selling and marketing jewelry and customer service 
additionally  by avoiding high working capital investments typically required of the traditional retail jewelry business  host stores improve their return on investment and increase their profitability 
as a licensee  we benefit from the host stores reputation  cust omer traffic  credit services and established customer base 
we also avoid the substantial capital investment in fixed assets typical of a stand alone retail format 
at the end of  approximately of our merchandise was held on consignment  which reduces our inventory exposure to changing fashion trends 
these factors have generally led our new departments to achieve profitability within the first twelve months of operation 
our stand alone jewelry stores offer compelling shopping environments for the high end luxury consumer and focus on watches  gold  designer jewelry  diamonds and precious gemstones  complemented by an assortment of giftware 
our stand alone jewelry stores each strive to provide their customers with a premier shopping experience by utilizing knowledgeable  professional and well trained sales associates  marketing programs designed to promote customer awareness of their merchandise assortments and by extending credit to their customers through their credit card programs which are managed by a third party 
we measure ourselves against key financial measures that we believe provide a well balanced perspective regarding our overall financial success 
those benchmarks are as follows  together with how they are computed

diluted earnings per share eps net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding and share equivalents included to the extent they are dilutive which is an indicator of the returns generated for our shareholders

comparable store sales growth computed as the percentage change in sales for locations open for the same months during the comparable periods 
comparable store sales are measured against our host store groups as well as other jewelry retailers  
spacer

spacer

spacer

total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change which indicates  among other things  the success of our selection of new store locations and the effectiveness of our merchandising strategies  and 
spacer

operating margin rate income from operations divided by net sales which is an indicator of our success in leveraging our fixed costs and managing our variable costs 
key components of income from operations which management focuses on include monitoring gross margin levels as well as continued emphasis on leveraging our sg a 
highlights during  we achieved a growth in comparable store sales 
over the past decade  through the successful execution of our marketing and merchandising strategy  we have experienced comparable store sales increases in nine out of ten years and we have consistently outperformed our host store groups with respect to these increases 
we have an experienced management team  a well trained and highly motivated sales force  an expert jewelry merchandising team  unique vendor relationships and an established customer base 
our merchandising and inventory control systems and point of sale systems for our locations provide us with a foundation for solid productivity 
total sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of 
total sales for included million of sales generated by our stand alone jewelry stores compared to million in which includes sales from the date of acquisition of carlyle in may and of congress in november 
gross margin increased by million in compared to  and  as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased by from to primarily due to the increase in the lifo provision as a result of increases in our internal price indices  as well as the increased price of gold and as a result of the discontinued business  lower vendor concessions 
although sg a increased by million  as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased from to  due to lower advertising and license and lease fees as well as corporate office cost savings 
during  we continued to effectively manage our inventories and implement appropriate expense controls 
we ended with million of cash and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement of million  compared to million of cash at the end of this decrease in cash and increase in borrowings was attributable to the approximately million impact of the congress acquisition including debt assumed  as well as the approximately million impact as a result of the retirement of the gold consignment agreement 
in december  finlay jewelry s revolving credit agreement was amended to  among other things  extend the maturity date to january  allow for a facilities increase of up to million in the aggregate  eliminate the yearly outstanding balance reduction requirement  eliminate all of the financial covenants except for the requirement to maintain a certain fixed charge ratio at certain times  and allow us to engage in business acquisitions of a certain size without obtaining prior approval of the lenders 
the revolving credit agreement continues to contain customary covenants relating to  among others  capital expenditures  management compensation and the payment of dividends 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
maximum outstanding borrowings during peaked at million  at which point the available borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were an additional million 
effective as of november   finlay jewelry entered into an agreement to terminate and retire its obligation under the gold consignment agreement  which was an off balance sheet arrangement 
in accordance with the termination agreement  finlay jewelry paid approximately million to purchase the outstanding gold 
the purchased gold is reflected as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets from the date of purchase 
payment of the million gold purchase price was financed through additional borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
opportunities we believe that current trends in jewelry retailing provide a significant opportunity for our growth 
consumers spent approximately billion on jewelry including both fine jewelry and costume jewelry in the united states in calendar year  an increase of approximately billion over  according to the united states department of commerce 
in the department store and specialty jewelry store sectors in which we operate  consumers spent an estimated billion on fine jewelry in our management believes that demographic factors such as the maturing us population and an increase in the number of working women  have resulted in greater disposable income  thus contributing to the growth of the fine jewelry retailing industry 
our management also believes that jewelry consumers today increasingly perceive fine jewelry as a fashion accessory  resulting in purchases which augment our gift and special occasion sales 
in november  finlay jewelry signed new agreements with federated for the macy s midwest and macy s north divisions and amended the existing macy s northwest and macy s south agreements  effective at the beginning of the agreements expire on january   and cover approximately departments in total 
in addition to extending the agreements for three years  all non compete provisions from the previous may contracts that required finlay jewelry to obtain may s permission before opening a new department or store within a certain radius of a may store were eliminated 
we believe that the elimination of this non compete provision provides finlay jewelry with significantly greater opportunity to expand its business and continue to diversify beyond the traditional department store sector 
the agreement has no impact on the bloomingdale s division whose license agreement  covering departments  curre ntly runs through january  additional growth opportunities exist with respect to opening departments within existing host stores that do not currently operate jewelry departments 
for example  over the past three years  we have added departments in dillard s 
during  we opened departments within dillard s and we plan to add three departments in moreover  we opened seven departments with federated during  including two bloomingdale s stores 
further  we opened two new carlyle stores in and we project opening one new carlyle store in through opening new bloomingdale s departments  as well as new stand alone stores  we will have a larger portion of our business dedicated to the high end luxury sector 
an important initiative and focus of management is developing opportunities for our growth 
we consider it a high priority to identify new businesses that offer growth  financial viability and manageability and will have a positive impact on shareholder value 
we will continue to seek to identify complementary businesses to leverage our core competencies in the jewelry industry and plan to continue to pursue the following key initiatives to further increase sales and earnings

host store consolidation 
as of february   we operated a total of departments in five of federated s eight divisions  which excludes departments either divested or phased into the macy s east or macy s west divisions during the first half of in  we generated sales of approximately million from these departments

during  we recorded charges of million related to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and severance for our field operations with respect to these departments 
during  approximately of our sales were generated by departments operated in store groups owned by federated excluding the federated departments that closed in and lord taylor 
a decision by federated or certain of our other host store groups to terminate our existing relationships  to assume the operation of departments themselves  or to close a significant number of stores would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in may  the company announced that belk would not renew finlay jewelry s license agreement due to belk s acquisition of a privately held company that currently licenses fine jewelry departments in certain of the belk stores 
the termination of the license agreement  effective at the end of  resulted in the closure of departments

our primary capital requirements are funding working capital for new locations and growth of existing locations  as well as debt service obligations and license fees to host store groups  rent payments for the stand alone jewelry stores  funding potential acquisitions  and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for opening new locations  renovating existing locations and information technology investments 
for and  capital expenditures totaled million and million  respectively  exclusive of fixed assets acquired 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to million 
although capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement  to date  this limitation has not precluded us from satisfying our capital expenditure requirements 
we currently expect to fund capital expenditure requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of cash  internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
we believe that our internally generated liquidity through cash flows from operations  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans and will provide adequate financing flexibility 
cash flows provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended february   january  and january  were as follows

our current priorities for the use of cash or borrowings  as a result of borrowings available under the revolving credit agreement  are

investments in technology 
operating activities the primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operating activities 
the key component of operating cash flow is merchandise sales 
operating cash outflows include payments to vendors for inventory  services and supplies  payments for employee payroll  license fees  rent and payments of interest and taxes 
net cash flows used in operations were million in accounts receivable decreased to million from million primarily due to the impact of payments collected under the deferred billing program that we had last year with may  whereby we receive settlement for certain sales over a twelve month period 
the net impact of the termination and retirement of the gold consignment agreement on our consolidated balance sheet was an increase to owned inventory of approximately million  a reduction to other receivables of million for the advances made to the gold vendors for the cost of the non gold portion of the gold consignment merchandise and an increase in the borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million  which was used to pay the obligation to the gold consignor 
the gold consignment agreement was previously an off balance sheet arrangement 
additionally  accounts payable decreased to million from million as a result of lower receipts and lower sales of consignment merchandise in the fourth quarter of as compared to our principal operations involving licensed fine jewelry departments substantially preclude customer receivables as our license agreements typically require host stores to remit sales proceeds for each month without regard to whether such sales were cash  store credit or national credit card to us approximately three weeks after the end of such month 
additionally  at the end of  approximately of our merchandise was held on consignment 
our working capital balance was million at february   an increase of million from january  the seasonality of our business causes working capital requirements  and therefore  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  to reach their highest level in the months of october  november and december in anticipation of the year end holiday season 
accordingly  we experience seasonal cash needs as inventory levels peak 
additionally  substantially all of our license agreements provide for accelerated payments during the months of november and december  which require the host store groups to remit to us of the estimated months sales prior to or shortly following the end of that month 
these proceeds result in a significant increase in our cash  which is used to reduce our borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
inventory levels increased by million as compared to january   primarily as a result of the conversion of the majority of finlay jewelry s gold consignment inventory to owned inventory due to the retirement of the gold consignment agreement as well as the acquisition of congress  whose inventory levels were million as of february  investing activities for  net cash used in investing activities totaled million and consisted of the acquisition of congress in november  which accounted for million of cash invested as well as payments for capital expenditures 
for and  net cash used in investing activities totaled million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in  and related primarily to expenditures for opening new locations and renovating existing locations 
included in was the use of cash of million associated with the acquisition of carlyle 
financing activities proceeds from  and principal repayments on  the revolving credit facility have been our primary financing activities 
net cash from financing activities was million in consisting of the outstanding borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility offset by the paydown of congress revolving credit facility of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  consisting principally of the paydown of carlyle s revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit agreement provides us with a line of credit of up to million to finance working capital needs 
in december  the revolving credit agreement was amended to  among other things  extend the maturity date to january  allow for a facilities increase of up to million in the aggregate  eliminate the yearly outstanding balance reduction requirement  eliminate all of the financial covenants except for the requirement to maintain a certain fixed charge ratio at certain times  and allow us to engage in business acquisitions of a certain size without obtaining prior approval of the lenders 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  i the prime rate plus a margin ranging from zero to or ii the adjusted eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to  in each case depending on availability under our facility 
the weighted average in terest rate was and for and  respectively 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at february  were million 
the average amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement during and were million and million  respectively 
the maximum amount outstanding during was million  at which point the available borrowings were an additional million 
we intend to increase the size of the facility in as a result of the conversion of the gold merchandise to owned inventory  resulting in a larger collateral base 
at february  and january   we had letters of credit outstanding totaling million and million  respectively  which guarantee various trade activities 
in may  finlay jewelry completed the acquisition of carlyle 
the purchase price was approximately million plus transaction fees  and was financed with additional borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the acquisition  carlyle s revolving credit facility totaling million was terminated and paid in full at the closing 
since the date of the acquisition  carlyle s cash requirements have been  and will continue to be  funded under the revolving credit agreement 
in november  finlay jewelry completed the acquisition of congress 
at the time of the stock purchase  congress was a privately owned regional chain of five jewelry stores located in southwest florida  with a focus on the luxury market 
the purchase price was million plus transaction fees  and was financed with additional borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
congress revolving credit facility totaling million was terminated and paid in full at the closing 
since the date of acquisition  congress cash requirements have been  and will continue to be  funded under the revolving credit agreement 
congress annual sales for were approximately million 
a significant amount of our operating cash flow will be used to pay interest with respect to the senior notes and amounts due under the revolving credit agreement 
as of february   our outstanding borrowings were million  which included a million balance under the senior notes and million balance under the revolving credit agreement 
the agreements covering the revolving credit agreement and the senior notes each require that finlay jewelry comply with certain covenants 
finlay jewelry was in compliance with its covenants at february  because compliance is based  in part  on our management s estimates and actual results can differ from those estimates  there can be no assurance that finlay jewelry will be in compliance with the covenants in the future or that the lenders will waive or amend any of the covenants should finlay jewelry be in violation thereof 
however  we do believe the assumptions used are appropriate 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary covenants  including limitations on  or relating to  capital expenditures  liens  indebtedness  investments  mergers  acquisitions  affiliate transactions  management compensation and the payment of dividends and other restricted payments 
the indenture related to the senior notes contains restrictions relating to  among other things  the payment of dividends  redemptions or repurchases of capital stock  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the making of certain investments  the creation of certain liens  the sale of certain assets  entering into transactions with affiliates  engaging in mergers and consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all assets 
refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  based upon current operations  anticipated growth and continued availability under the revolving credit agreement  finlay jewelry will  for the foreseeable future  be able to meet its debt service and anticipated working capital obligations and to make distributions sufficient to permit us to pay certain expenses as they come due 
no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry to meet its debt service and other obligations 
the amounts required to satisfy the aggregate of finlay jewelry s interest expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our long term needs for external financing will depend on our rate of growth  the level of internally generated funds and the ability to continue obtaining substantial amounts of merchandise on advantageous terms  including consignment arrangements with our vendors 
at february  and january   million and million  respectively  of consignment merchandise from approximately vendors was on hand 
the decrease is primarily associated with the termination of the gold consignment agreement and the conversion of this merchandise to owned inventory 
for  we had an average balance of consignment merchandise of million as compared to an average balance of million in the following table summarizes our contractual and commercial obligations which may have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources  as of february  dollars in thousands

the average amount outstanding during was million and the outstanding balance as of april  was million 
refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
represents a special bonus for four senior executives equal to of the executives salary if employed by the company on the dates specified in the respective employment agreements 
the operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which amounted to approximately million for  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance and taxes 
our open purchase orders are cancelable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
there were no commercial commitments outstanding as of february  other than as disclosed in the table above  nor have we provided any third party financial guarantees as of and for the year ended february  effective as of november   finlay jewelry entered into an agreement to terminate and retire its obligation under the gold consignment agreement  which was an off balance sheet arrangement 
in accordance with the termination agreement  finlay jewelry paid approximately million to purchase the outstanding gold 
the purchased gold is reflected as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets from the date of purchase 
payment of the million gold purchase price was financed through additional borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
finlay jewelry considered many factors when evaluating whether to terminate the gold consignment agreement  including the volatility of gold prices in recent years and the belief that finlay jewelry can better manage gross margins under an owned inventory program working directly with its vendors 
in addition  the termination simplifies finlay jewelry s capital structure by eliminating an off balance sheet contractual obligation 
with the retirement of its obligation  finlay jewelry converted the majority of its gold consignment inventory to owned inventory on finlay jewelry s consolidated balance sheets and eliminated the other receivables  representing cash advances to certain vendors for the cost of the non gold portion of the gold consignment merchandise 
we have not created  and are not party to  any off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources

the employment agreement has a term ending on january   unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the employment agreement 
the agreement provides an annual salary level of approximately million as well as cash incentive compensation based on meeting specific financial goals 
in june  we entered into employment agreements with three senior executives of finlay jewelry and  in march  we entered into an employment agreement with a fourth senior executive of finlay jewelry 
each of the agreements has a term of three years  unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the employment agreements 
the agreements provide for minimum annual salary levels totaling approximately million  incentive compensation based on meeting specific financial goals and a special bonus equal to of each executives salary if  in the case of the june agreements  the executive is employed by finlay jewelry on june   and  in the case of the march agreement  if the executive is employed by finlay jewelry on february  the purchase agreement relating to congress provides for additional purchase price consideration to be paid to the former principals of congress in the payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain results of operations of the congress stores for the months following the acquisition as compared to certain financial thresholds stated in the purchase agreement 
no additional consideration has been included in our disclosure of the purchase price as it is not yet determinable if any such payments will be made 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of our sales and income from operations generated during the fourth quarter of each year  which includes the year end holiday season 
the fourth quarter of and each accounted for an average of approximately of our annual sales 
we have typically experienced net losses in the first three quarters of our fiscal year 
during these periods  working capital requirements have been funded by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
accordingly  the results for any of the first three quarters of any given fiscal year  taken individually or in the aggregate  are not indicative of annual results

a the fourth quarter of reflects the results of operations of congress since the date of acquisition in november b discontinued operations includes the after tax operations of the departments that were either divested or phased into the macy s east or macy s west divisions during as well as the belk department closings 
c net income loss per share for each quarter is computed as if each quarter were a discrete period 
as such  the total of the four quarters net income loss per share does not necessarily equal the net income loss per share for the year 
d the second  third and fourth quarters of reflect the results of operations of carlyle since the date of acquisition in mid may e the income loss from operations and the income loss from continuing operations include a charge of approximately million  on a pre tax basis  related to the impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of f net income loss and net income loss per share includes a charge of approximately million  net of tax  related to the impairment of goodwill during the second quarter of inflation the effect of inflation on our results of operations has not been material in the periods discussed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically re evaluated  as appropriate  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
however  since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially fr om those determined using necessary estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that we believe are most critical may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined by the lifo method utilizing an internally generated index 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates  and  as such  estimates are adjusted in the fourth quarter of each year 
factors related to inventories  such as future consumer demand and the economy s impact on consumer discretionary spending  inventory aging  ability to return merchandise to vendors  merchandise condition and anticipated markdowns  are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
an adjustment is recorded to reduce the lifo cost of inventories  if required  to their estimated net realizable values 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors above could have a significant impact on the value of the inventories and our reported operating results 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in lifo that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we estimate inventory shrinkage for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the reporting period on a store by store basis 
our inventory shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for estimating shrinkage 
as of february   our shrink reserve totaled million  compared to million as of january  additionally  during and  inventory shrinkage amounted to approximately and  respectively  of sales 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including cooperative advertising 
vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales upon the sale of merchandise or sg a when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended to be used has been fulfilled 
accordingly  a reduction in vendor allowances received would increase our cost of sales and or sg a 
vendor allowances have been accounted for in accordance with eitf vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor s products are recorded as an sg a reduction when the cost is incurred 
all other vendor allowances are initially deferred with the deferred amounts recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of vendor allowances has been reflected as a reduction to cost of sales 
as of february  and january   deferred vendor allowances totaled i million and million  respectively  for owned merchandise  which allowances are included as an offset to merchandise inventories on the consolidated balance sheets  and ii million and million  respectively  for merchandise received on consignment  which allowances are included as deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets finlay s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following

spacer

significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer

significant negative industry or economic trends  or 
spacer

store closings 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we recognize an impairment loss at the time the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets is less than its carrying value 
we measure impairment losses as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
to the extent future cash flows are less than anticipated  additional impairment charges may result 
there have been no adjustments to earnings resulting from the impairment of long lived assets for we also review the estimated useful lives of the assets and reduce such lives if necessary 
during  we recorded charges of approximately million related to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets for the federated and belk departments that closed in and for the parisian departments that will close in revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the sale of merchandise  either owned or consigned  to our customers  net of anticipated returns and net of sales taxes collected 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
as of february  and january   our allowance for sales returns totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision have been insignificant for and layaway deposits are not recognized as sales until fully paid for by the customer and the customer claims the merchandise 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for medical and workers compensation claims up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are determined based on an analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts that we will ultimately disburse could differ materially from the accrued amounts 
self insurance reserves aggregated million and million at february  and january   respectively 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  income taxes must be accounted for by the asset liability method 
the income tax effects of all revenues  expenses  gains  losses and other events that create differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their amounts for financial reporting are required to be recognized 
inherent in the measurement of these tax effects are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to the company s operations 
our effective tax rate considers management s judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which it is subject to tax 
at any given time  multiple tax years are open to audit by various taxing authorities 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon audit  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
accounting for acquisitions in may  finlay jewelry completed the acquisition of carlyle  and in november  finlay jewelry completed the acquisition of congress 
these acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
as such  we have undertaken an analysis of the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  and determined the excess of fair value of net assets acquired over cost 
we utilized estimates to determine the fair value of inventory and certain acquisition costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions must be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax position must initially and subsequently be recognized if it is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
fin also expands disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits 
the provisions of this interpretation are required to be adopted for fiscal periods beginning after december  the company will be required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab no 
requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial are now considered material  based on either a pproach not previously applied  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  a cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption
