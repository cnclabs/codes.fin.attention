table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  rubber and steel industries 
koppers serves its customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  which includes manufacturing facilities located in north america  australasia  china  europe and south africa 
we operate two principal businesses  carbon materials chemicals and railroad utility products 
through our carbon materials chemicals business of net sales  we believe we are the largest distiller of coal tar in north america  australia  the united kingdom and scandinavia 
we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote and phthalic anhydride  which are critical intermediate materials in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
through our railroad utility products business of net sales  we are the largest north american supplier of railroad crossties 
our other commercial wood treatment products include the provision of utility poles to the electric and telephone utility industries 
trend overview 
our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which could be negatively impacted by the relative increase in the value of coal tar as a fuel source as a result of higher energy prices  ii competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  particularly the european carbon pitch markets  and iii low margins in the utility pole business 
raw material prices have increased over the past several years  including our primary feedstocks coal tar  coal and lumber 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs  such as those occurring during  have resulted in margin dilution because only the increased cost is passed on to the customer 
we believe that the global restructuring of the carbon materials chemicals business has stabilized with respect to the north american and european markets  and that future expansion of the aluminum and carbon pitch markets will be primarily in asian and middle eastern countries 
we expect to expand into these markets to the extent that the economics justify such expansion 
utility pole markets are expected to continue to remain competitive with resulting low margins  we will continue to review under performing assets and rationalize capacity as necessary to remain competitive in this market and to reduce market share if warranted 
net sales over the past several years have been significantly impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates in australia  denmark and the united kingdom  in the event this trend reverses  net sales could decline if volumes do not increase 
coal tar supply management believes that our ability to source coal tar and carbon pitch from overseas markets through our foreign operations  as well as our research of petroleum feedstocks  will assist in securing an adequate supply of carbon pitch feedstocks 
however  we may experience shortages of coal tar from time to time due to unforeseen circumstances 
for example  we declared force majeure in july with respect to certain north american customer contracts as a result of an extended strike and reduced coke production at certain suppliers that resulted in a shortage of raw materials needed to fulfill customer commitments 
we subsequently declared an end to the force majeure declaration in december seasonality  effects of weather 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have been halted for short periods of time during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results have on average been significantly lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
we expect this seasonality trend to continue in future periods 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain sales and operating data  net of all intersegment transactions  for our businesses for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products total segment sales as percentage of total net sales carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products total gross margin by segment after depreciation and amortization carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products total operating margin by segment carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products total comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased from  million to  million  or  due primarily to higher sales for carbon materials chemicals

these increases were partially offset by lower carbon pitch volumes of million  or  and lower naphthalene volumes of million  or 
the price increase for carbon pitch was due primarily to higher raw material costs  and the phthalic anhydride and carbon black feedstock prices were favorably impacted by higher oil prices 
the price increase for phthalic anhydride was due primarily to higher costs for orthoxylene  which is a petroleum based feedstock used by all domestic competitors  but which is supplemented in our domestic operations by the use of internally produced naphthalene 
additionally  the impact of foreign exchange rates increased sales by million  freight costs in the us increased by million due primarily to the force majeure declaration in  and the increase in sales from a full year of the lambson acquisition amounted to million

the increase in prices for railroad crossties was due primarily to higher raw material prices  the increase in volumes for crossties and crosstie treating services was due to the exit from the business of a major competitor  and the reduction in volumes for utility poles was the result of targeting higher margin business 
gross margin after depreciation and amortization 
gross profit after depreciation and amortization increased from million to million 
as a percent of net sales  gross profit after depreciation and amortization decreased in total as a result of lower margins in both segments 
gross profit after depreciation and amortization for carbon materials chemicals increased from million to million 
gross margin for carbon materials chemicals decreased from to as the price increases for carbon pitch  phthalic anhydride  and carbon black feedstock  that were due primarily to higher raw material costs  had a dilutive effect on gross margins as a result of certain contract provisions that provide for passing through the higher raw materials costs to the customers 
margins in compared to were also negatively impacted as insurance

the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
our management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or when title passes to the customer 
we recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon transfer of title  which occurs upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer 
service revenue  consisting primarily of wood treating services  is recognized at the time the service is provided 
our recognition of revenue with respect to untreated crossties meets all the recognition criteria of sab topic a  including transfer of title and risk of ownership  the existence of fixed purchase commitments and delivery schedules established by the customer and the completion of all performance obligations by us 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
in the united states  carbon materials chemicals excluding furnace coke and railroad utility products inventories are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the lifo basis  or market 
inventories outside the united states are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the first in  first out basis fifo  or market 
market represents replacement cost for raw materials and net realizable value for work in process and finished goods 
lifo inventories constituted approximately and of the fifo inventory value at december  and  respectively 
long lived assets 
our management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  based on a number of factors including operating results  projected future cash flows and business plans 
we record long lived assets at the lower of cost or fair value  with fair value based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of fixed assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
in making this assessment  management relies on various factors  including operating results  estimated future cash flows  and business plans 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
because management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated 
goodwill valuations are performed using an average of actual and projected operating results of the relevant reporting units 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
additionally  disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
at december  our balance sheet included million of deferred tax assets 
we have determined that a valuation allowance of million are required for these deferred tax assets  based on future earnings projections 
to the extent that we encounter unexpected difficulties in market conditions  adverse changes in regulations affecting our businesses and operations  adverse outcomes in legal and environmental matters  or any other unfavorable conditions  the projections for future taxable income may be overstated and we may be required to record an increase in the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on income in the future 
accrued insurance 
we are insured for property  casualty and workers compensation insurance up to various stop loss amounts after meeting required retention levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the liability for the related retentions for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience 
in the event we incur a significant number of losses beyond the coverage retention limits  additional expense beyond the actuarial projections would be required 
asset retirement obligations 
we measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance  using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks 
in the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates  we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues 
pension and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided far into the future and allocating that cost over the time period each employee works 
this calculation requires extensive use of assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns  mortality  medical costs  employee turnover and discount rates 
in determining the expected return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate long term actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and estimates of future investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  we take into consideration a number of factors including our actual health care cost increases  the design of our benefit programs  the characteristics of our active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates 
because these items require our management s judgment  the related liabilities currently recorded by us could be lower or higher than amounts ultimately required to be paid 

table of contents legal matters 
we record liabilities related to legal matters when an adverse outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent we anticipate favorable outcomes to these matters which ultimately result in adverse outcomes  we could incur material adverse impacts on earnings and cash flows 
because such matters require significant judgments on the part of management  the recorded liabilities could be lower than what is ultimately required 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including  among other things  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  the discharge of effluent into waterways  the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters 
we expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third party claims  or otherwise incur costs  relating to cleanup of  or for injuries resulting from  contamination at sites associated with past and present operations 
we accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage the interest rate risks  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
this reduces the impact of short term fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  we enter into foreign currency debt instruments that are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating currencies on net income and equity 
we also use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments up to twelve months and all such contracts are marked to market with the recognition of a gain or loss at each reporting period 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our financial instruments and foreign operations to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  and the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
these forward looking statements are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments and foreign operations 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
as described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  we have both fixed and variable rate debt to manage interest rate risk and to minimize borrowing costs 
in january  we also entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with respect to notional million of the senior secured notes 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million at december  at december  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt  and at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt for both years including the swap 
our ratio of variable rate debt at december   including the interest rate swap referred to above  was approximately  reflecting an increase in the ratio from in the previous period due to the decrease in fixed rate senior secured notes 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels and foreign exchange rates  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  and would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the earnings and cash flows for the next year assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease approximately million  holding other variables constant 
with respect to the interest rate swap  a ten percent decrease in interest rates at december  would have decreased the unrealized fair market value of the interest rate swap by approximately million to a liability of million 
a ten percent increase in interest rates at december  would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the interest rate swap by approximately million to a liability of million 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis 
our exchange rate exposures result primarily from our investment and ongoing operations in australia  denmark and the united kingdom 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent reduction in all relevant exchange rates  the effect on our earnings  based on actual earnings from foreign operations for the years ended december  and  would be reductions of approximately million and million  respectively
