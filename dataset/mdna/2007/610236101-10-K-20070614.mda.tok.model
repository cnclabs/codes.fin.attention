table of contents results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from new stores which are defined as stores added since march   including million from the acquired procare stores  as well as a comparable store sales increase of 
fiscal was a week year  and  therefore  there were selling days in fiscal year as compared to selling days in fiscal year adjusting for days  comparable store sales increased 
during the year  stores were added and were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
as occurred in fiscal  the company completed the bulk sale of approximately million of slower moving inventory to icon international  a barter company 
the bulk sales of inventory to icon are important transactions for the company 
the sales help to improve inventory turns  which becomes a higher priority as interest rates continue to rise  and in light of the accounting rules of emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which require that vendor rebates be recognized as inventory turns 
as new vendor agreements fall under these rules  inventory turns have a more direct impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit than in the past 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors  including an increase in tire sales  scheduled maintenance services and alignments 
price increases in several product categories also contributed to the sales improvement 
comparable store traffic improved as did average ticket 
management believes that soft economic conditions resulted in consumers deferring repairs to their vehicles  especially in the first half of the company s fiscal year  which typically accounts for slightly more than of its sales and of its earnings 
in the first half of fiscal  the company s comparable store sales declined 
however  most repairs can only be deferred for a period of time 
when customers did come in to have their vehicles repaired  it is management s belief that they spent more on average because the problem with their vehicle had worsened due to additional wear 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers typically provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will continue to contribute positively to comparable store sales in future years  and have helped to mitigate the decline in exhaust which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
the exhaust decline resulted primarily from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on most new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s 
additionally  the company continued to reward store employees with pay programs focused on high customer service scores 
management believes that  in spite of the sluggish economic environment  it is continuing to build the trust of its customers  through quality  integrity and fair pricing  and is gaining an advantage over some of its competitors 
the new procare stores acquired on april  were purchased out of bankruptcy 
these stores suffered significant sales declines in recent years and did not perform at a profitable level in fiscal the procare stores lost approximately 
in diluted earnings per share in fiscal however  sales improved over the course of fiscal  efforts were made to reduce costs and improve margins  and management believes these stores will be solidly profitable in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the procare stores increased consolidated cost of sales and reduced gross profit by 
as a percentage of sales during fiscal the decrease in consolidated gross profit occurred primarily in the areas of labor and material costs 
even in times of declining sales  technicians receive a minimum base wage when they are not fully productive 
this subsidization of wages in the procare stores raised labor costs as a percentage of consolidated sales 
higher than normal outside purchases of parts by the procare stores increased total material 
table of contents costs 
however  the company saw declines in outside purchases over the course of the year as it added to  and rebalanced  the inventory at these locations 
the company expects to see more improvement in this expense line as it continues to refine the types and level of inventory which is carried at these stores  and as these stores continue to improve their level of transfers of product from neighboring stores 
additionally  due to negative comparable store sales at these locations  fixed occupancy costs created pressure on gross margin 
without the procare stores  gross profit was of sales for fiscal  as compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is due to a couple of factors 
one reason is the shift of vendor rebates or cooperative advertising credits from operating  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a to cost of sales 
additionally  the company earned more vendor rebates in fiscal than it did in fiscal these rebates offset the negative impact of the shift in mix to the lower margin tire and maintenance services categories 
decreases in technician labor and occupancy costs also contributed to the improvement in gross margin as compared to the prior year 
technician labor costs decreased due to better operational control and improved productivity 
additionally  the increase in tire sales  which carry lower labor costs as compared to other service categories  helped to decrease labor costs as a percent of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal also decreased as compared to fiscal  as the company  with improved sales  was able to better leverage these largely fixed costs 
additionally  expenditures for building maintenance in fiscal were slightly less than the prior year 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million  and increased as a percentage of sales to compared to in the procare stores accounted for a 
increase in store direct cost included in sg a as compared to the prior year 
manager pay and benefits are included in store direct costs  and being largely fixed  put adverse pressure on margins against negative comparable store sales in these locations 
in addition to the percentage increase attributable to the procare stores  a shift in cooperative advertising credits from sg a to cost of sales in connection with the accounting for new vendor agreements under eitf caused sg a expenses to increase approximately one percentage point as compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increases  however  was a decrease in management bonus expense due to the company not attaining minimum profit goals 
the company experienced an unplanned charge of million in workers compensation and garage liability insurance expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and these expenses also increased million over the same quarter of last year 
however  benefits expense in total  which includes workers compensation expense  was flat for the year as a percent of sales when compared to the prior year because of an offsetting decline in health insurance expense which had occurred over the course of fiscal general insurance expense for the full year  which includes garage liability insurance  increased only slightly over the prior year

million of expense related to stock options issued in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options and recognized a charge of approximately 
million just prior to adoption 
see additional discussion under the section fiscal as compared to fiscal most of this expense is included in sg a in both years

other expense  net  for fiscal was 
million  consisting of million related to the loss on investment in r s parts and service  inc and million of amortization expense

on a consolidated basis  tires represented of sales in fiscal as compared to of sales in fiscal maintenance services increased from of sales to of sales  while the core services of brakes  exhaust and steering all decreased as a percent of sales from the prior year 
the company also experienced cost increases in oil and tires 
additionally  the bulk sale of inventory to icon was at a lower margin than monro s typical sales  although there were no labor costs  and accounted for a slight decrease in gross margin 
however  price increases  as well as the recognition of vendor rebates against cost of goods in concert with inventory turns in accordance with eitf  helped to partially offset the aforementioned margin pressures 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in technician labor and occupancy costs  which are included in cost of sales

million  or 
per share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the vesting acceleration  the company estimates it eliminated the recognition of approximately  to  of non cash expense over the four fiscal years through  with more than half of the expense reduction attributable to fiscal most of the
