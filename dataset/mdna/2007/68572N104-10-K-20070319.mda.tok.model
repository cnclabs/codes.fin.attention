item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should specifically 
table of contents consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales were million in  up from million in we generated operating income of million in  down from operating income of million in our earnings per diluted share were per diluted common share in compared with per diluted common share in we generated million in positive operating cash flow in and have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last six years 
what did we focus on in our focus in was on two major initiatives 
the first initiative was related to our strategy to eliminate our reliance on third party parent rolls and reduce our production costs by installing and starting up a new paper machine 
our recent business growth increased our converting requirements beyond the paper making capacity of our older paper machines 
in the first six months of and in the year  approximately of our converting requirements were met through purchases of parent rolls from third parties which were at costs well above our internal cost of production 
in addition to providing adequate paper making capacity to meet our current converting requirements  the new paper machine will produce paper at a lower overall cost per ton than our older machines due to its high operating speeds and modern technology  thereby reducing our total paper costs per ton 
our goal of a successful on time start up and ramp up of our new paper machine was achieved by working with our project management engineering firm 
the official start up date of june  was within days of our targeted start up date set in and we achieved rated speeds on bathroom tissue by november and achieved of rated speeds on towel paper by the end of our second initiative was to continue to profitably grow the business 
our goal was to attain a level of converted product business that would consume our total paper making capacity 
by the fourth quarter of  we had attained a level of converted product business that consumed approximately of our total paper making capacity 
what challenges and opportunities did our business face in our new paper machine initiative which included an on time completion  a successful start up and meeting the planned ramp up period was a major challenge for our management 
achieving these objectives consumed a significant amount of management attention 
we experienced some operational difficulties during the project which affected our waste paper mix and paper machine yield during the first and second quarters of due to new equipment installation and process changes 
these issues were resolved in the third and fourth quarters 
we experienced cost pressures during the year in our waste paper prices  energy rates and packaging costs 
our waste paper prices increased approximately during the third and fourth quarters of compared to the prices paid in the first quarter of our electrical rates increased approximately beginning in the third quarter of prices paid for packaging increased approximately during the year 
focusing on in  we will continue to pursue profitable growth of our converted product business to sell out our remaining paper making capacity 
we will pursue this strategy through a combination of increased business with existing customers and new business in grocery and drug store retail channels 
any paper making capacity that is not consumed by the converting business will be sold as parent rolls in the third party market 

table of contents optimizing the operation of our new paper machine and other assets is a major focus for now that the paper machine start up is completed  management attention can be fully focused on improving our overall operating efficiency 
continuous improvement of our operations will be critical in helping combat cost pressures 
business overview we are a manufacturer and converter of tissue paper for the private label segment of the value retail consumer tissue market 
we have focused our product design and manufacturing on the discount retail market  primarily the dollar stores  due to their consistent order patterns  limited number of stock keeping units  or skus  offered and the growth being experienced in this channel of the retail market 
all of our revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our products 
our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of recycled waste paper used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting plant  and energy costs 
the private label segment of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
in june  we began operating a new paper machine with an annual capacity of approximately  tons 
the capacity of the new machine in addition to the capacity of a combination of our older machines increased our total production capacity to approximately  tons per year 
as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  we were able to eliminate the requirement to purchase parent rolls on the open market 
prior to the third quarter of  we had purchased parent rolls on the open market since because our own parent roll production had not adequately supplied the requirements of our converting facility 
we purchased approximately   and  tons of paper on the open market in  and  respectively  to supplement our paper making capacity 
parent rolls are a commodity product and thus are subject to market price and availability 
we experienced significantly higher parent roll prices beginning in early  as well as limited availability  which negatively affected our profitability 
we anticipate that the parent roll market will remain tight for the foreseeable future  resulting in a continuation of the high prices and limited availability 
comparative years ended december   and net sales successor predecessor period from period from combined march january year ended year ended december  december  february  december  in thousands  except average price per ton and tons net sales total tons shipped average price per ton net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net sales figures include gross selling price  including freight  less discounts and pricing allowances 
the increase in net sales experienced in was due primarily to higher sales of both converted products and parent rolls 
for the twelve months ended december   net sales of 
table of contents converted products increased approximately as compared to the same period in  the result of higher selling prices and increased shipments 
the increase in net selling prices is primarily due to sales price increases implemented in the first and second quarters of on a per ton basis  selling prices increased in the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in tons of converted product shipped in the period increased approximately compared to the period 
in addition  we shipped approximately  tons of parent rolls to third parties in the period following the mid year start up of our new paper machine and we did not ship any parent rolls in the period 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net sales experienced in was due primarily to servicing an additional distribution center at one of our large value retail customers  higher overall business with our larger value retail customers and to a lesser extent fill in business to one large customer s distribution center to remedy supply chain interruptions following hurricane katrina 
this fill in business ceased in the fourth quarter of we gained the additional distribution center in the latter part of the second quarter of our net selling price per ton in the year ended december   was  compared with  per ton in the same period of this increase in price per ton was primarily due to price increases implemented in the first and second quarters of and to a lesser extent  the price received for parent roll sales in the period

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december   was unfavorably affected by higher converting labor costs  depreciation  an unfavorable sales mix and higher costs of packaging materials  which were partially offset by lower overall paper costs 
the unfavorable mix is the result of an increase in bathroom tissue shipments as compared to towel shipments 
a change in the level of overall business with certain large customers is the primary reason for the mix swing 
depreciation for the year ended december  increased approximately  to million as a result of the start up of the million paper machine project in june cost of sales increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to in compared to in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was unfavorably affected by an increased quantity of parent rolls purchased from third parties  higher average cost of parent rolls and packaging materials  partially offset by reduced sheet counts on some finished products and lower operating lease payments 
in the first quarter of  we implemented sheet count 
table of contents reductions on certain finished products to several large customers 
the sheet count reduction was implemented in lieu of an increase in selling prices 
in july  we purchased a towel converting line that was leased in under an operating lease by exercising an early buyout option 
the purchase price for the early buyout was approximately million 
prior to the buyout  the million annual payment made pursuant to the operating lease was reflected in cost of sales 
the converting line has an estimated remaining useful life of  and is being depreciated over  years 
this transaction had the effect of reducing other cost of sales by  and increasing depreciation expense by  or a net reduction in cost of sales of  in compared to the following chart depicts the major factors that influence our paper costs

for the year ended december   approximately of the paper consumed in our converting operation was internally produced compared to for the same period in beginning in the third quarter of  parent roll production from our new paper machine eliminated the need to purchase recycled parent rolls from third parties and allowed us to sell approximately  tons of parent rolls during the last four months of we expect our overall parent roll production in to exceed our requirements for recycled converted product and we intend to sell our excess recycled parent rolls 
for the twelve months ended december   our internal cost of paper production  excluding depreciation  was per ton which was slightly higher than the per ton experienced in the same period of increased waste paper and electrical costs were mostly offset by lower per ton costs of fixed and semi variable costs 
an increase in waste paper costs experienced during the period  primarily in the third and fourth quarters  and lower yields in the first three quarters of the period during the final construction and start up period of our new paper machine resulted in an increase per ton in this component of our paper costs 
the increase in cases shipped in the year ended december   compared to required us to increase purchases of paper from third party suppliers by  tons to  tons or approximately of total tons consumed 
the cost per ton of parent rolls purchased was higher in as the parent roll market continued to experience shortages and also due to increasing energy costs

public company expenses were approximately  in the year ended december   compared with  in the same period in public company expenses were lower in because we were a privately held company until july artwork related expenditures increased approximately  in the period compared to the period due to a higher than normal number of packaging changes by existing customers and packing development with new customer accounts 
costs related to our management services agreement were lower in the twelve months ended december   by  as compared to the same period in due to a  lump sum payment made in which reduced our annual costs under the agreement from  to  the management services agreement has been terminated effective march  in the twelve months ended december   we recognized approximately  of stock option expense  including  of ongoing expense for options issued to management in april and  for options issued to certain members of the board of directors in february  june and december in the twelve months ended december   we recognized approximately  in stock option expense  including  for options issued to management and  for options issued to certain members of the board of directors in september and december in april  the stock incentive plan was approved by the board of directors and stockholders and in april  options for an aggregate of

in the year ended december   we recognized  in stock based compensation expense  a  lump sum payment made as part of an amendment to the management services agreement and higher broker commissions  which were partially offset by the non recurrence of  in payments made under the management incentive plan in and lower ongoing fees under our management services agreement the amended management services agreement reduced the annual management fee from  to  in exchange for the  lump sum payment 
commission expense increased at a rate lower than the net sales increase due to increased sales to customers where we do not utilize a broker

interest expense for the twelve months ended december   was million  net of  of capitalized interest  compared to interest expense in the period of million  net of  of capitalized interest 
including the capitalized interest  total interest cost  including amortization  increased million  to million in the period compared to million in the period 
gross interest expense increased as a result of borrowings in under our construction loan to fund our new paper machine  higher average borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  and higher interest rates 
during we borrowed million on the construction loan  the full amount available under the loan agreement 
we capitalized interest under the requirements of sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost in relation to our new paper machine project 
interest expense increased  to million in the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the additional debt we incurred in march as part of the acquisition of the predecessor company  borrowings under a new term loan to finance the previously discussed purchase of a towel converting line in july and the rise in interest rates during the comparative periods 
our acquisition of the predecessor company was financed with million of proceeds from the sale of common stock and a net increase in borrowings of approximately million 
other income was  in the twelve months ended december   compared to  in the same period of other income in the period was mainly comprised of  in interest income earned from a restricted certificate of deposit with our lending institution and a  foreign currency transaction gain 
other income in the period was mainly comprised of  of income earned from the investment of our unused proceeds from our initial public offering which was partially offset by a net foreign currency exchange loss of  in we entered into certain purchase agreements related to our new paper machine project 
one of 
table of contents these purchase agreements was denominated in euros 
we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the second quarter of to fix the price of this purchase agreement 
we made the final payment under the exchange contract and on the purchase order in the second quarter of the exchange contracts were carried at fair value and any adjustments to fair value affected net income 
in the period  the net proceeds of our initial public offering were used to fund the monthly construction costs of our new paper machine project 
the unused proceeds were invested in short term instruments such as high grade commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit until such time as they were required for construction funding 
as of december   the remaining unused net proceeds totaled  which were consumed in january other income increased  to  for the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  the increase is due to income of  earned from the investment of our unused net proceeds from our initial public offering being partially offset by a net foreign currency exchange loss of  at december   our outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaled  the exchange contracts were carried at fair value and any adjustments to fair value affected net income 
in the year ended december   we recorded a loss in our exchange contracts of  our minimum unpaid obligation under this purchase agreement as of december   was  and was accrued in accrued liabilities 
adjusting the obligation to the december   exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain of income before income taxes as a result of the foregoing factors  income before income taxes decreased million to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income before income taxes increased by  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  income tax provision benefit for the year ended december   the income tax benefit amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of a negative 
the primary reason for the benefit was the oklahoma investment tax credit oitc associated with our investment in a new paper machine 
also benefiting the tax provision was the federal indian employment credit iec  which was reinstated in december the law authorizing the iec had effectively lapsed at year end accordingly  the company was not able to recognize the iec in its tax provisions during the first three quarters of partially offsetting these benefits was the effect of the previously discussed non deductible stock option expense 
the current tax benefit of million primarily results from the carryback of net operating losses for tax purposes to tax years and the deferred provision of  is the result of substantial tax depreciation in excess of financial depreciation  partially offset by the recognition of investment  employment and other tax carryforwards for financial reporting purposes 
the law extending the iec also reinstated accelerated depreciation deductions  the most important of which was a four year tax life on investments in machinery and equipment placed in service on former indian lands in oklahoma 
accelerated depreciation will continue to benefit our current tax position for the next few years  as will the oitc  which is earned ratably over five years 
we expect to claim  in oitc in each of the next four years 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was  resulting from an effective tax rate of 
it is higher than the statutory rate because of non deductible stock option expense being partially offset by the utilization of federal indian employment credits 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was  resulting from an effective tax rate of 
our income tax expense was higher than the federal statutory rate in due to adjustment of amounts previously claimed for federal indian employment credits 
for the ten month period ended december   state income taxes were fully offset by investment and employment credits 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash as well as short term investments 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings 
our strategy to eliminate the need to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase of a new paper machine was funded through the net proceeds of our initial public offering  additional bank financing and cash flows from operations 
the total cost of the paper machine project was million  exclusive of capitalized interest 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise in full of the underwriter s option to purchase  shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
the shares were registered on form s file number  which the sec declared effective on july  the public offering price of the shares was 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
net proceeds from the offering were million with gross proceeds totaling million and with costs related to offering totaling million as follows underwriting discount of or million charged against additional paid in capital  and direct expenses of  charged against additional paid in capital  including legal fees  printing costs  accounting fees  qualified independent underwriter fees and other miscellaneous direct expenses 
as of december   all but  of the net proceeds had been used to fund expenditures for our new paper machine project 
the remaining funds were invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing instruments 
in january  we expended the remaining  on the paper machine project and we began to draw on the construction loan facility at that time 
cash decreased by  during to  at december  the decrease was attributable to the application of remaining funds from the public offering to the paper machine project 
the company has recorded a current income tax receivable at december  in the amount of million to recover federal income taxes paid in  and this asset should be realized during this is the result of net operating losses nol for tax purposes due largely to accelerated depreciation deductions for the new paper machine 
furthermore  the company estimates nol carryforwards of million federal and million state which are available to offset future taxable income 
in addition  the company plans to claim million in oklahoma investment tax credit oitc carryforward as of december   which is available to offset future oklahoma income tax liability 
the oitc carryforward is expected to grow over the next four years as it is earned ratably over five years at two percent per year on qualified investments 
we expect to claim  in oitc in each of the next four years 
the combination of accelerated depreciation deductions and the oitc will likely eliminate all oklahoma income tax liability for the next few years 
cash decreased by  during to  at december  in addition to the cash balances  we maintained million of short term investments in certificates of deposit at december  and the million is restricted under the provisions of our term loan agreement until april   the term date of our existing credit agreement 
we anticipate that the million will be used to reduce the principal amount of our bank debt 

table of contents the following table summarizes key cash flow information for the years ended december  and  the ten month period ended december  and the two month period ended february  successor predecessor period from period from combined march january year ended year ended december  december  february  december  in thousands cash flow data cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operations totaled million in the year ended december   essentially level with the same period in an increase in income taxes receivable in was mainly attributable to accelerated depreciation on the new paper machine 
the recently extended tax benefits for property placed in service on former indian lands added to the net operating loss for tax purposes 
this increase was largely offset by the absence of the inventory increase incurred during the absence was due to a scarcity of third party parent rolls available on the open market at year end accounts receivable increased during the year ended december   reflecting higher sales volumes 
accounts payable increased during the year ended december   reflecting higher levels of purchasing 
cash used in investing activities was million  mostly related to the new paper machine project 
capital expenditures for the new machine amounted to million in  inclusive of capitalized interest of  the start up date for the project was june  annual maintenance capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately  per year over the next several years which we expect to fund from operating cash flow 
in order to increase our converting capacity  we anticipate purchasing an additional converting equipment line in or at an estimated capital cost of million 
we also may be required to build a wastewater pre treatment facility at an estimated cost of million  probably some time after funding for these expenditures is expected to come from a combination of additional borrowings from lenders and operating cash flow 
cash provided from financing activities amounted to million in the year ended december   mainly attributable to borrowings under a construction loan agreement with established bank creditors 
cash provided from financing activities decreased from million in the year ended december  due to the absence of the proceeds from the initial public offering and reduced borrowing under the revolving credit line 
principal payments on the bank debt remained level at million in each period 
cash provided by operations decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the primary cause for the decrease was an investment in inventories and higher accounts receivable balances which were somewhat offset by higher earnings 
the inventory increase was primarily in parent roll and finished case inventory 
year end inventories were at below normal levels due to a lack of adequate availability of parent rolls in the fourth quarter of which affected production of finished goods and parent roll inventory levels 
accounts receivable also increased substantially in due to higher year over year sales volumes 
cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  the amount was due to capital expenditures of million  of which million were expenditures on our new paper machine project 
cash used in investing activities also included a net purchase of investment securities of  resulting from the initial investment of our net proceeds from our initial public offering and the subsequent sale of substantially all of those securities and  of short term investments held at december   to fund capital expenditures on our new paper machine project 
cash provided by financing activities increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in in  the cash provided was primarily 
table of contents a result of the million in net proceeds from our initial public offering and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  partially offset by million in term loan principal payments 
we entered into an amended and restated agented credit agreement with a bank group headed by the bank of oklahoma in june  to allow for the establishment of a construction loan needed to fund our new paper machine project 
this agreement expires on april  we intend to refinance these obligations on a long term basis prior to the expiration of the agreement 
we have received a commitment letter from a bank group headed by the bank of oklahoma to refinance the credit facility as described later in this document 
under the current amended agreement  we maintain a million revolving credit facility  of which there was million outstanding as of december   on an eligible borrowing base of million  which was limited to million per the terms of the agreement 
for reporting purposes  as of december   million of bank overdrafts were included in the long term debt section of the balance sheet  a million term loan  with a seven year amortization period  of which there was million outstanding as of december   and a million term loan  with a ten year amortization period  of which there was million outstanding as of december  amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit and the million term loan bear interest at our election at the prime rate or libor plus a margin based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income taxes paid 
the margin is set quarterly and ranges from negative basis points to basis points for prime rate loans and from to basis points for libor based loans 
at december   our borrowing rate on these loans was

the million term loan bears interest at our election at a floating rate of either basis points over prime or basis points over libor 
at december  our borrowing rate on this loan was 
libor elections are made for  or days periods 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we are required to maintain a balance of at least million in a separate interest reserve account until april or until the agreement is re financed  at which time these funds will be released 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are limited to a borrowing base  which is calculated on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
our revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and equipment purchases 
our credit facility includes covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain  on a quarterly basis  a specific ratio of funded debt to ebitda  a minimum level of tangible net worth  a specific debt service coverage ratio and limits our capital expenditures 
we amended our credit agreement in june and october to increase the funded debt to ebitda ratio and lower the debt service coverage ratio in order to avoid non compliance with the covenants for each quarter end 
in the october amendment  we increased the funded debt to ebitda ratio to to for the quarter ended september   and reverted the ratio to to for the remainder of the term of the agreement and decreased the debt service coverage ratio to to for the quarter ended september   and to for the quarter ended december  the debt service coverage ratio reverts to the original to for the remainder of the term of the agreement 
until april  effects of the million term loan  which directly related to the paper machine project  are excluded from the covenant calculations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
the loan facility includes an excess cash flow recapture provision 
the revolving credit facility and term loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
on march   orchids acquisition group  inc  which subsequently merged with and into us  sold units consisting of million principal amount of subordinated debentures and common stock warrants to help finance our acquisition 
the subordinated debentures were sold in units of  bearing interest at per year  payable quarterly  with each note including a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 

table of contents on march   we received a commitment letter from the bank of oklahoma  na 
to re finance our existing credit facility 
we intend to move forward with a re financing of the credit facility under the following terms and expect to complete the re financing prior to the april  expiration date of our current credit facility 
the proposed credit facility in the commitment letter consists of the following a million revolving credit facility with a year term  a million term loan a with a ten year term and twenty year amortization  a million term loan b with a four year term and six year amortization  and a million capital expenditures facility with a four year term and a five year amortization 
under the terms of the commitment letter  amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at our election at the prime rate or libor plus a margin and amounts outstanding under term loan b and the capital expenditures facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin  which is set quarterly and based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income taxes paid 
amounts outstanding under term loan a will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
for the revolving credit facility  the margin ranges from a negative basis points to basis points for prime rate loans and to basis points for libor based loans 
for term loan b  the margin ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
for the capital expenditures facility  the margin ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
the credit facility will contain covenants that will  among other things  require us to maintain a specific funded debt to ebitda ratio  debt service coverage ratio and an annual limit on un financed capital expenditures 
the current million restricted certificate of deposit will be released and applied to the revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were limited to our long term debt 
we do not have any leasing commitments or debt guarantees outstanding as of december  we do not have any defined benefit pension plans nor do we have any obligation to fund any postretirement benefit obligations for our work force 
maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years contractual cash obligations total and and after thousands long term debt interest payments total this schedule has been prepared based on our existing credit facility  which expires on april  a commitment letter was received on march  from the bank of oklahoma  na to re finance our existing credit facility  and we expect to close the agreement later in march or early in april of re financing our existing credit facility will extend the long term debt payments shown in the above table 
see note long term debt and note subsequent event to the financial statements in item in this form k for further discussion 
under orchids revolving credit and term loan agreement  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants  as amended 
these amounts assume interest payments at the year end borrowing amount and rate for our revolving credit facility 
the amount borrowed in future periods is dependent on our free cash flow from time to time 
interest payments on the term loans have been calculated based on the interest rate in effect as of december  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
accounts receivable balances that have been written off in the years ended december    and were   and  respectively

our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
during the year ended december   we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  during the year ended december   we decreased the inventory valuation reserve by  during the year ended december   we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues new accounting standards in a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting 
we have reviewed the recently issued pronouncements and concluded that the following new accounting standards are applicable to us 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments amending sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
eliminates the exemption from applying sfas no 
to securitized financial assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied to financial instruments issued or acquired during fiscal periods beginning after september  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin was issued in june it clarifies recognition and derecognition criteria for tax positions taken in a return that may be subject to challenge upon audit 
if it is more likely than not  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  the benefit is to be recognized in the financial statements 
conversely  if the position is less likely than not to be sustained  the benefit should not be recognized 
the recognition derecognition decision should be reflected in the first interim period when the status changes and not deferred to a future settlement upon audit 
general tax reserves to cover aggressive positions taken in filed returns are no longer allowable 
each issue must be judged on its own merits and a recognition derecognition decision recorded in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  because the company knowingly takes no aggressive positions in its tax 
table of contents returns and  accordingly  carries no income tax reserves on its books  this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations in future periods 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements which amends and puts in one place guidance on the use of fair value measurements which had been spread through four apb opinions and fasb standards 
no extensions of the use of fair value measurements are contained in this new pronouncement and  with some special industry exceptions eg  broker dealers  no significant changes in practice should ensue 
the standard is to be applied to financial statements beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
also in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and 
this standard requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of pension plans  rather than footnote disclosure which has been current practice 
publicly traded companies are to reflect the new standard in financial statements ending after december   and non public companies are to apply it in statements ending after june  because we do not maintain a defined benefit pension plan and have no plans to do so  this standard should not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

this standard permits the use of fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet with the net change in fair value recognized in periodic net income 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations because the majority of its debts and investment assets are variable rate and thus fair value approximates recorded value 
non gaap discussion in addition to our gaap results  we also consider non gaap measures of our performance for a number of purposes 
we use ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity 
ebitda represents net income before net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  it does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 

table of contents because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the years ended december   and  successor predecessor period from period from combined march january year ended year ended december  december  february  december  in thousands  except of net sales net income loss plus interest expense  net plus income tax expense benefit plus depreciation ebitda of net sales ebitda decreased  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the foregoing factors discussed in the net sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses sections are the reasons for the change 
ebitda increased  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the foregoing factors discussed in the net sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses sections are the reasons for the change 
however  the largest single cause for the decrease in ebitda as a percentage of sales was higher paper costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
our revolving line of credit and our term loans carry a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate borrowings of million  excluding bank overdrafts  which are classified with bank debt in the balance sheet  but which bear no interest 
outstanding balances under our line of credit and term loans bear interest at the prime rate or libor  plus a margin based upon the debt service coverage ratio 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it would be reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
based on the current borrowing  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a pre tax  increase to our annual interest expense
