item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this item should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements 
see exhibits and financial statement schedules 
overview we are a biotechnology company developing our proprietary surfactant technology as surfactant replacement therapies srt for respiratory disorders and diseases 
surfactants are produced naturally in the lungs and are essential for breathing 
our technology produces a precision engineered surfactant that is designed to closely mimic the essential properties of natural human lung surfactant 
we believe that through this srt technology  pulmonary surfactants have the potential  for the first time  to be developed into a series of respiratory therapies for patients in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu  pediatric intensive care unit picu  critical care unit and other hospital settings  where there are few or no approved therapies available 
our srt pipeline is focused initially on the most significant respiratory conditions prevalent in the nicu 
we have filed a nda with the fda for our lead product  surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants 
in april  we received an approvable letter from the fda in connection with this nda 
we are also developing surfaxin for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd in premature infants  a debilitating and chronic lung disease typically affecting premature infants who have suffered rds 
aerosurf is our proprietary srt in aerosolized form administered through nasal continuous positive airway pressure ncpap and is being developed for the prevention and treatment of infants at risk for respiratory failure 
aerosurf has the potential to obviate the need for endotracheal intubation and conventional mechanical ventilation 
in addition to potentially treating respiratory conditions prevalent in the nicu  we also believe that our srt potentially will address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions affecting pediatric  young adult and adult patients in the critical care and other hospital settings  such as acute respiratory failure arf  cystic fibrosis  acute lung injury ali  acute respiratory distress syndrome ards  chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder copd  asthma and other debilitating respiratory conditions 
we are implementing a business strategy that includes undertaking actions intended to gain regulatory approval to market and sell surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants in the united states  including i finalizing and submitting our response to the april approvable letter  which focused on the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc portion of our nda  and ii completing analysis and remediation of manufacturing issues related to the april process validation stability failure  continued investment in the development of our srt pipeline programs  including surfaxin for neonatal and pediatric conditions and aerosurf  which uses the aerosol generating technology rights that we have licensed through a strategic alliance with chrysalis technologies  a division of philip morris usa inc chrysalis  continued investment in enhancements to our quality systems and our manufacturing capabilities  including our operations in totowa  nj which we acquired in december 
we plan to i produce surfactant drug products to meet the anticipated pre clinical  clinical and potential future commercial needs of surfaxin and our other srt product candidates  beginning with aerosurf  and ii potentially develop new and enhanced formulations of surfaxin and our other srt product candidates 
we view the acquisition of our own manufacturing operation as an initial step in our long term manufacturing strategy 
our long term strategy includes building or acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities for the production of our precision engineered srt drug products  and seeking investments of additional capital and potentially entering into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of our srt product candidates 
in june  we engaged jefferies company  inc  a new york based investment banking firm  under an arrangement that expires in june  to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives intended to enhance the future growth potential of our srt pipeline and maximize shareholder value 
in november  we raised million in a private placement transaction 
we continue to evaluate a variety of strategic transactions  including  but not limited to  potential business alliances  commercial and development partnerships  financings and other similar opportunities  although we cannot assure you that we will enter into any specific actions or transactions 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million including historical results of predecessor companies 
the majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and  during and the first half of  also include significant general and administrative expense  primarily pre commercialization activities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plan of operations 
historically  we have funded our operations with working capital provided principally through public and private equity financings  debt arrangements and strategic collaborations 
as of december   we had i cash of million  ii approximately million shares potentially available for issuance under the ceff with kingsbridge for future financings not to exceed million  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  iii million outstanding million principal and million of accrued interest as of december  on a loan from pharmabio development inc d b a novaquest pharmabio  the strategic investment group of quintiles transnational corp 
quintiles  which  after a recent restructuring  is due and payable  together with all accrued interest  on april   and iv million outstanding on a capital equipment lease financing arrangement with general electric capital corporation gecc  which expired on october   of which an aggregate of million was drawn during the life of the facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
these costs are charged to operations as incurred and are tracked by category rather than by project 
research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with research  formulation development  manufacturing development  clinical and regulatory operations and other direct preclinical and clinical projects 
in  we incurred a non recurring charge of million associated with the purchase of the manufacturing operations at the totowa  nj facility and which we classified as in process research and development 
the one time charge is not reflected in the following discussion 
these cost categories typically include the following expenses research and formulation development research and formulation development activities  primarily conducted at our operations located in california  reflect research and development of aerosolized and other related formulations of our precision engineered lung surfactant  engineering of aerosol delivery systems and analytical chemistry activities to support the continued development of surfaxin 
research and formulation development costs primarily reflect expenses incurred for personnel  consultants  facilities and research and development arrangements with collaborators including a research funding and option agreement with the scripps research institute which expired in february 
manufacturing development manufacturing development primarily reflects costs incurred to develop current good manufacturing practices cgmp manufacturing capabilities in order to provide clinical and commercial scale drug supply 
manufacturing development activities include costs associated with operating our manufacturing facility in totowa  nj which we acquired from our then contract manufacturer  laureate pharma  inc laureate in december to support the production of clinical and anticipated commercial drug supply for the company s srt programs  such as employee expenses  depreciation  the purchase of drug substances  quality control and assurance activities  and analytical services  and continued investment in our quality assurance and analytical chemistry capabilities  including implementation of enhancements to quality controls  process assurances and documentation requirements that support the production process and expanding the operations to meet production needs for our srt pipeline in accordance with cgmp 
in addition  manufacturing activities include expenses associated with our ongoing comprehensive investigation  analysis of the april surfaxin process validation stability failure and remediation of the company s related manufacturing issues 
unallocated development clinical and regulatory operations clinical and regulatory operations reflect the preparation  implementation and management of our clinical trial activities in accordance with current good clinical practices cgcps 
included in unallocated clinical development and regulatory operations are costs associated with personnel  supplies  facilities  fees to consultants  and other related costs for clinical trial implementation and management  clinical quality control and regulatory compliance activities  data management and biostatistics 
direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses include pre clinical activities associated with the development of srt formulations prior to the initiation of any potential human clinical trials and activities associated with conducting clinical trials  including patient enrollment costs  external site costs  expense of clinical drug supply and external costs such as contract research consultant fees and expenses 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses by each of the foregoing categories for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  research and development expenses research and formulation development manufacturing development unallocated development clinical and regulatory operations direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses total research and development expenses included in research and development expenses for the year ended december  is a charge of million associated with stock based employee compensation in accordance with the provisions of statement no

due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete projects in development are not reasonably estimable 
results from clinical trials may not be favorable and data from clinical trials are subject to varying interpretation and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
currently  none of our drug product candidates are available for commercial sale 
all of our potential products are in regulatory review  clinical or pre clinical development 
the status and anticipated completion date of each of our lead srt programs are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations plan of operations 
successful completion of development of our srt is contingent on numerous risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are described in detail in risk factors 
development risk factors include  but are not limited to completion of pre clinical and clinical trials of our srt product candidates with scientific results that are sufficient to support further development and or regulatory approval  receipt of necessary regulatory approvals  obtaining adequate supplies of surfactant active drug substances on commercially reasonable terms  obtaining capital necessary to fund our operations  including our research and development efforts  manufacturing requirements and clinical trials  obtaining strategic partnerships and collaboration agreements for the development of our srt pipeline  including surfaxin and aerosurf  performance of our third party collaborators and suppliers on whom we rely for supply of drug substances  medical device components and related services necessary to manufacture our srt drug product candidates  including surfaxin and aerosurf  timely and successful resolution of the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc and cgmp related matters at our manufacturing operations in totowa  nj with respect to surfaxin and our other srts presently under development  including those we have identified in connection with our recent process validation stability failures and matters that were noted by the fda in its inspectional reports on form fda  successful manufacture of srt drug product candidates  including surfaxin  at our operations in new jersey  successful development and implementation of a manufacturing strategy for the chrysalis aerosolization device and related materials to support clinical studies and commercialization of aerosurf  and obtaining additional manufacturing operations  for which we presently have limited resources 
because these factors  many of which are outside our control  could have a potentially significant effect on our activities  the success  timing of completion  and ultimate cost of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
the timing and cost to complete drug trials alone may be impacted by  among other things slow patient enrollment  long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness  lack of sufficient clinical supplies and material  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  lack of compatibility with complimentary technologies  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and lack of sufficient funds 
if we do not successfully complete clinical trials  we will not receive regulatory approval to market our srt products 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval and generate revenues from the sale of our products  such a failure would have a material adverse effect on our value  financial condition and results of operations 
corporate partnership agreements chrysalis technologies  a division of philip morris usa inc in december  we entered into a strategic alliance with chrysalis to develop and commercialize aerosol srt to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions  such as neonatal respiratory failure  ali  cystic fibrosis  chronic obstructive respiratory disorder  asthma  and others 
through this alliance  we gained exclusive rights to chrysalis aerosolization technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases 
the alliance unites two complementary respiratory technologies our precision engineered surfactant technology with chrysalis novel aerosolization technology that is being developed to deliver therapeutics to the deep lung 
chrysalis has developed a proprietary aerosol generation technology that is being designed with the potential to enable targeted upper respiratory or deep lung delivery of therapies for local or systematic applications 
the chrysalis technology is designed to produce high quality  low velocity aerosols for possible deep lung aerosol delivery 
aerosols are created by pumping the drug formulation through a small  heated capillary wherein the excipient system is substantially converted to the vapor state 
upon exiting the capillary  the vapor stream quickly cools and slows in velocity yielding a dense aerosol with a defined particle size 
the defined particle size can be readily controlled and adjusted through device modifications and drug formulation changes 
the alliance focuses on therapies for hospitalized patients  including those in the nicu  pediatric intensive care unit picu and the adult intensive care unit icu  and can be expanded into other hospital applications and ambulatory settings 
we and chrysalis are utilizing our respective capabilities and resources to support and fund the design and development of combination drug device systems that can be uniquely customized to address specific respiratory diseases and patient populations 
chrysalis is responsible for developing the design for the aerosolization device platform  disposable dose packets and patient interface 
we are responsible for aerosolized srt drug formulations  clinical and regulatory activities  and the manufacturing and commercialization of the combination drug device products 
we have exclusive rights to chrysalis aerosolization technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases and conditions in hospital and ambulatory settings 
generally  chrysalis will receive a tiered royalty on product sales the base royalty generally applies to aggregate net sales of less than million per contract year  the royalty generally increases on aggregate net sales in excess of million per contract year  and generally increases further on aggregate net sales of alliance products in excess of billion per contract year 
our lead neonatal program utilizing the chrysalis technology is aerosurf  an aerosolized formulation administered via ncpap to treat premature infants in the nicu at risk for rds 
we are also planning an adult program utilizing the chrysalis aerosolization technology to develop aerosolized srt administered as a prophylactic for patients in the hospital at risk for ali and will be assessing the timing for implementation of our adult program in laboratorios del dr 
esteve  sa in december  we further restructured our strategic alliance with laboratorios del dr 
esteve  sa esteve for the development  marketing and sales of our products 
we had first entered into the alliance in and had revised it in to broaden the territory to include all of europe  central and south america  and mexico 
under the revised alliance  we have regained full commercialization rights to our srt  including surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants and the treatment of ards in adults  in key european markets  central america and south america 
esteve will focus on andorra  greece  italy  portugal  and spain  and now has development and marketing rights to a broader portfolio of potential srt products 
esteve will pay us a transfer price on sales of surfaxin and other srt 
we will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of all of the covered products and esteve will be responsible for all sales and marketing in the revised territory 
we also agreed to pay to esteve of cash up front and milestone fees not to exceed million in the aggregate that we may receive in connection with any future strategic collaborations for the development and commercialization of surfaxin for rds  ards or certain other srts in the territory for which we had previously granted a license to esteve 
esteve has agreed to make stipulated cash payments to us upon its achievement of certain milestones  primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for the covered products 
in addition  esteve has agreed to contribute to phase clinical trials for the covered products by conducting and funding development performed in the revised territory 
in october  esteve sublicensed the distribution rights to surfaxin in italy to domp farmaceutici spa domp  a privately owned italian company 
under the sublicense agreement  domp will be responsible for sales  marketing and distribution of surfaxin in italy 
plan of operations we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to continue to expend substantial amounts for continued product research  development  manufacturing  and general business activities 
we anticipate that during the next to months research and development we will focus our research  development and regulatory activities in an effort to develop a pipeline of potential srt for respiratory diseases 
the drug development  clinical trial and regulatory process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and subject to numerous risks including  without limitation  the applicable risks discussed in risk factors 
see management s discussion and analysis research and development 
our major research and development projects include srt for neonatal intensive care unit in order to address the most prevalent respiratory disorders affecting infants in the nicu  we are conducting several nicu therapeutic programs targeting respiratory conditions cited as some of the most significant unmet medical needs for the neonatal community 
surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants in april  we received a second approvable letter from the fda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
specifically  the fda requested information primarily focused on the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section of the nda  predominately involving the further tightening of active ingredient and drug product specifications and related controls 
also in april  ongoing analysis of surfaxin process validation batches that had been manufactured for us in by our contract manufacturer  laureate pharma  inc laureate as a requirement for our nda indicated that certain stability parameters no longer met acceptance criteria 
we immediately initiated a comprehensive investigation  which focused on analysis of manufacturing processes  analytical methods and method validation and active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers  to determine the cause of the failure 
as a result of this investigation  we developed a corrective action and preventative action plan to remediate the related manufacturing issues 
in september  we submitted a request for a meeting with the fda together with an information package that covered certain of the key cmc matters contained in the approvable letter and provided information concerning the status and interim findings of our comprehensive investigation into the surfaxin process validation stability failure and our efforts to remediate the related manufacturing issues 
on december   we attended a meeting with the fda  the purpose of which was to clarify the issues identified by the fda in the approvable letter and obtain guidance from the fda on the appropriate path to potentially gain approval of surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
following that meeting and consistent with the guidance from the fda  we completed the manufacture of new surfaxin process validation batches  which are undergoing release and ongoing stability testing 
this stability data is expected to support our formal response to the approvable letter  which we presently anticipate filing in september or october assuming that the fda accepts our response as a complete response  we anticipate a six month fda review period for potential approval of our nda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
in june  we voluntarily withdrew the marketing authorization application maa filed in october with the european medicines agency emea for clearance to market surfaxin for the prevention and rescue treatment of rds in premature infants in europe because our manufacturing issues would not be resolved within the regulatory time frames mandated by the emea procedure 
our withdrawal of the maa precluded final resolution of certain outstanding clinical issues related to the surfaxin phase clinical trials  which had been the focus of a recent emea clinical expert meeting and were expected to be reviewed at a planned oral explanation before the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp in late june we plan in the future to have further discussions with the emea and develop a strategy to potentially gain approval for surfaxin in europe 
surfaxin for bpd in premature infants in october  we announced preliminary results of our recently completed phase clinical trial of surfaxin for the prevention and treatment of bpd 
we believe that these results suggest that surfaxin may potentially represent a novel therapeutic option for infants at risk for bpd 
comprehensive analysis of the data from this trial is ongoing 
following this analysis  in collaboration with our steering committee and investigators  we expect to present the study results to the medical community and submit the data for publication in a peer review journal as well as determine the next development steps for this program 
aerosurf  aerosolized srt in september  we completed and announced the results of our first pilot phase clinical study of aerosurf  which was designed as an open label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety and tolerability of aerosurf delivered using a commercially available aerosolization device aeroneb pro via ncpap for the prevention of rds in premature infants administered within minutes of birth over a three hour duration 
the study showed that it is feasible to deliver aerosurf via ncpap and that the treatment was generally safe and well tolerated 
we are presently collaborating with chrysalis on the development of a prototype aerosolization system to deliver aerosurf to patients in the nicu and  if successful  plan to initiate multiple phase clinical studies of aerosurf utilizing the chrysalis aerosolization technology in the second half of see surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants  above 
srt for critical care and hospital indications in march  we announced preliminary results of a phase open label  controlled  multi center clinical trial of our srt for the treatment of ards in adults 
the trial was designed to enroll up to patients and was structured in two parts 
total enrollment in the trial was patients 
the objective of the surfactant lavage was to restore functional surfactant levels in the patients lungs  thereby improving oxygenation measured by an increase the p f ratio  in order to remove critically ill patients from mechanical ventilation sooner 
we plan to submit data from the study for publication in a peer review journal 
we also plan to seek potential partners  with which we can apply the scientific and clinical observations generated from this trial to support the design of potential future trials to treat ards 
we are also evaluating the potential development of our proprietary precision engineered srt to address respiratory disorders such as arf  cystic fibrosis  ali  copd  asthma  and other debilitating respiratory conditions 
we plan on initiating clinical studies in for certain of these respiratory disorders 
manufacturing our precision engineered surfactant product candidates  including surfaxin  must be manufactured in compliance with cgmps established by the fda and other international regulatory authorities 
surfaxin is a complex drug and  unlike many drugs  contains four active ingredients 
it must be aseptically manufactured at our facility as a sterile  liquid suspension and requires ongoing monitoring of the stability and conformance to product specifications of each of the four active ingredients 
we plan to invest in and support our manufacturing strategy for the production of our precision engineered srt to meet anticipated clinical needs and  if approved  commercial needs in the united states  europe and other markets manufacturing new jersey operations in december  we purchased our manufacturing operations from laureate our contract manufacturer at that time and entered into a transitional services arrangement under which laureate agreed to provide us with certain limited manufacturing related support services through december in july  we completed the transition and terminated the arrangement with laureate 
owning the totowa operation has provided us with direct operational control and  we believe  potentially improved economics for the production of clinical and potential commercial supply of our lead product  surfaxin  and our srt pipeline products 
this facility is the only facility in which we produce our drug product 
we view our acquisition of the totowa operations as an initial step of our long term manufacturing strategy for the continued development of our srt portfolio  including life cycle management of surfaxin for new indications  potential new formulations and formulation enhancements  and expansion of our aerosol srt products  beginning with aerosurf 
i in april  ongoing analysis of surfaxin process validation batches that had been manufactured for us in by our then contract manufacturer  laureate  as a requirement for our nda indicated that certain stability parameters no longer met acceptance criteria 
we immediately initiated a comprehensive investigation  which focused on analysis of manufacturing processes  analytical methods and method validation and active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers  to determine the cause of the failure 
as a result of this investigation  we developed a corrective action and preventative action plan to remediate the related manufacturing issues 
in september  we submitted a request for a meeting with the fda together with an information package that covered certain of the key cmc matters contained in the approvable letter and provided information concerning the status and interim findings of our comprehensive investigation into the surfaxin process validation stability failure and our efforts to remediate the related manufacturing issues 
following a meeting with the fda on december   and consistent with the guidance from the fda  we completed the manufacture of new surfaxin process validation batches  which are undergoing release and ongoing stability testing 
long term manufacturing capabilities we are planning to have manufacturing capabilities  primarily through our manufacturing operation in totowa  nj  that should allow for sufficient commercial production of surfaxin  if approved  to supply the potential worldwide demand for the prevention of rds in premature infants  the prevention and treatment of bpd and all of our anticipated clinical scale production requirements for srt for aerosurf 
we view our acquisition of manufacturing operations in totowa  nj as an initial step of our manufacturing strategy for the continued development of our srt portfolio  including life cycle management of surfaxin for new indications  potential new formulations and formulation enhancements  and expansion of our aerosol srt products  beginning with aerosurf 
the lease for our totowa  nj facility extends through december in addition to customary lease terms and conditions  the lease contains an early termination option  first beginning in december the early termination option can only be exercised by the landlord upon a minimum of two years prior notice and  in the earlier years  payment to us of significant early termination amounts 
taking into account this early termination option  which may cause us to move out of our totowa  nj facility as early as december  our long term manufacturing strategy includes potentially building or acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities  as well as using contract manufacturers  for the production of our precision engineered srt drug products 
aerosol devices and related componentry to manufacture aerosolization systems for our planned clinical trials  we expect to utilize third party contract manufacturers  suppliers and assemblers 
the manufacturing process will require assembly of the key device sub components that comprise the aerosolization systems  including the aerosol generating device  the disposable dose delivery packet and patient interface system necessary to administer our aerosolized srt in patients in the nicu and icu 
we expect that third party vendors will manufacture these key device sub components  and ship them to one central location for assembly and integration into the aerosolization system 
once assembled  critical product contact components and or assemblies are packaged and sterilized 
each of the aerosolization systems will be quality control tested prior to release for use in our clinical trials or  potentially  for commercial use 
to complete the combination drug device product  we plan to manufacture the srt drug product at our totowa  nj facility 
see the applicable risks discussed in risk factors 
general and administrative we intend to invest in general and administrative resources in the near term primarily to support our legal requirements  intellectual property portfolios including building and enforcing our patent and trademark positions  our business development initiatives  financial systems and controls  management information technologies  and general management capabilities 
potential collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships we intend to seek investments of additional capital and potentially enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of our srt product candidates 
we have engaged jefferies company  inc  a new york based investment banking firm  under an arrangement that expires in june  to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives intended to enhance the future growth potential of our srt pipeline and maximize shareholder value 
in november  we raised million in a private placement transaction 
we continue to evaluate a variety of strategic transactions  including  but not limited to  potential business alliances  commercial and development partnerships  financings and other similar opportunities  although we cannot assure you that we will enter into any specific actions or transactions 
we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales  related royalties and transfer prices to achieve and maintain profitability 
through december   we had no revenues from any product sales  and had not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon  among other things  our ability to develop products  obtain regulatory approval for products under development and enter into agreements for product development  manufacturing and commercialization 
in addition  our results are dependent upon the performance of our strategic partners and suppliers 
moreover  we may never achieve significant revenues or profitable operations from the sale of any of our products or technologies 
through december   we had not generated taxable income 
on december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal tax purposes were approximately million 
the future utilization of such loss carryforward may be limited pursuant to regulations promulgated under section of the internal revenue code 
in addition  we had a research and development tax credit carryforward of million at december  the federal net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in through critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified below some of our more critical accounting policies and changes to accounting policies

revenue recognition research and development collaborative agreements for up front payments and licensing fees related to our contract research or technology  we defer and recognize revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenue earned under our research and development collaborative agreement contracts is recognized over a number of years as we perform research and development activities 
for up front payments and licensing fees related to our contract research or technology  we defer and recognize revenue as earned over the estimated period in which the services are expected to be performed 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to incur research and development costs as we continue to expand our product development activities 
our research and development costs have included  and will continue to include  expenses for internal development personnel  supplies and facilities  clinical trials  regulatory compliance and reviews  validation of processes and start up costs to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities 
once a product candidate is approved by the fda  if at all  and we begin commercial manufacturing  we will no longer expense certain manufacturing costs as research and development costs for any such product 
results of operations the net loss for the years ended december   and were million or per share  million or per share and million or per share  respectively

in process research development in december  we purchased laureate s manufacturing operations in totowa  nj for million and incurred additional related expenses of million 
we are using this facility for pharmaceutical manufacturing and development activities 
we believe this acquisition was a logical way to implement a long term manufacturing strategy for the continued development of our srt portfolio  including life cycle management of surfaxin for new indications  potential new formulations and enhancements  and expansion of our aerosol srt products  beginning with aerosurf 
the manufacturing facility in totowa  nj consists of approximately  square feet of leased pharmaceutical manufacturing and development space that is specifically designed for the production of sterile pharmaceuticals in compliance with cgmp requirements 
there are approximately personnel that are qualified in sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing and currently employed at the facility 
in october  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with laureate  pursuant to which the transfer of our surfaxin manufacturing know how and dedicated equipment to this facility was completed in from that time and until our acquisition of the operation in december  the facility was predominantly dedicated to surfaxin and the support of regulatory compliance requirements for our manufacturing operations

the loan with pharmabio  which was also amended  remained available with million outstanding 
the original maturity date of december  has been twice amended such that the outstanding principal and all unpaid interest is now payable on april  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources debt

under the revised alliance  we have regained full commercialization rights to our srt  including surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants and the treatment of ards in adults  in key european markets  central america and south america

see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to continue to make significant investments for continued product research  development  manufacturing and commercialization activities 
historically  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and the use of debt and capital lease facilities 
we are subject to risks customarily associated with the biotechnology industry  which requires significant investment for research and development 
there can be no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval  or that any approved product will be commercially viable 
we plan to fund our research  development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities through the issuance of equity and debt financings  payments from potential strategic collaborators  including license fees and sponsored research funding  sales of surfaxin  if approved  sales of our other product candidates  if approved  capital lease financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of the product development and commercialization plan 
even if we succeed in developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed with acceptable terms  if at all 
these factors could significantly limit our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have developed operating plans that ensure expenditures will only be committed if we have the necessary cash resources 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  on acceptable terms  we have determined we have the ability to adjust our expenditures to ensure that our existing capital will allow us to continue operations through at least january  we have engaged jefferies company  inc  a new york based investment banking firm  under an arrangement that expires in june  to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives intended to enhance the future growth potential of our srt pipeline and maximize shareholder value

we anticipate using the ceff  when available  to support working capital needs in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities of million  as compared to million as of december  the change from december   is primarily due to million used in operating activities  million used to purchase capital expenditures and million used to pay principal payments on capital lease arrangements 
these cash outflows were offset by cash inflows  which primarily consisted of i a private placement of  shares resulting in net proceeds of million  ii three financings pursuant to the ceff resulting in the issuance of  shares and net proceeds of million  iii million of financing associated with capital lease arrangements  and iv million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants

as of december   there were approximately million shares available for issuance under the ceff for future financings not to exceed million in gross proceeds 
the ceff allows us to raise capital  subject to certain conditions that we must satisfy  at the time and in amounts deemed suitable to us  during a three year period that began on may  we are not obligated to utilize the entire million available under this ceff 
the purchase price of shares sold to kingsbridge under the ceff is at a discount ranging from to percent of the volume weighted average of the price of our common stock vwap for each of the eight trading days following our initiation of a draw down under the ceff 
the discount on each of these eight trading days is determined as follows vwap of vwap applicable discount greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than per share less than or equal to but greater than or equal to per share as such term is set forth in the common stock purchase agreement 
if on any trading day during the eight trading day pricing period for a draw down  the vwap is less than the greater of i or ii percent of the closing price of our common stock for the trading day immediately preceding the beginning of the draw down period  no shares will be issued with respect to that trading day and the total amount of the draw down will be reduced by one eighth of the draw down amount we had initially specified 
our ability to require kingsbridge to purchase our common stock is subject to various limitations 
each draw down is limited to the lesser of percent of the closing price market value of our outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of the draw down or million 
unless kingsbridge agrees otherwise  a minimum of three trading days must elapse between the expiration of any draw down pricing period and the beginning of the next draw down pricing period

future capital requirements unless and until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to require substantial additional funding to conduct our business  including our manufacturing  research and product development activities and to repay our indebtedness
