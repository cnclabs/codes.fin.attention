overview we are a market focused company primarily engaged in the design  manufacture  sales and service of high technology digital imaging solutions to the graphic arts industry worldwide 
we are helping to lead the industry s transformation from analog print production methods to digital imaging technology 
we are a leader in the development of advanced printing systems using digital imaging equipment and consumables based solutions that economically benefit the user through a streamlined workflow and chemistry free  environmentally responsible operation 
we are also a leading sales and service channel in the small to mid sized commercial  quick and in plant printing markets offering a wide range of solutions to over  customers worldwide 
presstek s business model is a capital equipment and consumables razor and blade model 
in this model  approximately of our revenue is recurring revenue 
our model is designed so that each placement of either a direct imaging press or a computer to plate system results in recurring aftermarket revenue for consumables and service 
through our various operations  we provide advanced print solutions through the development and manufacture of digital laser imaging equipment and advanced technology chemistry free printing plates  which we call consumables  for commercial and in plant print providers targeting the growing market for high quality  fast turnaround short run color printing  are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek digital solutions and solutions from other manufacturing partners through our direct sales and service force and through distribution partners worldwide  manufacture semiconductor solid state laser diodes for presstek imaging applications and for use in external applications  and distribute printing plates for conventional print applications 
we have developed a proprietary system by which digital images are transferred onto printing plates for direct imaging on press applications and for computer to plate applications 
we refer to direct imaging as di and computer to plate as ctp 
our digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
our ground breaking di technology is marketed to leading press manufacturers 
our presstek business segment supplies these manufacturers with imaging kits complete with optical assemblies and software which are integrated into the manufacturers presses 
the result is a di press  which is designed to image our printing plates 
similar digital imaging technologies are used in our ctp systems 
our presstek business segment designs and manufactures ctp systems that incorporate our imaging technology and image our chemistry free printing plates 
in addition to marketing  selling and servicing our proprietary digital products  we also market  sell and service traditional  or analog products for the commercial print market 
this analog equipment is manufactured by third party strategic partners and analog consumables are manufactured by either us or our strategic partners 
the addition of these non proprietary products and our ability to directly sell and service them is made possible by acquisitions we completed in abdick and precision 
on november   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  abd international  inc completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the the ab dick company  which we acquired through a section sale in the united states bankruptcy court 
we refer to the business that we acquired as the abdick business 
the business we acquired manufactures  markets and services offset systems  ctp systems and related supplies for the graphics arts and printing industries 
in  we substantially completed the integration of the operations of the abdick business into presstek 
on july   we acquired all the stock of precision lithograining corporation  an independent plate manufacturer located in south hadley  massachusetts  which we refer to as precision 
precision manufactures our anthem and freedom digital printing plates and prior to december   the date on which the company discontinued operations related to precision s newspaper analog business  it provided conventional analog printing plates for web and sheet fed applications to external customers 
lasertel  inc  a subsidiary of presstek  is primarily engaged in the manufacture and development of high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
lasertel s products include semiconductor lasers and active components for the graphics  defense  industrial  and medical industries 
lasertel offers high powered laser diodes in both standard and customized configurations  including chip on sub mount  un mounted bars  and fiber coupled devices  to support various applications 
our operations are organized based on the market application of our products and related services and consist of two reportable segments presstek and lasertel 
the presstek segment is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and servicing of our patented digital imaging systems and patented printing plate technologies as well as traditional  analog systems and related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries  primarily the short run  full color market segment 
the lasertel segment manufactures and develops high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
we generate revenue through four main sources i the sale of our equipment  including di presses and ctp devices  as well as imaging kits  which are incorporated by leading press manufacturers into direct imaging presses for the graphic arts industry  ii the sale of high powered laser diodes for the graphic arts  defense and industrial sectors  iii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iv the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and ctp systems and related equipment 
our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  such as printing plates  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices 
our strategy to grow our consumables has two parts 
the first part is to increase the number of our di and ctp units in the field 
by increasing the number of consumable burning engines we expect to increase the demand for our consumables 
we rely on partnerships with press manufacturers such as ryobi limited  heidelberger druckmaschinen ag  or heidelberg  and koenig bower ag  or kba  to market printing presses and press solutions that use our proprietary consumables 
we also rely on distribution partners  such as eastman kodak to sell  distribute and service press systems and the related proprietary consumable products 
another method of growing the market for consumables is to develop consumables that can be imaged by non presstek devices 
in addition to expanding our base of our consumable burning engines  an element of our focus is to reach beyond our proprietary systems and penetrate the installed base of ctp devices in all market segments with our chemistry free and process free offerings 
the first step in executing this strategy was the launch of our non proprietary aurora chemistry free printing plate designed to be used with consumable burning engines manufactured by thermal ctp market leaders screen and kodak 
we continue to work with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances our ability to expand and control our business 
we operate and report on a or week  fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the financial reports for the week fiscal year ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  the week fiscal year ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  and the week fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is presented together with results of operations by business segment 
results of operations results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue were as follows in thousands of dollars fiscal year ended december  december  january  of revenue of revenue of revenue revenue product service and parts total revenue cost of revenue product service and parts total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  marketing and customer support general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring and other charges credits total operating expenses operating income interest and other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income operating results related to the precision analog newspaper business have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue consolidated revenue consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal equipment revenues increased million over fiscal resulting from strong di unit sales  including the introduction of the new di press 
partially offsetting increases in equipment revenue was a decline in both consumables and service revenues million each driven principally from a continuing slowdown in analog sales 
consistent with our strategy of migrating our customer base to digital solutions  digital product sales improved from million in to million in  an increase of year over year 
as a percentage of total product revenues  sales of digital solutions increased from approximately in to approximately in equipment revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
growth in equipment revenues was due primarily to a increase in the number of di presses sold in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven largely by growth in our di product sales and the introduction of the new di press 
total di equipment sales were strong in both the north american and european markets during  as revenues improved by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
fiscal equipment revenues were also favorably impacted by the launch of a new generation ctp system  the vector tx  in the fourth quarter of the vector tx accounted for million of revenue in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal offsetting these items were lower dpm and dimension sales  which declined by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
sales of these units were impacted by competitive pressures  as well as quality issues on both equipment units and related consumable plates anthempro 
analog equipment revenues also declined from million in to million in this decline reflects the transition of our customer base from analog to digital solutions  however  we do anticipate that sales of analog solutions will level off and stabilize as a percentage of our total revenue in the near term 
overall  digital equipment sales in the presstek segment increased from million in to million in on a consolidated basis  digital sales as a percentage of total equipment revenues in accounted for of sales compared to in revenue for the lasertel segment of million in represented a year over year increase of  or million  due primarily to the addition of two new customers  as well as higher sales to the presstek segment 
revenues generated from consumables sales decreased year over year  from million in to million in the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to the anticipated slowdown in the analog market resulting from the continued migration of our customer base from analog to digital solutions 
total analog consumables sales declined from million in to million in  a decrease of 
partially offsetting this decline were improved sales of digital products  which increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased placements of di and ctp equipment and strengthening relationships with oem partners 
these increases were partially offset by declines in older technology digital lines such as dpm consumables 
overall  digital sales of consumables products increased million year over year  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total consumables revenues  digital sales accounted for of sales in compared to in service and parts revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease in revenue was due primarily to the elimination of certain legacy service contracts  as well as a reduction in billable service and analog parts sales as our customer base continues to migrate to digital solutions 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased product revenues year over year 
in addition  presstek recorded million of incremental warranty costs related to the vector tx and anthempro plate quality issues experienced during consolidated cost of service and parts revenues was million in fiscal  slightly lower than the million reported in these amounts represent the costs of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
costs in were impacted by higher fuel expenses  as well as increased technology costs related to an upgrade of the communications and logistics capabilities of our service technicians and engineers 
these costs were offset by the termination of service personnel in north america and the use of independent service contractors during the second half of  the result of a restructuring plan intended to realign our service costs with a declining analog revenue base 
gross margin consolidated gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was in compared to in gross margin as a percentage of product revenue was compared to in the product gross margin decrease reflects a heavier mix of equipment revenues as a percentage of total sales  which historically carry significantly lower margins than presstek s consumables line of products  increased warranty costs related to quality issues experienced with our vector tx and anthempro plates  partially offset by improved margins in our lasertel segment 
gross margin as a percentage of service and parts revenues decreased from in to in the decrease in margin percentage is principally due to a decline in the analog contract revenue base  which despite restructuring action taken to realign fixed service delivery costs in the second half of  negatively impacted margins 
we are currently working to transition our legacy analog service contracts to a time and materials model which  in the short term  due to fixed price arrangements on these contracts  has exerted additional downward pressure on our service margins 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses for personnel  parts and supplies  and contracted services required to conduct our equipment  consumables and laser diode development efforts 
consolidated research and development expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is principally attributable to efficiencies realized from the integration of the acquired abdick business into the company during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses for the presstek segment were million in  a decrease of million compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to efficiencies realized from the integration of the abdick business into this segment 
research and development expenses for the lasertel segment were million in compared to million in the increase reflects increased development costs associated with specialized new products for third party foreign customers 
sales  marketing and customer support sales  marketing and customer support expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses for personnel  advertising  trade shows  promotional expenses  and travel costs associated with sales  marketing and customer support activities 
to improve operations  we took steps in both fiscal and to strengthen capacity and capability within the sales  marketing and customer support area through reorganization  training in advanced technology products and services  and changes in key personnel 
we also eliminated costs  primarily for customer support and marketing personnel by integrating us marketing and customer support operations within the presstek segment 
as we continue to pursue initiatives designed to drive penetration of presstek technology in the marketplace  we expect expenses in this area to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
consolidated sales  marketing and customer support expenses of million in fiscal were relatively unchanged from expenses of million in fiscal sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the presstek segment were million and million in and  respectively 
sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the lasertel segment increased from million in to million in general and administrative consolidated general and administrative expenses  primarily comprised of payroll and related expenses for personnel  and contracted professional services necessary to conduct our finance  information systems  human resources and administrative activities  were million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to cost savings realized by the integration of the abdick us operations into presstek 
as a percentage of total sales  consolidated general and administrative expenses declined from in to in we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods  as our strategy is to position the growth of general and administrative expenses at lower rates than the growth of revenue and as the impact of integration actions is fully realized 
general and administrative expenses for the presstek segment were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in expense is primarily attributable to the elimination of redundant costs resulting from the integration of the abdick us operations into the segment 
general and administrative expenses for the lasertel segment increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a change in allowance for doubtful accounts arising from certain customer accounts 
amortization of intangible assets intangible asset amortization expense increased from million in to million in amortization relates to intangible assets recorded in connection with the company s abdick and precision acquisitions  patents and other purchased intangible assets 
restructuring and other charges credits in fiscal  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million 
these charges included million related to impairment of intangible assets associated with patent defense costs on the creo litigation matter  million related to impairment of goodwill resulting from sfas valuation adjustments of long lived assets at precision as a result of the decision to discontinue its newspaper analog business  million for merger related costs primarily related to additional professional fees  and million related to the impairment of other assets 
in addition  approximately million of previously established accruals at the presstek segment were recognized in income in fiscal due principally to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs 
in fiscal  we recognized million of restructuring and other charges related to precision and abdick 
these charges included severance and fringe benefit costs  executive and other contractual obligations  and a settlement with previously terminated employees 
interest and other income expense  net net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in the current year period is attributable to lower outstanding long term debt resulting from the repayments of principal 
on september   an agreement related to the abdick acquisition under which we were reimbursed million was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
the net amount  after reductions for legal fees and additional adjustments for settlement of various assets and liabilities related to this action  totaled million  and is included as a component of interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the balance of other income expense  net relates to gains or losses on foreign currency transactions for all periods presented 
provision benefit for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the variance from the federal statutory rate for fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets in the us the variance from the federal statutory rate for fiscal was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses previously offset by a valuation allowance  foreign taxes  and alternative minimum taxes 
in fiscal  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  the company recognized through its tax provision a million deferred tax benefit from the reversal of the previously recorded valuation allowance established on its us federal  state and local deferred tax assets  except for that portion where the evidence does not yet support a reversal 
to support the determination that is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized in the future  fas requires that the company consider all available positive and negative evidence 
based on a detailed analysis conducted during fiscal  the company concluded that evidence exists to support the us valuation allowance reversal as of december  during  we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory federal and state tax rates 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue consolidated revenue consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million of consolidated revenues in fiscal revenue growth in fiscal reflects the impact of our acquisition strategy launched in with the precision and abdick acquisitions and our success in integrating these operations into our business in we grew our digital technology base significantly in fiscal  with digital product revenues increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
product equipment revenues  including royalties  were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the fiscal increase is primarily attributable to the abdick acquisition  which business s direct sales channel favorably impacted our installed base of di and ctp presses  referred to as consumable burning engines  or cbes  sold in the current period

in addition  we entered into several strategic consumable relationships  including those with heidleberg naming the quickmaster di as a preferred plate and screen usa to market consumable plate products in non presstek proprietary ctp systems 
in fiscal  we brought back to presstek the previously outsourced service of our digital equipment and introduced di training to service engineers and customer support to drive digital service growth 
our digital service contract mix increased from to in fiscal lasertel segment revenue for the lasertel segment was million in both fiscal and fiscal revenue earned from external customers increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of two significant new customers in the defense and industrial fields 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of revenue consolidated cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to additional cost of product associated with the precision and abdick businesses acquisitions and higher revenues in fiscal consolidated cost of service and parts was million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts represent the costs of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
these increases are attributable primarily to the addition of the abdick business in november segment cost of revenue cost of revenue for the presstek segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million  compared to million in fiscal the increase relates primarily to the addition of abdick and higher production costs driven by increased equipment  consumable and parts sales 
cost of revenue for the lasertel segment was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal relates to production efficiency gains  yield improvements  and  to a lesser extent  a change in the lives of certain machinery and equipment from five to seven years  resulting in a reduction of depreciation costs of million in both the fourth quarter and fiscal this change in estimate positively impacted net income by million and earnings per share on both a basic and diluted basis by in both the fiscal fourth quarter and year 
consolidated gross margin consolidated gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of product revenue was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the product gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal is primarily the result of the addition of the precision and abdick businesses  together with a higher mix of equipment revenues  which historically carry lower gross margins than presstek s core business 
gross margin as a percentage of service and parts revenue was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the service and parts gross margin percentage increase in fiscal is attributable to integration savings resulting from consolidating operations and a shift from an outsourced service provider to internal services

our current senior secured credit facilities  referred to as the facilities  include a million five year secured term loan  referred to as the term loan  and a million five year secured revolving line of credit  referred to as the revolver  which replaced our then existing term loan and revolver entered into in october at december   we had million outstanding under letters of credit  thereby reducing the amount available under the revolver to million 
at december  and december   the interest rates on the outstanding balance of the revolver were and  respectively 
principal payments on the term loan are made in consecutive quarterly installments of million  with a final settlement of all remaining principal and unpaid interest on november  the facilities were used to partially finance the acquisition of the business of abdick  and are available for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facilities bear interest at either i the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus applicable margins or ii the prime rate  as defined in the agreement  plus applicable margins 
the applicable margins range from to for libor  or up to for the prime rate  based on certain financial performance 
at december  and december   the effective interest rates on the term loan were and  respectively 
under the terms of the revolver and term loan  we are required to meet various financial covenants on a quarterly and annual basis  including maximum funded debt to ebitda  a non us gaap measurement that we define as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and restructuring and other charges credits  and minimum fixed charge coverage covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with its lenders in october  which were intended to protect the company s long term debt against fluctuations in libor rates

the agreement provides for total royalty payments to be no less than million and not greater than million over the life of the agreement 
as of december   the company had paid fuji million related to this agreement 
we currently expect future sales volume to be sufficient to satisfy minimum commitments under the agreement 
in the event of a volume shortfall over the term of the agreement  we are obligated to fund the shortfall as a lump sum payment 
were such lump sum payment required  we do not believe the amount of the payment will be material 
we have employment agreements with certain of our employees  some of which include change of control agreements that provide them with benefits should their employment with us be terminated other than for cause or their disability or death  or if they resign for good reason  as defined in these agreements  within a certain period of time from the date of any change of control of us 
from time to time we have engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  we may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  we may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  we would  under these arrangements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price a shortfall payment 
the maximum contingent obligation under these shortfall payment arrangements is estimated to be million at december  as of december   there were no defaults by ultimate lessees 
effect of inflation inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes totaling million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for us federal tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent that net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions result in reduction of current taxes payable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the future if the company experiences an ownership change  as defined by the internal revenue code 
an ownership change occurs when the ownership percentage of or greater of stockholders changes by more than over a three year period 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of reported revenue and expenses during the period 
management believes the most judgmental estimates include those related to product returns  warranty obligations  allowances for doubtful accounts  slow moving and obsolete inventories  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and deferred tax assets  stock based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other appropriate factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein

sales transactions financed with recourse clauses from time to time the company has engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  the company may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations

 accounting for leases sfas 
the long term portion of financing receivables is included in other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms  carried at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and adjusts for potential credit losses when it determines that receivables are at risk for collection based upon the length of time receivables are outstanding  past transaction history and various other criteria 
receivables are written off against reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectible 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated market value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
acquisitions in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined and recorded as of the date of the acquisition 
the company utilizes an independent valuation specialist to determine the fair values of identifiable intangible assets acquired in order to determine the portion of the purchase price allocable to these assets 
costs to acquire the business  including transaction costs  are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
as part the allocation of purchase price  the company records liabilities  including lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
throughout the allocation period  these accruals are reviewed and adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions 
goodwill and intangible assets presstek has goodwill and net intangible assets of million at december  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the goodwill provisions of sfas intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable  the company will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax operating cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
the company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return of the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
judgment is also required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in the models and valuation reports 
to the extent these future projections and estimates change  the estimated amounts of impairment could differ from current estimates 
patents represent the cost of preparing and filing applications to patent the company s proprietary technologies  in addition to certain patent and license rights obtained in the company s acquisitions or other related transactions 
such costs are amortized over a period ranging from five to seven years  beginning on the date the patents or rights are issued or acquired 
from time to time  the company enters into agreements with third parties under which the party will design and prototype a product incorporating presstek products and technology 
the capitalized costs associated with rights or intellectual property under these agreements will be amortized over the estimated sales life cycle and future cash flows of the product 
the company does not amortize capitalized costs related to either patents or purchased intellectual property until the respective asset has been placed into service 
the company amortizes license agreements and loan origination fees over the term of the respective agreement 
the amortizable lives of the company s other intangible assets are as follows trade names years customer relationships years software licenses years non compete covenants years accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the asset and liability approach underlying sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets for amounts if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we monitor the realization of our deferred tax assets based on changes in circumstances  for example  recurring periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations 
our income tax provisions and our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and estimates 
the company does not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries  which the company considers to be permanently reinvested

off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  commodity price risk  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has established procedures to manage its fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our long term borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held at the end of fiscal commodity price movements create a market risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials 
the company purchases aluminum for use in manufacturing consumables products and is embedded in certain components we purchase from major suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with certain suppliers to manage price risks within a specified range of prices  however  our suppliers generally pass on significant commodity price changes to us in the form of revised prices on future purchases 
in general  the company has not used commodity forward or option contracts to manage this market risk 
the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada and europe and is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
presstek routinely evaluates whether the foreign exchange risk associated with its foreign currency exposures acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency 
in general  the company does not hedge the net assets or net income of its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  certain key customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these parties may be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  certain major suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the united states dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
