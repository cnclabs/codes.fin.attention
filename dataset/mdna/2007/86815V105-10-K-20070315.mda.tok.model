item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we currently manufacture a portfolio of wire and cable products grouped into the following segments i our communications cable segment  ii our north american magnet wire and distribution segment  which includes our operation in china  iii our european magnet wire and distribution segment and iv our copper rod segment 
segment and geographical financial data for the years ended december   and are included in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
overview copper is the primary raw material we use in the manufacture of our wire and cable products 
foreign economies have been consuming an increasing proportion of worldwide copper production 
this and other macro economic factors have contributed to extremely high and volatile copper prices and periodic shortages of supply of copper 
see risk factors risks to our business related to copper 
our results for were significantly impacted by the movement in copper prices during the year 
we estimate that our gross profit was positively impacted by approximately million related to the upward volatility of copper prices during as further discussed below 
however  we believe high copper prices had a negative impact on sales in our communications cable segment as high copper prices eroded full year customer budgetary procurement limits during the fourth quarter of the high level of copper prices has significantly increased our working capital necessary to finance inventory and receivables 
we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility in april to increase our available credit to meet our increasing working capital needs 
in june and july of we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock and used the net proceeds of approximately million to pay down borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
however  there is no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate the impact of rising or volatile copper prices on our working capital 
our results for were also significantly impacted by a full year of operation of the businesses acquired in the essex nexans transaction in october in  the acquired entities contributed net sales of million on a copper adjusted basis  as described below  gross profit of million and operating income of million compared with total net sales of million million on a copper adjusted basis  gross profit of million and an operating loss of million for results of operations in discussing our results of operations below  we present supplemental net sales information adjusted to a constant lb comex cost of copper  or copper adjusted net sales  and copper adjusted gross profit margin gross profit divided by copper adjusted net sales which are a financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance  financial position or cash flows that i excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations  balance sheet or statement of cash flows  or ii includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
we believe sales adjusted for a constant cost of copper and copper adjusted gross profit margin are useful measures to aid in analyzing period to period net sales and gross profit margins  particularly in periods of changing copper prices 
copper adjusted net sales has distinct limitations as compared to gaap net sales 
by copper adjusting net sales  in a declining copper cost environment  it may not be apparent that net sales are declining on an actual basis 
furthermore  by copper adjusting gross profit margins in a rising copper cost environment  it may not be apparent the gross profit margins are declining on an actual basis 
management compensates for these limitations by using the gaap results in conjunction with copper adjusted net sales and gross profit margins 
net sales adjusted for a constant cost of copper and copper adjusted gross profit margin as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table provides net sales and supplemental copper adjusted sales information for the year ended december  and actual copper adjusted year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands in thousands net sales communications cable north american magnet wire and distribution european magnet wire and distribution copper rod constant cost of copper adjustment total average daily comex price per pound of copper comparisons are not meaningful due to the inclusion of entities acquired in the essex nexans transaction for periods subsequent to october  consolidated sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of as compared to consolidated sales of  million for the year ended december  sales for were significantly impacted by the increase in copper prices and the effects of the essex nexans transaction 
sales adjusted for a constant cost of copper increased for the year ended december  compared to the increase in sales in our european magnet wire and distribution segment attributable to the entities acquired in the essex nexans transaction amounted to million million on a copper adjusted basis for the year ended december  the impact of the essex nexans transaction was to increase consolidated net sales and copper adjusted sales by and  respectively 
the remaining decrease in consolidated copper adjusted sales is due to volume decreases in both the communications cable and copper rod segments partially offset by increased copper adjusted sales for our north american magnet wire and distribution segment 
sales for our communications cable segment for year ended december  were million  an increase of  as compared to sales of million for the year ended december  sales adjusted for a constant cost of copper decreased 
the copper adjusted decrease is primarily attributable to declines in copper osp unit volume attributable to overall decreases in market related demand  reductions in telephone company customer spending due to the impact of higher copper costs on budgetary limits and procurement restrictions due to delays in the merger of bell south and at t  two of the segment s largest customers 
these negative volume factors were partially offset by price increases in our copper osp products  primarily related to non copper price adjustments with respect to our contract and distribution customers  as well as volume and price increases in premises wire 
we believe the increase in premises wire volume is primarily due to an increase in our market share 
sales for our north american magnet wire and distribution segment were  million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared to the prior year 
on a copper adjusted basis  sales for the year ended december  increased from the prior year 
the copper adjusted increase results primarily from the current year impact of market share gains at certain major customers as well as strength in our industrial motor  transformer and generator end markets 
additionally  sales for the year ended december  include some benefit from product price improvement and price surcharges 
these increases were offset somewhat by reduced demand in the automotive  hvac and appliance end markets 
sales for the european magnet wire and distribution segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
on a copper adjusted basis  sales increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
the increase was largely attributable to the essex nexans transaction 
sales for include million million on a copper adjusted basis related to the entities acquired in the essex nexans transaction in october as compared to million million on a copper adjusted basis for total sales for reflect  in addition to the acquisition impact  the stable to improving overall business and economic conditions in europe 
copper rod sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million for on a copper adjusted basis  sales for our copper rod segment decreased by for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the copper adjusted decrease in reflects the loss of a major customer in the first quarter of as well as decreased market demand due to weakness in the automotive and residential construction end markets 
copper rod segment sales consist of external sales of processed copper rod that cannot be used for internal production 
copper rod volumes fluctuate from period to period due to changes in internal consumption needs and external market conditions 
gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit was million  an increase of as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to copper adjusted gross profit margin improvements in our communications cable and north american magnet wire and distribution segments and an increase in gross profit of million attributable to the entities acquired in the essex nexans transaction 
the gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the gross profit margin declined as a result of increased copper prices 
gross profit margin on a copper adjusted basis was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in copper adjusted gross margin is attributable to improved product pricing and mix  particularly in our communications cable segment  improved margins in our european magnet wire and distribution segment as a result of gross profit contributions by the acquired entities  a million benefit from the liquidation of north american magnet wire and distribution lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years and estimated benefits of million related to the upward volatility in copper prices experienced during we estimate that slightly over one half of this copper related benefit was associated with our communications cable segment and the remainder was associated with our north american and european magnet wire and distribution segments 
the copper related benefit is due to lower copper cost flow through compared to product pricing  mark ups on the component of the product cost related to copper and the inverted forward pricing curve in the comex copper futures market experienced during much of which favorably impacted certain of our forward buying and hedging arrangements 
our communications cable and north american and european magnet wire and distribution segments all experienced improved copper adjusted gross margins for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   including the effects of the copper related benefit discussed above 
copper adjusted gross profit margin improvements for our north american magnet wire and distribution business for the year ended december  were partially offset by the negative impact of non copper cost increases related primarily to higher energy costs  freight costs and non copper raw materials and changes in product mix  in particular increased sales of lower margin aluminum products representing  to some degree  substitution for copper in response to the increase in copper prices 
we do not expect significant future copper related gross margin benefits in our communications cable segment and we expect future benefits in our north american and european magnet wire and distribution segments  if any  to be reduced from those achieved in if copper prices decrease significantly we may experience decreases in gross margins or operating losses

the warehouse was previously operated by the north american magnet wire and distribution segment 
during we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property  plant and equipment of our uk subsidiary 
we evaluated the long lived assets of our uk subsidiary for impairment as of march  after consideration of deterioration in the european magnet wire market in the first quarter of  the loss of a major customer in and negotiated reductions in the value ascribed to the uk net assets in connection with the essex nexans acquisition 
the impairment test was based on probability weighted estimated cash flows associated with such assets

the uk operation is included in the european magnet wire and distribution segment 
gain on sale of product line in march  we sold accounts receivable and inventory totaling approximately million together with related trademarks and service names constituting the business conducted by us under the us seal trade name for a total purchase price of million 
a gain of million was recognized on the sale 
in connection with the sale  we also signed a non exclusive distribution agreement to act as a distributor for certain of the us seal products for a period of five years 
we believe the expected revenues under the distribution agreement represent a significant continuation of the direct cash flows of the disposed us seal product line 
the us seal product line was included in the north american magnet wire and distribution segment and revenues and expenses associated with the distribution agreement continue to be reported in that segment 
operating income the following table sets forth information regarding our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and we measure our segment operating performance based primarily on segment operating income  excluding restructuring and other charges and asset impairments

the operating loss for our european magnet wire and distribution segment for the year ended december  primarily reflects the results of our uk magnet wire business which sustained negative gross margins for due to reduced sales volumes and pricing 
the copper rod segment s operating loss improved slightly for the year ended december  compared to as discussed above  copper rod sales allow for fixed cost recovery at gross profit margins that are generally intended to break even 
corporate and other charges consist primarily of corporate payroll and parent company costs  stock based compensation charges  corporate headquarters costs and corporate legal  audit and accounting fees and compliance costs

accordingly  income tax expense for reflects a benefit of approximately million attributable to this loss 
these benefits accounted for a reduction of in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  excluding these benefits was which differs from the us statutory rate of due to the effects of state taxes and a valuation allowance established with respect to operating losses incurred by our uk subsidiary 
the effective rate of differs from the us statutory rate of due primarily to the effects of state taxes and operating losses in china for which no benefit was provided  offset by the benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion and the manufacturing deduction and the favorable determination of deductibility with respect to certain prior year compensation amounts

copper prices increased rapidly during significant increases in the price of copper and the resultant increase in accounts receivable and  to a lesser degree  inventory  impacts our working capital funding requirements 
as discussed above  we have experienced significant increases in our working capital requirements in as a result of increases in copper prices 
we have amended our senior secured revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity in light of rising and volatile copper costs

f other long term obligations relate to the estimated funding of our defined benefit pension plans 
the estimated contributions to our defined benefit pension plan represent the minimum required contributions calculated primarily using an assumed rate of return on assets of and a current liability rate of 
g commodity purchase obligations consist of forward fixed price purchase commitments principally for copper cathode  and to a lesser degree  for aluminum and natural gas 
we enter into copper cathode purchase obligations to match the copper component of product pricing for outstanding customer orders 
we expect that all of these commodity purchases will be used in our normal manufacturing operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in the preparation of these financial statements  management makes judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of policies regarding lifo inventories  establishment of allowances for accounts receivable and inventories  long lived asset impairment  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and certain accrued expenses involve significant levels of judgments  estimates and complexity 
we utilize the last in first out lifo method of inventory accounting for the majority of our magnet wire and copper rod inventories 
under the lifo method  cost of sales reflects the current costs of magnet wire and copper rod inventories  while balance sheet inventories are valued at historical costs in the periods the lifo layers were created 
in periods of volatile copper prices  significant differences can arise between the replacement cost of copper inventories and the historic lifo cost 
if we were not able to recover the lifo value of our inventory at a profit in some future period when replacement costs are lower than the lifo value of our inventory  we would be required to take a charge to recognize in our income statement all or a portion of the higher lifo value of the inventory 
additionally  if lifo inventory quantities were reduced in a period when replacement costs were lower than the lifo value of the inventory  we would experience a decline in reported margins 
conversely  if lifo inventory quantities were reduced in a period when the replacement cost of the inventory exceeded the lifo value  we would experience an increase in reported margins 
allowances for discounts and sales incentives are made at the time of sale based on incentive programs available to the customer 
the cost of these programs depends on various factors including the timing of the sale and the volume of sales achieved by the customer 
we monitor these factors and revise the provisions when necessary 
our allowances for surplus and obsolete inventory are based on estimates of future sales and production 
changes in demand and product design can impact these estimates 
we periodically evaluate and update assumptions when assessing the adequacy of inventory allowances 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assumptions and estimates with respect to estimated future cash flows used in the evaluation of long lived assets are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is estimated it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
these estimates are based on projections of future income in certain tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
insurance reserves are provided for estimates of losses due to claims for worker s compensation and health insurance for which we are self insured subject to certain individual and aggregate limitations 
insurance reserves are established based on estimates of the ultimate value of incurred claims  which often have long periods of resolution 
ultimate claim values are estimated by application of various claim development methodologies to historical paid loss  incurred loss and claim count information 
we closely monitor the claims to maintain adequate reserves 
due to the level of judgment  complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved  actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements 
adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board the fasb ratified the consensus reached in eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf requires disclosure of a company s accounting policy with respect to taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer including  but not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
we present such taxes  primarily sales  use and value added taxes  on a net basis 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
interpretation no 
prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as establishes criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes 
the interpretation also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
interpretation no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  based on our preliminary evaluation  we expect implementation of interpretation no 
to result in the recognition of additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires an employer to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income for the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
sfas requires prospective application  and the recognition and disclosure requirements are effective for years ending after december  we implemented sfas as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  to a limited extent  use or have used forward fixed price contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for investment or trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counter parties for foreign exchange forward contracts  metal forward price contracts and metals futures contracts but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counter parties 
the amount of such exposure is generally limited to any unrealized gains within the underlying contracts 
commodity price risk management the costs of copper  our most significant raw material  and aluminum have historically been subject to considerable volatility 
to manage the risk associated with such volatility  we enter into futures purchase contracts to match the metal component of customer product pricing with the cost component of the inventory shipped 
these futures contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged sales transactions are reflected in the income statement 
hedge ineffectiveness  which is not significant  is immediately recognized in earnings 
our commodities futures purchase contracts designated as cash flow hedges are summarized as follows at december  type notional amount maturity date weighted average settlement rate fair value gain loss in thousands of pounds in thousands december  copper substantially all of the unrealized loss on commodity futures outstanding at december  is expected to be reclassified in earnings within the next twelve months to match the copper component of product pricing for outstanding customer orders 
essex nexans enters into commodity futures contracts to match the copper component of customer product pricing with the cost component of the inventory shipped 
the futures contracts are intended to minimize the risks associated with forward product pricing for customers and changing copper prices 
these contracts generally have maturities of less than two months and represent economic hedges but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income as a component of cost of goods sold 
there were no open positions as of december  interest rate risk management in order to limit our exposure to rising interest rates with respect to borrowings under our variable rate senior secured revolving credit facility  we have entered into interest rate cap agreements 
the following interest rate cap agreements were outstanding as of december  type notional amount interest rate cap rate expiration date fair value in thousands in thousands december  interest rate cap day libor april foreign currency exchange risk management we engage  to a limited extent  in the sale of products which result in accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations in the value of these receivables 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are reflected in current earnings 
at december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts to exchange million canadian dollars for million in january the fair value of the forward exchange contracts was insignificant at december  purchase commitments we accept certain customer orders for future delivery at fixed prices 
as copper is the most significant raw material used in the manufacturing process  we enter into forward fixed price purchase commitments for copper to properly match our cost to the value of the copper expected to be billed to customers 
at december   we had forward fixed price copper purchase commitments for delivery of million pounds through december for million 
additionally at december   we had forward purchase fixed price commitments for million pounds of aluminum through august and  mmbtus of natural gas through december amounting to million and million  respectively
