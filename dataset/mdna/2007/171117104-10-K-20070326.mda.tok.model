item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview beginning in the late s  the us furniture industry began undergoing a dramatic shift from a domestic manufacturing base to a highly competitive global supply chain 
global manufacturers  primarily in china and other asian countries  have used substantially lower labor costs and somewhat lower material costs to achieve a competitive advantage over us based manufacturers 
as a result  numerous us based manufacturing operations have been closed or have converted to alternative business models 
during  the company consolidated its sales management and the sales representation of its peters revington  chromcraft and silver furniture brands into one integrated sales organization 
recently  the company combined its remaining residential furniture brands to form a single sales force and appointed new senior management to lead the coordinated sales function 
the company also recently combined its various product development and marketing brand organizations and has started to coordinate its residential furniture brand marketing programs with new functional management 
in addition  the company implemented a restructuring program in that included the shut down  relocation  consolidation and outsourcing of certain furniture manufacturing and distribution operations 
the purposes of the restructuring were to improve the utilization of a global supply chain  to reduce fixed costs and to increase overall asset utilization 
these restructuring activities included the outsourcing of the company s sumter brand bedroom and dining room furniture that were produced at the sumter  sc facilities to contract manufacturers located primarily in china 
furniture manufacturing operations in sumter  sc were shut down on october   and the company is now distributing the sumter brand furniture consolidated with other products from its existing lincolnton  nc distribution facilities 
sumter s machinery and equipment were sold in  and its facilities are included in assets held for sale at december  the restructuring program also included the shut down of the company s warehouse and distribution center in knoxville  tn on december   which distributed silver brand occasional furniture 
the silver brand occasional furniture products are now combined with the company s peters revington brand occasional furniture and distributed from existing facilities in delphi  in 
the knoxville  tn distribution center is included in assets held for sale at december  the restructuring activities also included the closure of the company s wood processing plant in warrenton  nc in december furniture parts production at this facility was outsourced to various suppliers or transferred to existing facilities in lincolnton  nc 
the warrenton  nc facilities  machinery and equipment are included in assets held for sale at december  the final component of the company s restructuring program was the relocation and consolidation of its upholstered furniture operations with other manufacturing operations located in lincolnton  nc 
the building that contained the upholstery operations is included in assets held for sale at december  as part of the restructuring program  associate positions will be eliminated and approximately one million square feet of manufacturing and warehousing space is held for sale at december  as a result of these restructuring activities  the company recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of  pre tax  or  after tax  representing a loss per share for the year ended december  the charge includes asset impairments of facilities  machinery and equipment of  pre tax  inventory write downs of  pre tax to reflect the anticipated net realizable value  one time termination benefits of  pre tax and costs to shut down  vacate and prepare for sale of  pre tax 
also  in connection with the restructuring the company recorded a non cash income tax charge of  or 
loss per share  to reflect the establishment of a valuation allowance and the reduction of a deferred income tax asset 
the company expects to incur additional costs of approximately  pre tax during the year ending december  for one time termination benefits  and costs to shut down  vacate  and prepare the company facilities held for sale in connection with the restructuring 
the company believes the restructuring activities are an important step in repositioning the company in the evolving furniture marketplace and in strengthening the company s ability to remain competitive 
these actions are expected to provide customers with better value  broader product selection and improved delivery services 
this strategic transformation of the company s business model involves a significant expansion of global sourcing activities  as well as a conversion of us operations toward an increased focus on distribution and logistics of imported products and a shift in its manufacturing operations toward use of demand flow and value added mass customization techniques 
as the company continues to adapt to the evolving furniture marketplace and integrate functions common to its various products  additional restructuring charges  asset impairments  transition costs  reduced revenues and increased operating expenses may occur

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the company requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the related footnotes 
chromcraft revington considers the following accounting policies to be most significantly impacted by the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collectability of trade receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on the company s analysis of customer credit worthiness  historical loss experience and general economic conditions and trends 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company evaluates its inventories for excess or slow moving items based on sales order activity and expected market changes 
if circumstances indicate the cost of inventories exceed their recoverable value  inventories are reduced to net realizable value 
employee related benefits accounting for self insured health care and workers compensation liabilities involves assumptions of expected claims based on past experience and a review of individual claims 
the company establishes a liability based on claim information supplied by insurance and third party administrators 
actual claim expense could differ from the estimates made by the company 
property  plant and equipment the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate the possibility that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that may trigger an impairment evaluation include under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the forecast of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value 
assets held for sale assets held for sale are long lived assets which are carried at the lower of their net book value or fair value and no longer depreciated 
fair value for buildings was determined from purchase offers or information obtained from real estate brokers 
fair value for machinery and equipment was based on auction sales  which were completed in recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no

 fair value measurements fas  which is effective prospectively for the fiscal year beginning after november  fas provides a single authoritative definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosure about fair value measurements
