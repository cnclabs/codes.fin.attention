item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see important factors regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview in the five fiscal years ended september   we grew from stores to stores  representing a compound annual growth rate of  and increased our annual revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
in the same period  income from continuing operations has grown from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
from fiscal to the middle of fiscal  we experienced successive quarters of comparable store sales declines that reduced our average annual sales per store by over 
most of our store level expenses  such as rent and occupancy costs  are generally fixed in nature and they rose as a percentage of sales for these periods as these costs were being spread over a smaller average sales base 
in response  we began to initiate a series of management  operational and systems development changes in late fiscal intended to improve our merchandise assortments and enhance our execution in store 
our goal was to increase the average store volumes  re leverage our store rent and occupancy expenses and improve our financial performance  while investing in our infrastructure to support long term growth 
our comparable store sales trends improved in late fiscal and during each quarter of fiscal we experienced improved selling of apparel and accessories merchandise and achieved a comparable store sales increase of during fiscal  as compared to an increase of during fiscal as expected  the increase in our average store volumes improved our expense ratios and we achieved improved financial results in fiscal our comparable store sales trends continued to improve for the first three quarters of fiscal  growing  however  fourth quarter comparable sales declined driven by a slowdown in consumer spending and traffic consistent with weakness in the broader retail market 
the fourth quarter decline partially offset the increase of the first three quarters  resulting in a comparable store sales increase of for the fiscal year during fiscal  we improved our product margins by percentage points  driven by higher initial mark ups and lower markdowns 
these improvements were primarily due to improved product pricing  increased import penetration and successful inventory management  including utilization of our new markdown optimization software 
our operating margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the existence of a rd week in fiscal was responsible for percentage points  or almost  of the reduction 
the remainder of the decline was due to the growth in expenses outpacing the comparable stores sales increase 
we generally target a comparable store sales increase in order to leverage our operating expenses such as store payroll  rent and occupancy and other store operating expenses 
in addition  in fiscal  we made infrastructure investments to further improve execution and support our long term growth objectives  including installation of a new point of sale system chainwide  implementation of new markdown optimization software and the launch of our new e commerce website 
these investments also contributed to the reduction in operating margin but  we believe  position us to continue to improve operating productivity  enhance customer service and support our growth strategies 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  closed stores and remodeled stores 
we continue to be committed to our store expansion plans and we are targeting to open approximately new stores in fiscal we use a number of key performance indicators to evaluate our business  including the following fiscal year weeks weeks weeks store count net sales growth comparable store sales increase average store sales in thousands gross margin operating margin diluted earnings per share from continuing operations cash and cash equivalents in millions our average store sales are based on the time weighted average of all charlotte russe stores open in the period 
fiscal was a week year 
adjusting out the extra week in fiscal  average store sales would be  per store 
discontinued operations we acquired the rampage chain in fiscal as an additional growth vehicle for our company that would target young women seeking contemporary fashion assortments 
while this business was successful and profitable through fiscal  the business trends turned negative and we experienced operating losses from these stores during fiscal and thereafter 
our effort to reposition these stores to more effectively compete with other aspirationally branded retailers  despite some modest success in fiscal  was not financially successful 
based upon a review of the carrying value of the long lived assets of the rampage stores compared with the estimated future discounted and non discounted cash flows from their operations  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal this charge represented a write down of substantially all of the carrying value of the rampage long lived assets 
during the subsequent quarter  we completed an evaluation of the strategic alternatives for the rampage stores 
that review indicated that certain assets for a majority of the rampage stores could be sold based upon specific interest shown by other retailers  while the remaining stores could either be closed or converted to the charlotte russe format 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the lease rights  store fixtures and equipment associated with rampage store locations for approximately million 
of the remaining rampage stores in operation at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we converted eight stores into charlotte russe locations and returned properties back to their respective landlords prior to the end of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  and store information for the periods indicated 
fiscal year weeks weeks weeks net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income  net other charges  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations loss on discontinued operations net income fiscal year ended september  weeks compared to fiscal year ended september  weeks net sales 
our net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales from the new stores opened during fiscal as well as other stores opened in prior fiscal years that did not qualify as comparable stores 
this increase also benefited from a increase in comparable store sales  which resulted in additional sales  on a week basis  of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
offsetting these increases was the fact that  consistent with our fiscal year policy  fiscal included an extra week of business as the fiscal year end was reset at september  our net sales in included million of sales generated during this additional week in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in amount was primarily the result of higher net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from  or percentage points  from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to de leveraging of store rent and occupancy costs percentage point impact and slightly higher distribution center and buying expenses percentage point impact  partially offset by higher product margins percentage points primarily due to higher initial mark ups percentage point impact and lower markdowns percentage point impact  offset by other operating factors percentage point impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in amount was attributable to new store expansion and increased corporate expenses  including higher store payroll and operating expenses and higher central office payroll and related expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from  or percentage point  from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of net sales was principally due to an increase in store payroll expenses percentage point impact and store operating expenses percentage point impact and higher home office payroll and other expenses percentage point impact 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal of approximates our statutory income tax rate 
it is lower than the rate utilized in the prior fiscal year due to a favorable adjustment in fiscal to the prior year s stock based compensation tax benefit 
income from continuing operations 
our income from continuing operations decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the additional week included in our fiscal results due to the fiscal year calendar change 
our income from continuing operations included million of income generated during this additional week in fiscal when compared on a week basis  income from continuing operations increased million  primarily due to higher gross margins partially offset by the growth in operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
loss on discontinued operations 
as a result of their disposition  our rampage stores met the criteria in fiscal to be classified as discontinued operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
all of the stores were shut down in fiscal and all of the related financial impacts occurred in fiscal  therefore we had no profit or loss in fiscal from discontinued operations 
in fiscal the loss from discontinued operations was million 
fiscal year ended september  weeks compared to fiscal year ended september  weeks net sales 
our net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales  on a week basis  from the new stores opened during fiscal as well as other stores opened in prior fiscal years that did not qualify as comparable stores 
this increase also benefited from a increase in comparable store sales  which resulted in additional sales  on a week basis  of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
consistent with our fiscal year policy  fiscal included an extra week of business as the fiscal year end was reset at september  our net sales included million of sales generated during this additional week in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in amount was primarily the result of higher net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from  or percentage points  from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to leveraging of store rent and occupancy costs as these expenses were spread over a higher average store sales volume percentage point impact and improved distribution center expenses percentage point impact 
these favorable factors were partially offset by higher markdown expense percentage point impact and higher freight costs percentage point impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in amount was attributable to new store expansion and increased corporate expenses  including higher store payroll and operating expenses and higher central office payroll and related expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to from  or percentage points  from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of net sales was principally due to a reduction in store payroll expenses percentage point impact and store operating expenses percentage point impact  as many of these expenses were spread over a higher average store sales volume  lower home office payroll expenses percentage point impact and the costs for the settlement of two class action lawsuits in the prior fiscal year percentage point impact 
these favorable factors were partially offset by stock based compensation expense that was initiated in fiscal  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r percentage point impact and achievement of the management bonus plan performance targets for which no similar amount was recorded in the prior year percentage point impact 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal of approximates our statutory income tax rate 
it is higher than the rate utilized in the prior fiscal year as we adjusted our tax liabilities in fiscal to reflect the reassessment of tax contingency balances 
income from continuing operations 
our income from continuing operations increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit which was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and income taxes 
loss on discontinued operations 
as a result of their disposition  our rampage stores met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
our net loss increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to higher store operating losses as our efforts to reposition the rampage stores proved unsuccessful 
the fiscal results included a million pre tax impairment charge in the second quarter which was offset by a million pre tax gain on the asset dispositions in the fourth quarter 
quarterly results and seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by strong sales during the back to school  easter and winter holiday seasons 
the strength of each of these three seasons generally provides relatively balanced sales during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays  as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended september  this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that this information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that all necessary adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

our capital requirements result primarily from capital expenditures related to new store openings  store remodels and information technology expenditures 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
due to the rapid turnover of our inventory  we generate trade payables and other accrued liabilities sufficient to offset most of our working capital requirements  and this allows us to generally operate with limited working capital investment 
as of september   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and cash equivalents of million 
our short term investments have a weighted average maturity of less than days and are predominantly invested in money market instruments and obligations issued by the us treasury and foreign governments  commercial paper  and notes and bonds issued by us and foreign corporations with less than invested in asset backed securities 
the following chart provides a summary of our sources and uses of cash during the past three years 
fiscal year weeks weeks weeks dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities change in cash position in fiscal year  our net cash provided by operating activities decreased million over the prior year amount due to a million reduction in income from continuing operations  million increase in inventories  million increase to all other working capital accounts and million reduction in cash provided from discontinued operations as a result of disposing of the rampage assets in these unfavorable items were partially offset by a million increase in depreciation net of construction allowance amortization  a million increase in landlord construction allowances in fiscal and million of other factors  including stock based compensation expense and deferred rent charges 
net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of capital expenditures 
it increased million during fiscal as a result of increased capital spending associated with the implementation of our new point of sale system  the opening of new stores compared to new stores in fiscal  funding for remodeled stores compared to in fiscal and increased investments in our information systems and other corporate projects 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily consists of cash and income tax benefits associated with stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of  shares of our common stock and stock offering costs paid by us 
it decreased million in fiscal due to the repurchase of our common stock million  and a fewer number of stock option exercises during the fiscal year million  partially offset by stock offering costs  we incurred in related to costs of a registered offering in which shares were sold by two funds managed by apax partners  lp we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures to support our growth 
after taking into account new store construction  existing store remodeling and other corporate capital projects  total capital expenditures for fiscal are projected to range from approximately million to million 
we currently have a million secured revolving credit facility  referred to as the credit facility  with bank of america  na  which expires on june  under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit of million less any outstanding letters of credit  and we have set the initial loan ceiling amount at million 
interest on the credit facility is payable quarterly  at our option  at either i the bank s prime rate plus to or ii to over the average interest settlement rate for deposits in the london interbank market banks subject to certain adjustments 
our ability to receive loan advances under the credit facility is subject to our continued compliance with various covenants  representations and warranties  and conditions  including but not limited to negative covenants against the incurrence of debt or liens 
the credit facility also contains events of default customary for facilities of this type and provides that  upon the occurrence of an event of default  payment of all outstanding loans may be accelerated and or the lenders commitments may be terminated 
pursuant to this agreement  we and our wholly owned subsidiaries have i provided an unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of obligations under the credit facility  ii pledged certain of our securities to the collateral agent as security for the full payment and performance of our obligations under the credit facility and iii granted a security interest in essentially all of our personal property as security for the full payment and performance of our obligations under the credit facility 
at september   there was no outstanding debt under the credit facility and we were in compliance with the terms of the bank credit agreement 
as of september   we had million of borrowing availability under the credit facility 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  our current cash balance and the funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated capital expenditure requirements through fiscal if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital or to reduce planned new store openings and or store remodels 
contractual and commercial obligations our commitment to make future payments under long term contractual obligations and commercial obligations as of september  was as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands operating leases other obligations commercial obligations total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands documentary letters of credit standby letters of credit during fiscal  we sold lease rights for locations that were formerly operated as rampage stores to forever retail  inc  and its parent company guaranteed its obligations under the leases it assumed 
in the event of default  we could be liable for obligations associated with real estate leases which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately million through the end of fiscal which are not reflected in the tables above 
the scheduled future minimum rentals for these leases over the next four fiscal years and thereafter are million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of september  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
as a retailer of women s apparel and accessories  our financial statements are affected by several critical accounting policies  many of which affect management s use of estimates and judgments  as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments regarding revenues  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  stock based compensation  self insurance programs  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results from this evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  alternative estimates and judgments could be derived which would differ from the estimates being used by management 
actual results could differ from any or all of these estimates 
revenue we sell merchandise directly to retail customers and generally recognize revenue at the point of sale 
customers have the right to return merchandise to us  and we maintain a reserve for the financial impact of returns which occur subsequent to the current reporting period 
our policy with respect to gift cards is to record revenue as the gift cards are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to their redemption  unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a liability and are included within other current liabilities 
beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  we adjust the gift card liability balances on a quarterly basis to recognize estimated unredeemed amounts under the redemptive recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as additional sales on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on historical redemption trends 
such adjustments are included in net sales and operating income 
inventory our merchandise is initially offered for sale at a regular price  but is often marked down prior to the ultimate sale of all units that were purchased 
we utilize the retail method of accounting for our inventory valuation  which inherently reduces the carrying value of inventory as permanent markdowns are initiated 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for the financial impact of markdowns that we believe are likely to be encountered in the future 
if actual demand or market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by management  the level of the reserve for future markdowns would be subject to change in subsequent reporting periods 
we also provide for estimated inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory for the period from the last physical inventory to the financial statement date 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other factors 
we receive certain allowances from our vendors primarily related to distribution center handling expenses or defective merchandise 
these allowances are reflected as a reduction of merchandise inventory in the period they are received and allocated to cost of sales during the period in which the items were sold 
goodwill and long lived assets we have recorded a goodwill asset of million that arose from the acquisition of our business in september subsequent amortization of million reduced its carrying value to million 
this asset is tested for possible impairment on at least an annual basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  utilizing discounted cash flow valuation techniques and reference to the market value of our outstanding common stock 
no impairment adjustments have been required to date 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
upon determining that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
operating leases we record rent expense on non cancellable leases containing known future scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the respective leases beginning when we receive possession of the leased property for construction purposes 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is accounted for as deferred rent 
landlord construction allowances and other such lease incentives are recorded as deferred lease credits  and are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease as a reduction to rent expense 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing formula and a multiple option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life  price volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rate and expected dividend rate 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
self insurance liabilities based on our assessment of risk and cost efficiency  we self insure and purchase insurance policies to provide for workers compensation  employee group medical benefits  general liability  property losses and director s and officer s liability 
we estimate risks and record a liability based upon historical claim experience  insurance deductibles  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our risk assessments are appropriate  to the extent that future occurrences and claims differ from our historical experience  additional charges for insurance may be recorded in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since we anticipate that the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon audit  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements is incorporated by reference to note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september   on pages f and f item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  the credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of september   we had no borrowings against the credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under the credit facility as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we believe our market risk exposure is minimal
