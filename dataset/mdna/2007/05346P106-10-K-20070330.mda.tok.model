item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics 
our pipeline of drug candidates includes our lead candidate  avn avn is an oral  small molecule drug candidate currently in early stage clinical development for the treatment of hematologic cancers 
we seek to discover and develop novel therapeutics through the use of a comprehensive  innovative and proprietary suite of technologies based upon large scale gene expression analysis  which we call avalonrx 
since we commenced operations in january  our operations have consisted primarily of developing avalonrx  utilizing our technology to seek to discover and develop novel cancer therapeutics  and the in license and development of avn during that period  we have generated limited revenue from collaborative partners  and have had no revenue from product sales 
our operations have been funded principally through the offering of equity securities and debt financings 
we have never been profitable and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical testing and clinical trials and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability  and we may never do so 
financial operations overview revenue we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future 
to date  our revenue has consisted of collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue 
since inception  we have generated revenue solely in connection with our collaboration and pilot study agreements 
our collaborations with medimmune and novartis include upfront payments  research funding  and payments for the achievement of certain discovery and development related milestones 
during  we recognized revenue from our collaboration agreements with medimmune  novartis and the university of louisville 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates and supporting our collaborative relationships 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  the purchase of laboratory supplies  access to data sources  facility costs  costs for preclinical development and expenses related to our in license and clinical trials of avn we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our total research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  and million for the three months ended december  during  we incurred expenses of million related to the development of avn other than for our clinical candidate avn  we do not currently track our internal research and development costs or our personnel and related costs on an individual drug candidate basis 
we use our research and development resources  including employees and our drug discovery technology  across multiple drug development programs 
as a result  we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our research and development programs or our clinical and preclinical drug candidates 
during  we estimate that and of research and development expenses were attributable to research related to our catenin and aurora pathway programs  respectively 
we estimate that of research and development expenses were attributable to collaborations with medimmune  novartis and the university of louisville 
the remaining expenses included all personnel and related 
table of contents expenses and other research and development expenses not attributable to any specified discovery and development program 
prior to  we completed research related to developing and improving our ability to use avalonrx 
there were not substantial research costs related to specified programs prior to we begin to track development costs for a program after an individual molecule has been selected for formal pre clinical development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we advance avn through clinical trials and move other drug candidates into preclinical testing and clinical trials 
based on the results of our preclinical studies  we expect to selectively advance some drug candidates into clinical trials 
we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success and commercial potential 
in january  we initiated us phase i clinical trials of avn in cancer patients which are ongoing 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in administrative  finance  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  unallocated facility costs and professional fees for legal services 
during  we experienced increases in legal fees  accounting fees and directors and officers insurance premiums and fees for investor relations services 
quarterly results may fluctuate we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for several reasons  including the timing and extent of our development activities and clinical trials for avn and any other biopharmaceutical drug candidates that we may develop in the future  the timing and outcome of our applications for regulatory approval for our drug candidates  the timing and extent of our adding new employees and infrastructure  and the timing of any milestone payments  license fees  or royalty payments that we may be required to make 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our audited financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the performance period 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when milestones  as defined in the contract  are achieved 

table of contents accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue estimated liabilities include contract service fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical testing and legal and other professional services 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revised  or sfas r  share based payment sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and requires companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments  including those made pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method  which requires that stock based compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date as well as for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
prior to the adoption  we disclosed such costs on a pro forma basis in the notes to our financial statements 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  the financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of fas r 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expenses  of which million was included in research and development expense and million was included in general and administrative expense 
since we continue to operate in a net loss  the adoption of sfas r had no impact for tax related effects on cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities for the year ended december  as of december   unamortized stock based compensation expenses of approximately million remains to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we amortize stock based compensation expenses on a straight line ratable basis over the vesting period 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended december  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used under this model are as follows i expected term of years based on the simplified method for estimating the expected term of stock options  ii expected volatility of based on historical and peer volatility data  iii weighted average risk free interest rate of based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option  and iv expected dividend yield of zero percent 
in addition  under sfas r  the fair value of stock options granted is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
based on historical data  we calculated a annual forfeiture rate  which we believe is a reasonable assumption 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the same period estimates are revised 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock 
in addition  management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of 
table of contents share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  and which could materially impact our fair value determination 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in revenues was attributable to our collaboration agreements with medimmune  novartis and the university of louisville  all of which were initiated during research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion in the prior year period of an upfront payment of million for the in license of avn this decrease was offset by compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options  an increase in clinical trial costs related to our avn drug candidate and an increase in lab supplies expense related  in part  to collaboration and drug development programs 
research and development expenses consist of direct costs which include salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  and the costs of consultants  materials and supplies associated with research and development projects 
indirect research and development costs include facilities  depreciation  patents and other indirect overhead costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is attributable to compensation expense related to issuance of stock options  salaries and bonuses for new hires  increases in compensation to executives and staff  and other expenses from operating as a public company 
interest income 
interest income increased by  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest income is a result of interest earned on proceeds from the issuance of common stock  including proceeds from our initial public offering  and higher average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes into common stock at the close of our initial public offering in october  and lower balances on our long term debt 
this decrease was offset  in part  by higher average interest rates on our long term development bond financing 
other income 
other income decreased by  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the same period in the decrease in other income was primarily related to a decrease in shared services utilized by subtenants in our facility 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of revenue 
substantially all revenues are related to our collaboration agreement with medimmune  inc a small portion of revenue was attributable to collaborations with novartis and the university of louisville 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of revenue from our collaboration with sanofi aventis for work performed and milestones achieved during research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to for the twelve months ended december   from million for the same period in this increase was driven primarily by a million expense related to our licensing agreement with vertex pharmaceuticals and accrual of annual performance bonuses for research and development personnel 
no annual performance bonuses were accrued or paid during 
table of contents the largest components of our research and development expense  excluding the in license fee for avn  are personnel costs for our scientific staff  laboratory supplies  facility costs for our laboratories and the use of third party services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to the accrual of annual performance bonuses for general and administrative personnel and increases in outside accounting and professional fees 
these increases were offset  in part by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses 
the largest components of our general and administrative costs are personnel costs for our administrative staff  legal costs primarily attributed to our intellectual property protection activities  and travel

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements are to fund our research  development and clinical programs  obtain regulatory approvals  prosecute  defend and enforce any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  fund general corporate overhead  and support our debt service requirements and contractual obligations 
our cash requirements could change materially as a result of the progress of our research and development and clinical programs  licensing activities  acquisitions  divestitures or other corporate developments 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public stock offerings  private placement of equity securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and development funding  development milestones and investment income 
in evaluating alternative sources of financing we consider  among other things  the dilutive impact  if any  on our stockholders  the ability to leverage stockholder returns through debt financing  the particular terms and conditions of each alternative financing arrangement and our ability to service our obligations under such financing arrangements 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million  which is a decrease of million from december  of the million balance at the end of  million was held in a restricted account to serve as collateral for our long term debt 
our funds are currently invested in investment grade and united states government securities

credit arrangements in april  we entered into a series of agreements with the maryland industrial development financing authority  or midfa  and manufacturers and traders trust company  or m t bank  in order to finance improvements to our corporate office and research facility located in germantown  maryland 
midfa sold development bonds in the amount of million 
the proceeds of the bond sale were put in trust to reimburse us for the costs we incurred for improvements to our facility 
we are required to repay the trust million annually for these borrowings 
the borrowing bears interest at a variable rate and matures on april  the weighted average interest rate during and was and  respectively 
in connection with the development bond financing  we entered into an agreement with m t bank to issue the trustee an irrevocable letter of credit to provide payment of the principal and interest of the bonds 
the amount of the letter of credit changes annually  as principal payments are made 
as of december  and  the letter of credit amount was million consisting of million of principal and  in interest and million consisting of million of principal and  in interest  respectively 
the letter of credit expires the earlier of april   or the date the bonds have been paid in full 
in consideration of the letter of credit  we have granted m t bank a security interest in certain facility improvements  equipment and cash collateral held as restricted cash 
the company is in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the company s letter of credit 
in june  we entered into an equipment line of credit with general electric capital corporation ge capital that provided for borrowings of up to million 
in  the line of credit was increased to allow for an additional million in borrowings 
during and a total of million was borrowed by us under the equipment line of credit 
no draws have been made since and the availability of the line of credit has lapsed 
each draw has been treated as a separate promissory note bearing interest between and over to month terms 
the line of credit is secured by the applicable equipment  fixtures  and personal property financed by the line of credit 
in connection with draws under the line of credit  the lender received warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our series b preferred stock at an exercise price of  which subsequently automatically converted into warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with the closing of our initial public offering 
at december   roughly  in borrowings remained outstanding under this line of credit 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the size and complexity of our research and development programs  the scope and results of our preclinical testing and clinical trials  
table of contents continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the time and expense involved in seeking regulatory approvals  competing technological and market developments  acquisition  licensing and protection of intellectual property rights  and the cost of establishing manufacturing capabilities and conducting commercialization activities 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors likely will experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs 
in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our drug candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to our company 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating lease obligations cooperative research and development agreements total includes principal  interest and letter of credit fee payments on our development bond financing and principal and interest payments on our equipment financing 
our development bond financing carries a variable interest rate 
amounts presented in the table assume a fixed rate of that was in effect on december  the table does not include potential discounts for debt prepayment 
our operating lease obligations relate to the lease for our headquarters in germantown  maryland 
cooperative research and development agreements include commitments into which we have entered as of december  to engage third parties to perform various aspects of our research and development efforts subsequent to that date 
the table above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
accordingly  the table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  including our license with vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated for the development and commercialization of avn  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
we also have service agreements with clinical sites for the conduct of our us phase i clinical trial of avn in cancer patients 
we make payments to these sites based upon the actual number of patients enrolled and the period of follow up in the trials 
we do not have minimum payment obligations under these agreements and the amount to be paid to each center and the timing of those payments will vary based on the negotiated amount paid for each patient to be treated and for each patient screened who fails to or declines to participate in the clinical trial 
due to the variability associated with these agreements and the timing of patient enrollment  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future patient enrollment costs we will incur 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted statement r on january  see note to our audited financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities 
subsequent events on january   we sold  shares of our common stock to seventeen accredited institutional investors for a total purchase price of million 
we intend to use the proceeds from this offering to support our research and development activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million of obligations which were subject to variable rates of interest under our development bond financing with midfa 
if market interest rates increased from the rate at december   our annual interest expense would increase approximately  assuming that obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
in addition  the value of our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments is subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted cash of million as follows cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million long term investments million restricted cash million we maintain an investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes and corporate bonds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their predominantly short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment portfolio 
as of december   securities totaling million mature in the next months and million mature after december  while we do not believe that an increase in market rates of interest would have any significant negative impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flow and results of operations 
we have operated in the united states and all revenues to date have been received in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
