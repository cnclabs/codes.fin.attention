item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the results of operations  capital resources and liquidity presented in its accompanying consolidated financial statements for harleysville national corporation the corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiaries harleysville national bank the bank  hnc financial company and hnc reinsurance company 
the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
current performance does not guarantee  and may not be indicative of  similar performance in the future 
the information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the corporation s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes under item of this report on form k 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the corporation and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices with the financial services industry 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
in applying accounting policies and preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
judgments and assumptions required by management  which have  or could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations are considered critical accounting estimates 
the following is a summary of the policies the corporation recognizes as involving critical accounting estimates allowance for loan loss  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment  stock based compensation  unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale  and deferred taxes 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses  current and anticipated economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  borrowers perceived financial and management strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  the dependence on collateral  and the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required which may adversely affect the corporation s results of operations in the future 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the corporation employs general industry practices in evaluating the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation calculates the fair value using a combination of the following valuations deposit premiums based on market deals  current stock pricing tracking as a multiple of book value  discounted cash flow of earnings with a terminal value and market multiple of earnings 
management performed its annual review of goodwill at june  in accordance with sfas no 
and determined there was no impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation the corporation adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r on january  using the modified prospective application method of transition 
sfas r was issued by the fasb in december  requiring all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
the expense of the option is generally measured at fair value at the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
prior to january   the corporation followed sfas and apb with pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas had been applied 
effective january   the corporation recognizes compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards at january  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
for new grants awarded on or after january   the corporation has chosen to continue the use of the black scholes option pricing model as used under sfas to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant 
the corporation estimates the fair value of options under the black scholes model which takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option 
the corporation s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested 
in accordance with sfas r  the corporation estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered as compared to accounting for forfeitures as they occur under sfas the corporation recognizes compensation expense for new grants using the straight line method which recognizes compensation expense for shares vesting evenly over the period of vesting 
pro forma disclosures under sfas have been based upon the accrual method which treats each vesting tranche as a separate award and amortizes expense evenly prorated from grant date to vest date for each tranche 
unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers 
in developing these fair values  the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments 
debt securities available for sale are mostly comprised of mortgage backed securities as well as tax exempt municipal bonds and us government agency securities 
deferred taxes the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realizations are likely 
if management determines that the corporation may not be able to realize some or all of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable value 
the corporation has not substantively changed its application of the foregoing policies  and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques used as compared to prior periods 
financial overview the corporation achieved its st consecutive year of earnings growth and the nd consecutive year of dividend increases to shareholders during for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share were compared to for and basic earnings per share were for compared to in net income in was million compared to million in the year to date financial results include the favorable impact on operations from the acquisition of the cornerstone companies effective january  and the million after tax gain on the sale of the bank s honesdale branch during the fourth quarter of partially offset by lower net interest income due to the continued margin compression during the results also reflect the issuance of  shares of the corporation s common stock for a stock dividend payable september  all share and per share information has been restated to reflect this stock dividend 
the corporation s consolidated total assets were billion at december   an increase of or million over billion in total assets reported at december  this increase was primarily attributable to loan growth of million and an increase in cash and investments of million 
the growth in loans took place primarily in the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios 
the return on average shareholders equity was in compared to in the return on average assets was in compared to in the decrease in the annualized return on average shareholders equity during was primarily due to the retention of earnings 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased million  or  for the year ending december   over the prior year 
the decrease in net interest income for the year was mainly attributed to higher deposit and borrowing costs offset in part by higher loan and investment rates 
the net interest margin for was compared to for due to market conditions  deposit rates have increased more quickly than the loan rates have increased 
growth in average earning assets for was 
during  noninterest income rose million primarily attributed to wealth management income generated from the cornerstone companies acquisition in january  the million pre tax gain on the sale of the honesdale branch partially offset by the loss on sales of investment securities of  as compared to a gain of million during noninterest expense increased million mainly due to higher salary and benefits expense of million related to the cornerstone companies acquisition  higher staffing levels resulting from growth and increased incentives 
the quality of the loan portfolio is a key focus of the corporation 
nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans  net assets in foreclosure and loans days or more past due were 
of total assets at december   compared to

core deposits total deposits less time deposits increased  or million  to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  total deposits increased million  or  for the same period  which was primarily attributable to the growth in public fund interest checking products and time deposits 
on november   the bank completed the sale of its honesdale branch located in wayne county  pennsylvania with deposits of million  as well as loans and other assets of million to first national community bank 
in connection with the sale  the bank paid net cash of million and recorded a gain in the fourth quarter of  net of federal income taxes  of million or 
per diluted share 
the sale of this single wayne county location will allow the bank to focus on expanding within its core markets and also help to provide the resources required to support strategic initiatives

the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash paid at closing and a contingent payment of up to million to be paid post closing 
the contingent payment is based upon the cornerstone companies meeting certain minimum operating results during a five year earn out period with a maximum payout of million over this period 
for  the minimum operating results were met resulting in an earn out payment of million which was recorded as additional goodwill 
at december   the remaining maximum payout is million through on june   the bank sold its former subsidiary  cumberland advisors  inc  to david r 
kotok and associates  inc 
in a stock sale

investment securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that debt and equity securities classified as available for sale be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the net effect of unrealized gains or losses  caused by marking an available for sale portfolio to market  causes fluctuations in the level of shareholders equity and equity related financial ratios as market interest rates cause the fair value of fixed rate securities to fluctuate 
investment securities increased to million at december  from million at december  the investment securities available for sale increased million and the investment securities held to maturity decreased  during  million of securities available for sale were sold which generated a pre tax loss of  the securities sold consisted primarily of bullet and callable agency  tax exempt municipal and mortgage backed securities

loans loans increased million  or in  primarily attributed to growth in commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans 
the growth in commercial loans was mainly due to the emphasis on owner operated businesses and real estate loans in its primary market 
one of the bank s strategic objectives is to increase its loan to deposit ratio by growing its loan portfolio at a faster pace than its deposits 
the planned reduction in lease financing was due to run off and sales

the bank had no foreign loans  and the impact of nonaccrual and delinquent loans on total interest income was not material 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans that are in nonaccrual status or days or more past due and loans that are in the process of foreclosure 
a loan is generally classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest has consistently been in default for a period of days or more  when there has been deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  or payment in full of principal or interest is not expected 
delinquent loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and expected to be restored to a current status in the near future 
nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due and net assets in foreclosure were 
of total assets at december   compared to at december  and at december  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total net loans was at december   compared to at december  and at december  nonaccruing loans increased million to million at december   as compared to december  the higher level of nonaccruing loans was mainly due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans during three borrowers totaling million during the first quarter  one borrower for  in the second quarter and two borrowers totaling million during the fourth quarter 
nonaccruing loans increased million to million at december   in comparison to december  the increase in nonaccruing loans was primarily due to commercial mortgage loans for one borrower totaling million and commercial business loans for four borrowers totaling million which were placed on nonaccrual of interest 
the bank s policy for interest income recognition on nonaccrual loans is to recognize income under the cash basis when the loans are both current and the collateral on the loan is sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation to the bank 
the bank will not recognize income if these factors do not exist 
during  interest accrued on nonaccruing loans and not recognized as interest income was  and interest paid on nonaccruing loans of  was recognized as interest income 
during  interest accrued on nonaccruing loans and not recognized as interest income was  and interest paid on nonaccruing loans of  was recognized as interest income 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and are in the process of collection 
as of december   loans past due days or more and still accruing interest were million  compared to  at december  and  at december  the higher level of loans past due days or more at december  from december  was primarily in the real estate loan portfolio 
there were no net assets in foreclosure at december  the december  net assets in foreclosure balance of  decreased  from december  during  transfers from loans to assets in foreclosure were  disposals on foreclosed properties were  and charge offs of  were recorded 
efforts to liquidate assets acquired in foreclosure proceed as quickly as potential buyers can be located and legal constraints permit 
foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost lesser of carrying value of the asset or fair value at date of acquisition or estimated fair value

the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and management s intent with regard to the disposition of loans 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically reviews the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require the corporation to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on various independent methodologies 
the components of the allowance for credit losses consist of both historical losses and estimates 
management bases its recognition and estimation of each allowance component on certain observable data that it believes is the most reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated 
the observable data and accompanying analysis is directionally consistent  based upon trends  with the resulting component amount for the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses components includes the following historical loss estimation by loan product type and by risk rating within each product type  payment past due status  industry concentrations  internal and external variables such as economic conditions  credit policy and underwriting changes and results of the loan review process 
the corporation s historical loss component is the most significant component of the allowance for loan losses  and all other allowance components are based on the inherent loss attributes that management believes exist within the total portfolio that are not captured in the historical loss component 
the historical loss components of the allowance represent the results of analysis of historical charge offs and recoveries within pools of homogeneous loans  within each risk rating and broken down further by segment  within the portfolio 
criticized assets are further assessed based on trends  expressed as percentages  relative to delinquency  risk rating and non accrual  by credit product 
the historical loss components of the allowance for commercial loans are based principally on current risk ratings  historical loss rates adjusted  by adjusting the risk window  to reflect current events and conditions  as well as analysis of other factors that may have affected the collectibility of loans 
the corporation analyzes all commercial loans that have been identified as having potential credit risk 
the review is accomplished via watchlist memorandum  and is designed to determine whether such loans are individually impaired  with impairment measured by reference to the collateral coverage and or debt service coverage 
the historical loss component of the allowance for consumer loans is based principally on loan payment status  retail classification and historical loss rates  adjusted by altering the risk window  to reflect current events and conditions 
the industry concentration component is recognized as a possible factor in the estimation of loan losses 
two industries represent possible concentrations commercial real estate and consumer loans relying on residential home equity 
no specific loss related observable data is recognized by management currently  therefore no specific factor is calculated in the reserve solely for the impact of these concentrations  although management continues to carefully consider relevant data for possible future sources of observable data 
the historic loss model includes a judgmental component environmental factors that reflects management s belief that there are additional inherent credit losses based on loss attributes not adequately captured in the lagging indicators 
furthermore  given that past performance indicators may not adequately capture current risk levels  allowing for a real time adjustment enhances the validity of the loss recognition process 
there are many credit risk management reports that are synthesized by credit risk management staff to assess the direction of credit risk and its instant effect on losses 
it is important to continue to use experiential data to confirm risk as measurable losses will continue to manifest themselves at higher than normal levels even after the economic cycle has begun an upward swing and lagging indicators begin to show improvement 
the judgmental component is allocated to the specific segments of the portfolio based on the historic loss component 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  as compared to december  the increase in the allowance was primarily due to inherent risk related to loan growth and the increase in nonperforming loans of million

each of these major elements is reviewed in more detail in the following discussion 
net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis in decreased million  or to million  compared to the decrease in was mostly due to higher deposit rates  partially offset by higher loan rates and loan volume

the average yield on investments also increased basis points 
interest expense increased million  to million during mostly attributed to higher deposit and borrowing rates 
the average rate paid on deposits during of was basis points higher compared to primarily due to higher rates on money market accounts  interest checking accounts and time deposits accounts

as a result of market conditions  deposit rates have continued to increase more quickly than the loan rates have increased 
during  the corporation continued to manage its balance sheet in an effort to position it during the current rising rate scenario 
the corporation continued to sell securities with lower fixed rates and longer average lives in a rising rate and inverted yield curve environment and purchased securities with higher yields and more stable cash flows 
as a result  the balance sheet is better positioned to mitigate market risk

interest rate sensitivity analysis in the normal course of conducting business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risk  principally interest rate risk  through the operations of its banking subsidiary 
interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that affect cash flows  income  expense and value of financial instruments 
the corporation actively manages its interest rate sensitivity positions 
the objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve consistent growth in net interest income 
the asset liability committee  using policies and procedures approved by the corporation s board of directors  is responsible for managing the rate sensitivity position 
the corporation manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix and repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities through the management of its investment securities portfolio  its offering of loan and deposit terms and through borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the nature of the corporation s current operations is such that it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the corporation only utilizes derivative instruments for asset liability management 
these transactions involve both credit and market risk 
the notional amounts are amounts on which calculations and payments are based 
the notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures 
direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid  if any 
interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rate flows fixed and floating are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amounts on which the interest payments are based are not exchanged 
at december    the corporation had cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that have the effect of converting the rates on money market deposit accounts to a fixed rate cost of funds 
this strategy will cause the corporation to recognize  in a rising rate environment  a larger interest rate spread than it otherwise would have without the swaps in effect 
in addition  the corporation had cash flow hedges with a notional amount of million that have the effect of converting variable debt to a fixed rate 
for these swaps  the corporation recognized net interest income of  and  for the years ended december  and and estimates that for   will be recognized as an increase in net interest income 
these swaps mature in during the first quarter of  the corporation terminated a cash flow hedge with a notional value of million 
the gross loss related to the termination of this swap was  which was amortized through october in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for the years ended december  and  the corporation amortized into net interest income  and  respectively related to this swap 
periodically  the corporation may enter into fair value hedges to limit the exposure to changes in the fair value of loan assets 
the corporation has entered into fair value hedges with a notional amount of million with  of interest income recognized for the year ended december  these swaps mature in through at december   the corporation had swap agreements with a positive fair value of  and with a negative fair value of  at december   the swaps had a positive fair value of  there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized during  and the corporation uses three principal reports to measure interest rate risk asset liability simulation reports  gap analysis reports  and net interest margin reports 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  as measured by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december   is presented in the following table

for the corporation  tier capital is generally common stockholder s equity and retained earnings adjusted to exclude disallowed goodwill and identifiable intangibles as well as the inclusion of qualifying trust preferred securities 
tier capital for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses 
the risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing the components of capital by risk adjusted assets 
risk adjusted assets are determined by assigning credit risk weighting factors from to to various categories of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the minimum for the tier capital ratio is  and the total capital ratio tier plus tier capital divided by risk adjusted assets minimum is 
at december   the corporation s tier risk adjusted capital ratio was  and the total risk adjusted capital ratio was  both well above regulatory requirements 
the risk based capital ratios of the bank also exceeded regulatory requirements at the end of at december   the corporation s tier risk adjusted capital ratio was  and the total risk adjusted capital ratio was 
the lower risk based capital ratios of the corporation at december  compared to december  were mainly due to the decrease in tier capital from the additional disallowed goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the acquisition of the cornerstone companies during january to supplement the risk based capital adequacy guidelines  the federal reserve board frb established a leverage ratio guideline 
the leverage ratio consists of tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets  excluding goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
the minimum leverage ratio guideline is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well diversified risk  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and  in general  are considered top rated  strong banking organizations 
other banking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least or  depending upon their particular condition and growth plans 
higher leverage ratios could be required by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
the corporation s leverage ratios were and at december  and  respectively 
the lower leverage ratio of the corporation at december  was mainly due to an increase in average assets which included increases in average loans and average federal funds sold 
under fdic regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
to be considered adequately capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
an institution is deemed to be critically under capitalized if it has a tangible equity ratio of or less 
as of december   the bank is above the regulatory minimum guidelines and meets the criteria to be categorized as a well capitalized institution
