overview as a financial institution with a focus on traditional banking activities  the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans  investments  or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes 
the corporation s net income for increased million  or  from million in to million in diluted net income per share increased  or  from per share in to per share in in  the corporation realized a return on average assets of and a return on average tangible equity of  compared to and  respectively  in net income for increased million  or  from million in diluted net income per share for increased  or  from per share in the increase in net income was driven by a million  or  increase in net interest income after the provision for loan losses  primarily due to external growth through acquisitions  which contributed million to the increase 
also contributing to the increase was a million  or  increase in other income excluding securities gains  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
these items were offset by a million  or  increase in other expenses  also primarily due to acquisitions  and a million increase in income tax expense 
in  the corporation experienced a decline in net interest margin of basis points 
significant increases in loans and investments  due to both external and internal growth  were funded by higher cost certificates of deposits and short term borrowings  as opposed to lower cost core demand and savings accounts 
if loan demand continues to outpace the growth of core demand and savings accounts based upon the continuation of the current interest rate environment and price sensitivity of customers  then further compression of the net interest margin may occur 
the following summarizes some of the more significant factors that influenced the corporation s results 
interest rates changes in the interest rate environment can impact both the corporation s net interest income and its non interest income 
the term interest rate environment generally refers to both the level of interest rates and the shape of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve  which is a plot of the yields on treasury securities over various maturity terms 
typically  the shape of the yield curve is upward sloping  with longer term rates exceeding short term rates 
however  during  the yield curve was relatively flat  and at times  downward sloping  with minimal differences between long and short term rates  resulting in a negative impact to the corporation s net interest income and net interest margin 
floating rate loans  short term borrowings and savings and time deposit rates are generally influenced by short term rates 
during  the frb raised the federal funds rate four times  for a total increase of basis points since december   with the overnight borrowing  or federal funds  rate ending the year at 
the corporation s prime lending rate had a corresponding increase  from to  resulting in an increase in the rates on floating rate loans as well as the rates on new fixed rate loans 
more significantly  the increase in short term rates also resulted in increased funding costs  with short term borrowings immediately repricing to higher rates and deposit rates  although more discretionary  increasing due to competitive pressures 
additionally  as rates increased  customers shifted funds from lower rate core demand and savings accounts to fixed rate certificates of deposit in order to 
table of contents lock into higher rates 
as a result  the net interest margin was negatively impacted when compared to the prior year  as shown in the following table st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year to date with respect to longer term rates  the year treasury yield  which is a common benchmark for evaluating residential mortgage rates  increased to at december  as compared to at december  higher mortgage rates resulted in slower refinance activity and origination volumes and  therefore  lower net gains for the corporation on fixed rate residential mortgages  which are generally sold in the secondary market 
while absolute longer term rates increased  the basis point increase in the year treasury yield was significantly less than the basis point increase in short term rates  resulting in a flattened and  at times  downward sloping  yield curve during if rates continue to rise and the yield curve steepens  residential mortgage volume could decrease even further  resulting in a greater negative impact on non interest income  as gains on sales would decline 
the market risk section of management s discussion summarizes the expected impact of rate changes on net interest income 
acquisitions in february  the corporation acquired columbia bancorp columbia of columbia  maryland 
columbia was a billion bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was the columbia bank  which operates full service community banking offices and five retirement community offices in frederick  howard  montgomery  prince george s and baltimore counties and baltimore city 
in july  the corporation acquired svb financial services  inc svb of somerville  new jersey  a million bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was somerset valley bank 
period to period comparisons in the results of operations section of management s discussion are impacted by these acquisitions when results are compared to results for in comparison to were impacted by the acquisition of svb  resource bancshares corporation resource in april and first washington financialcorp first washington in december the discussion and tables within the results of operations section of management s discussion highlight the contributions of these acquisitions in addition to internal changes 
acquisitions have long been a supplement to the corporation s internal growth 
these recent acquisitions provide the opportunity for additional growth  as they have allowed the corporation s existing products and services to be sold in new markets 
the corporation s acquisition strategy focuses on high growth areas with strong market demographics and targets organizations that have a comparable corporate culture  strong performance and sound asset quality  among other factors 
under the corporation s super community banking philosophy  acquired organizations generally retain their status as separate legal entities  unless consolidation with an existing subsidiary bank is practical 
back office functions are generally consolidated to maximize efficiencies 
merger and acquisition activity in the financial services industry has been very competitive in recent years  as evidenced by the prices paid for certain acquisitions 
while the corporation has been an active acquirer  management is committed to basing its pricing on rational economic models 
management will continue to focus on generating growth in the most cost effective manner 
merger and acquisition activity has also impacted the corporation s capital and liquidity 
in order to complete acquisitions  the corporation implemented strategies to maintain appropriate levels of capital and to provide necessary cash resources 
see additional information in the liquidity section of management s discussion 
deposits and borrowings the corporation s interest bearing liabilities increased from to in order to fund acquisitions and loan growth 
during  the corporation experienced a shift from lower cost interest bearing demand and savings deposit accounts of total interest bearing liabilities in  compared to in to higher cost certificates of deposit and short term borrowings in  compared to in 
the shift to higher cost liabilities has contributed to the decline in net interest margin 
obtaining cost effective funding will continue to be a challenge for the corporation and the financial institutions industry in general 

table of contents asset quality asset quality refers to the underlying credit characteristics of borrowers and the likelihood that defaults on contractual loan payments will result in charge offs of account balances 
asset quality is generally a function of economic conditions  but can be managed through conservative underwriting and sound collection policies and procedures 
the corporation has been able to maintain strong asset quality through different economic cycles  attributable to its credit culture and underwriting policies 
this trend continued in with net charge offs to average loans decreasing from in to in non performing assets to total assets slightly increased to at december   from at december   however  this level is still relatively low in absolute terms 
while overall asset quality has remained strong  deterioration in quality of one or several significant accounts could have a detrimental impact on the ability of some to pay according to the terms of their loans 
in addition  rising interest rates could increase the total payments of borrowers and could have a negative impact on their ability to pay according to the terms of their loans 
finally  decreases in the values of underlying collateral as a result of market or economic conditions could negatively affect asset quality 
equity markets as disclosed in the market risk section of management s discussion  equity valuations can have an impact on the corporation s financial performance 
in particular  bank stocks account for a significant portion of the corporation s equity investment portfolio 
historically  gains on sales of these equities have been a recurring component of the corporation s earnings 
declines in bank stock portfolio values could have a detrimental impact on the corporation s ability to recognize gains in the future 

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the corporation s net income 
the ability to manage net interest income over changing interest rate and economic environments is important to the success of a financial institution 
growth in net interest income is generally dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin 
the market risk section of management s discussion provides additional information on the policies and procedures used by the corporation to manage net interest income

when interest accruals are discontinued  interest credited to income is reversed 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest becomes current or the loan is considered secured and in the process of collection 
certain loans  primarily adequately collateralized mortgage loans  that are determined to be sufficiently collateralized may continue to accrue interest after reaching days past due 
excluded from the amounts presented at december  were million in loans where possible credit problems of borrowers have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms

the increase was due primarily to the impact of a million loan  which the corporation placed on non accrual in october this loan was for a community reinvestment act project that had 
table of contents been delayed as a result of funding shortfalls 
the increase in accruing loans past due days or more was due to a number of factors  most significantly the timing of certain loan payments and the adequate collateralization of certain real estate mortgage loans 
in recent years  net charge offs approximated the amounts recorded for the provision for loan losses 
in  net charge offs were less than the provision for loan losses due to adjustments to the allowance for loan loss during the year based on application of the corporation s allowance methodology 
the provision for loan losses is determined by the allowance allocation process  whereby an estimated need is allocated to impaired loans as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  or to pools of loans under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allocation is based on risk factors  collateral levels  economic conditions and other relevant factors  as appropriate 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance  which was approximately at december  the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions that might exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable 
management believes such an unallocated allowance is reasonable and appropriate as the estimates used in the allocation process are inherently imprecise 
see additional disclosures in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies  in management s discussion 
management believes that the allowance balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards

the net unrealized loss on non equity available for sale investment securities decreased million to a net unrealized loss of million at december  from a net unrealized loss of million at december   generally due to changes in interest rates 
at december   equity securities consisted of fhlb and other government agency stock million  stocks of other financial institutions million and mutual funds million

management periodically sells bank stocks when  in its opinion  valuations and market conditions warrant such sales 
other assets cash and due from banks decreased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisition of columbia 
because of the daily fluctuations that result in the normal course of business  cash is more appropriately analyzed in terms of average balances 
on an average balance basis  cash and due from banks decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease resulted from a reduction in the level of cash reserves required to be held against deposit liabilities as transaction account balances decreased 
premises and equipment increased million  or  to million  which included million as a result of the acquisition of columbia

other assets increased million  or  to million  which included million as a result of the acquisition of columbia 
the remaining net increase was due primarily to an increase in accrued interest receivable  as both loan balances and interest rates increased  and an increase in the cash surrender value of the corporation s life insurance plans

short term borrowings  which consist mainly of federal funds purchased and customer cash management accounts  increased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisition of columbia 
the increase in was due to increases in customer cash management accounts  in the form of short term promissory notes and purchases of federal funds as loan growth outpaced deposit increases 
long term debt increased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisition of columbia  primarily due to an increase in fhlb advances to fund loan growth and investment purchases  as well as the corporation s issuance of million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures in january 
table of contents other liabilities other liabilities increased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisition of columbia 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued interest payable related to the increase in available rates and time deposit balances  the recognition of the corporation s underfunded defined benefit pension plan liability  as required by statement  and an increase in dividends payable to shareholders 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion  or of ending total assets  as of december  this growth was due primarily to net income of million and million of stock issued for the columbia acquisition  offset by million of dividends paid to shareholders 
the corporation periodically repurchases shares of its common stock under repurchase plans approved by the board of directors 
these repurchases have historically been through open market transactions and have complied with all regulatory restrictions on the timing and amount of such repurchases 
shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase program asr  which allows shares to be purchased immediately from an investment bank 
the investment bank  in turn  repurchases shares on the open market over a period that is determined by the average daily trading volume of the corporation s shares  among other factors 
shares repurchased have been added to treasury stock and are accounted for at cost 
these shares are periodically reissued for various corporate needs 
total treasury stock purchases were approximately million shares in  million shares in and million shares in included in these amounts are shares purchased under asr s  totaling million in and million in as of december   the corporation had a stock repurchase plan in place for million shares through june  through december   million shares had been repurchased under this plan 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations to third parties  by type  that were fixed and determinable at december  payments due in one year one to three to over five or less three years five years years total in thousands deposits with no stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term debt operating leases purchase obligations includes demand deposits and savings accounts  which can be withdrawn by customers at any time

variable obligations  such as those based on transaction volumes  are not included 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn

table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance and provision for loan losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the provision is the periodic charge to earnings  which is necessary to adjust the allowance to its proper balance 
on a quarterly basis  the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying loans for individual review under statement in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are rated less than satisfactory based upon the corporation s internal credit rating process 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  generally representing loans that management has placed on non accrual status 
for loans reviewed under statement  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies statement 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with sab the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
accounting for business combinations the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
it also requires assessing the existence of and  if necessary  assigning a value to certain intangible assets 
the remaining excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price is established as the value of securities issued for the acquisition  cash consideration paid and certain acquisition related expenses 
the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are typically established through appraisals  observable market values or discounted cash flows 
management has engaged independent third party valuation experts to assist in valuing certain assets  particularly intangibles 
other assets and liabilities are generally valued using the corporation s internal asset liability modeling system 
the assumptions used and the final valuations  whether prepared internally or by a third party  are reviewed by management 
due to the complexity of purchase accounting  final determinations of values can be time consuming and  occasionally  
table of contents amounts included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income are based on preliminary estimates of value 
goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense in the consolidated income statement 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during  and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges in the future 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an impairment test between annual tests is necessary 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unauthorized competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
the corporation has not performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the past three years as no such events have occurred 
however  such an interim test could be necessary in the future 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  for certain state net operating losses that are not expected to be recovered 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions  us government sponsored agency stocks and money market mutual funds 
the equity investments most susceptible to equity market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of million at december  gross unrealized gains in this portfolio were approximately million at december  although the carrying value of the financial institutions stocks accounted for only of the corporation s total assets  any unrealized gains in the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue could be materially impacted 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
the corporation has evaluated  based on existing accounting guidance  whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of  in   in and  in for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the risk of changes in the value of its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue could also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if securities markets contract  the corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the ability of the corporation to sell its brokerage services is dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a bi weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net interest income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 

table of contents the corporation s sources and uses of cash were discussed in general terms in the overview section of management s discussion 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of billion  compared to a net cash outflow of million in financing activities resulted in net cash proceeds of million in  compared to net cash proceeds of million in as net funds were provided by increases in time deposits and borrowings  outpacing repayments of long term debt and shareholder dividends 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings 
in january  the corporation purchased all of the common stock of a new delaware business trust  fulton capital trust i  which was formed for the purpose of issuing million of trust preferred securities at an effective rate of approximately 
in connection with this transaction the parent company issued million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to the trust 
these debentures carry the same rate and mature on february  in  the corporation issued million of ten year subordinated notes  which mature april  and carry a fixed rate of 
interest is paid semi annually 
in  the parent company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with an unaffiliated bank 
under the terms of the agreement  the parent company can borrow up to million with interest calculated at the one month london interbank offering rate libor plus 
the credit agreement requires the corporation to maintain certain financial ratios related to capital strength and earnings 
as of december   there was million borrowed against this line 
the corporation was in compliance with all required covenants under the credit agreement as of december  these borrowings  most notably the revolving line of credit agreement  supplement the liquidity available from subsidiaries through dividends and provide some flexibility in parent company cash management 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to remain well capitalized and to meet its cash needs 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets 
this compares to billion  or of total assets  at december  
table of contents the following tables present the expected maturities of investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal other securities total mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal other securities total collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of percent 
maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  amounts are based upon contractual maturities 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans  and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 

table of contents the following table presents the approximate contractual maturity and interest rate sensitivity of certain loan types  excluding consumer loans and leases  subject to changes in interest rates as of december  one one year through more than or less five years five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural floating rate fixed rate total real estate mortgage floating rate fixed rate total real estate construction floating rate fixed rate total from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
in addition  the corporation issues certificates of deposits in various denominations  including jumbo time deposits  repurchase agreements and short term borrowings as potential sources of liquidity 
contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional billion of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 

table of contents the following table provides information about the corporation s interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
the table presents expected cash flows and weighted average rates for each significant interest rate sensitive financial instrument  by expected maturity period dollars in thousands 
expected maturity period estimated beyond total fair value fixed rate loans average rate floating rate loans average rate fixed rate investments average rate floating rate investments average rate other interest earning assets average rate total average rate fixed rate deposits average rate floating rate deposits average rate fixed rate borrowings average rate floating rate borrowings average rate total average rate amounts are based on contractual payments and maturities  adjusted for estimated prepayments

amounts are based on contractual maturities of time deposits 
estimated based on history of deposit flows 
amounts are based on contractual maturities of debt instruments  adjusted for possible calls 
amounts include federal funds purchased  short term promissory notes  floating fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which mature in less than days  in addition to junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
floating rate loans include adjustable rate mortgages 
line of credit amounts are based on historical cash flows  with an average life of approximately years 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
fair market value adjustments related to acquisitions are not included in the preceding table 
in addition to the interest rate sensitive financial instruments included in the preceding table  the corporation also had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million as of december  these swaps were used to hedge certain long term fixed rate certificates of deposit 
the terms of the certificates of deposit and the interest rate swaps are similar and were committed to simultaneously 
under the terms of the swap agreements  the corporation is the fixed rate receiver and the floating rate payer generally tied to the three month libor  a common index used for setting rates between financial institutions 
the combination of 
table of contents the interest rate swaps and the issuance of the certificates of deposit generates long term floating rate funding for the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s weighted average receive and pay rates were and  respectively 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having non contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month gap to plus or minus of total earning assets 
the cumulative six month gap as of december  was negative 
the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities as of december  was 
simulation of net interest income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of short term interest rates with changes across the yield curve based upon industry projections 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income annual change rate shock in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock in interest rates 
as of december   the corporation was within policy limits for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as with any modeling system  the results of the static gap and simulation of net interest income and economic value of equity are a function of the assumptions and projections built into the model 
the actual behavior of the financial instruments could differ from these assumptions and projections
