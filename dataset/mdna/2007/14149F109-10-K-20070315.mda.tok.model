overview we are a locally managed financial holding company headquartered in tysons corner  virginia  committed to providing superior customer service  a diversified mix of financial products and services  and convenient banking to our retail and business consumers 
we own cardinal bank the bank  a virginia state chartered community bank  cardinal wealth services  inc cws  an investment services subsidiary  and wilson bennett capital management  inc wilson bennett  an asset management firm acquired in june through these three subsidiaries and george mason mortgage  llc george mason  a mortgage banking subsidiary of the bank  we offer a wide range of traditional banking products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors  commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals  such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
we have branch office locations and seven mortgage banking office locations and provide competitive products and services 
we complement our core banking operations by offering a full range of investment products and services to our customers through our third party brokerage relationship with raymond james financial services  inc and asset management services through wilson bennett 
on june   we acquired wilson bennett for a total consideration of million  which consisted of a payment of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of our common stock  which we valued at million 
wilson bennett s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the purchase date 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
wilson bennett uses a value oriented approach that focuses on large capitalization stocks 
wilson bennett s primary source of revenue is management fees earned on the assets it manages for its customers 
these management fees are generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets and  accordingly  revenues from wilson bennett will be  assuming a consistent customer base  more when appropriate indices  such as the s p  are higher and lower when such indices are depressed 
on february   we acquired certain fiduciary and other assets and assumed certain liabilities of fbr national trust company  formerly a subsidiary of friedman  billings  ramsey group  inc our new trust division acts as trustee or custodian for assets in excess of billion as of february  services provided by this division include trust  estates  custody  investment management  escrows  and retirement plans 
this acquisition did not have a significant impact on operating results for the year ended december  the trust division is included  along with cws and wilson bennett  in the wealth management and trust services segment 
in prior periods  this segment was called investment services or trust and investment services 
in july  we announced the retirement of john w 
fisher  wilson bennett s founder  chief executive officer and president  from wilson bennett and as a member of our board of directors as of september  as mr 
fisher transitioned out of his involvement with wilson bennett  several significant clients unexpectedly either terminated or advised us that they intended to terminate their asset management contracts during the third quarter 
this triggered an evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
accordingly  we updated our analysis of the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of wilson bennett 
the updated analysis indicated an impairment to the goodwill and certain customer relationships and mr 
fisher s employment agreement 
we recorded a non cash impairment loss totaling million pretax  and million after tax  during the quarter ended september  since mr 
fisher s retirement announcement  wilson bennett has added experienced portfolio managers and professional sales staff to assist with cross sell opportunities with our other divisions 
we will continue to monitor the operations of wilson bennett  its customer base and managed and custodial assets and any associated impact on goodwill and the remaining intangible assets in the future 
on july   we acquired george mason in a cash transaction for million 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and million of amortizable intangible assets 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and george mason s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the purchase date and its operating results are included in our consolidated results since the date of the acquisition 
george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through seven branches located throughout the metropolitan washington  dc region 
george mason does business in eight states  primarily virginia and maryland  and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater washington metropolitan area  generating originations of approximately billion and billion of loans in and  respectively  excluding advances on construction loans and including loans purchased from other mortgage banking companies which are owned by local home builders but managed by george mason 
george mason s primary sources of revenue include net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gains on sales of loans and contractual management fees earned relating to services provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders 
loans are made pursuant to purchase commitments and are sold servicing released 
george mason also offers a construction to permanent loan program 
this program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences 
once the home has been completed  the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market 
these construction to permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for george mason and are classified as loans held for sale 
george mason s business is both cyclical and seasonal 
the cyclical nature of its business is influenced by  among other factors  the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates  national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy 
historically  george mason has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year 
in july  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and pay interest at a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at par beginning september under certain qualifying events  these securities are redeemable at a premium through march and at par thereafter 
the interest rate on this debt was at december  we have guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by us to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it entirely 
in addition to management of interest rate risk  we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  non interest income is an increasingly important source of revenue for us and includes  among other things  service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income and gains and losses on sales of investment securities available for sale  gains on sales of loans and management fee income 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income non interest income is a larger percentage of our total revenue in than primarily because we owned george mason for a full year in compared to approximately a half year in non interest income is a lower percentage of our total revenue in than because mortgage originations were lower due to the cyclical nature of the business 
our business strategy is to grow through regional expansion  while maintaining strong asset quality and achieving increased profitability 
we completed a secondary common stock offering that raised million in capital during the second quarter of this capital is being used to support our continuing expansion and balance sheet growth 
as a result of this increased capital and retained earnings  we increased our legal lending limit to million as of december   which allows us to expand our commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
financial developments the year ended december  was our fourth consecutive year of profitability 
for the year  we reported net income of million 
george mason contributed million to consolidated net income during wilson bennett was included in our operating results for the full year and  as a result of the previously mentioned impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of  recorded a net loss of million 
the trust division was included in our operating results since february   the date of its acquisition  and contributed  of pretax income 
total assets increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
total deposits increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  for the year ended december   we reported net income of million 
george mason was included in our operating results for the full year and contributed million to consolidated net income during wilson bennett was included in our operating results since june   the date of its acquisition  and contributed  of pretax income 
total assets increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
total deposits increased by million in  from million at december   to billion at december  for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per diluted common share 
george mason was included in our operating results since july  and contributed approximately million to consolidated net income during critical accounting policies general us generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions  judgments  and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results  in fact  could differ from initial estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for economic hedging activities  accounting for business combinations and impairment testing of goodwill  accounting for the impairment of intangible assets  and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of the individual borrowers 
unusual and infrequently occurring events  such as hurricanes and other weather related disasters  may impact our assessment of possible credit losses 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors  such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 
for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
in the absence of meaningful historical loss factors  peer group loss factors are applied and are adjusted by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent 
since we have limited historical data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to all loans classified as special mention  a loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are adequate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment 
additional provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
accounting for economic hedging activities we account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the statement of condition at their fair values 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
for derivatives designated as hedges  we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship  including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness 
we evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis 
ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  except for the ineffective portion 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including rate lock commitments  to finance residential mortgage loans 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts 
during the rate lock commitment period  these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
 as amended 
the fair values of loan commitments and the fair values of forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions  and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
at the closing of the loan  the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract 
loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
prior to october   the changes in value of the forward loan sales contracts from the date the loan closed to the date it was sold to an investor were marked to market through earnings 
on october   we began designating our forward sales contracts as hedges to mitigate the variability in cash flow to be received from the sale of mortgage loans 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively  when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in anticipated cash flows of the loans held for sale 
in situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable an anticipated loan sale will not occur  we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
accounting for business combinations and impairment testing of goodwill we account for acquisitions of other businesses in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
this statement mandates the use of purchase accounting and  accordingly  assets and liabilities  including previously unrecorded assets and liabilities  are recorded at fair values as of the acquisition date 
we utilize a variety of valuation methods to estimate fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
these methodologies are often based upon assumptions and estimates which may change at a future date and require that the carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired be adjusted 
to support our purchase allocations  we have utilized independent consultants to identify and value identifiable purchased intangibles 
the difference between the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and any other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested on at least an annual basis for impairment 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
accounting for the impairment of intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets  including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
new financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires that companies recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
we applied this standard beginning january  this statement requires that stock awards be classified as either an equity award or a liability award 
equity classified awards are valued as of the grant date using either an observable market price or a valuation methodology 
liability classified awards are valued at fair value as of each reporting date 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method which requires  among other things  that we recognize compensation cost for all awards outstanding at january  for which the requisite service had not been rendered 
all of our unvested stock options are classified as equity awards 
on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement principles for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 

sab no 
discusses the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements to determine if any restatement of prior financial statements is required 
the statement addresses the two techniques commonly used in practice in accumulating and quantifying misstatements  and requires that the technique with the most severe result be used in determining whether a misstatement is material 
sab no 
was effective for fiscal years ending after november  we adopted this standard during see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for information related to the adoption of this standard and the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations at and for the year ended december  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability at the measurement date 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement 
it also establishes a fair value hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
amends sfas nos 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status 
secondly  it requires employers to measure the plan assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the fiscal year 
lastly  employers are required to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year that the changes occur with the changes reported in comprehensive income 
the standard was effective for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas sfas no 
allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between entities that elect different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted subject to specific requirements outlined in the new standard 
we will evaluate this standard to determine the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

statements of operations net interest income margin net interest income is our primary source of revenue  representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
the level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates 
at the end of  the federal funds rate was at  its lowest level in over forty years 
during  as economic activity increased  the federal reserve raised the key federal funds rate five times to by year end 
the federal reserve continued this policy in  increasing the federal funds rate eight times to by year end  and in increased the federal funds rate four times to by year end 
see interest rate sensitivity for further information

the increase in net interest income was primarily a result of increases in the interest rates and average volume of loans receivable and investment securities  net of the impact of increased funding costs during  compared with the increase in funding costs was primarily attributable to an increase in rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities 
net increases in loans receivable and investment securities were funded through the increase in total deposits and a decrease in loans held for sale 
our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december  and was and  respectively  primarily as a result of a basis point increase in the rates earned on average interest earning assets offset by an increased cost of average interest bearing liabilities of basis points

at december   our brokered certificates of deposit decreased million to million 
as maturities in our brokered certificates of deposit portfolio occurred  we were able to replace that funding with increases in our core deposit products 
our utilization of the brokered certificates of deposit market averaged million in  a decrease of million from an average of million in the following is a summary of our average earning and non earning assets and interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities for the three years ended december  and the resulting yields and cost of funding for those years

interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk 
our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 
we employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity 
we use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as now  money market  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were liability sensitive for the entire two year simulation period 
liability sensitive means that we have more liabilities repricing than assets 
we have more of our liabilities in non maturity or short term deposit products than we have in floating rate assets 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  net interest income would grow for a liability sensitive bank 
in the down basis point scenario  net interest income improves by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
in the up basis point scenario  the bank shows asset sensitivity for the first year with net interest income improving by not more than but by the second year net interest income falls compared to the base case so that over the two year period  net interest income improves by 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is primarily reflective of a shift in the loan mix in our portfolio with a greater percentage of the overall loan portfolio comprised of lower risk residential real estate loans  an improvement in overall credit quality and our evaluation of our loan portfolio and the qualitative factors we use to determine the adequacy of our loan loss reserve 
we continued to experience strong loan quality with annualized net charged off loans equal to less than to average loans receivable for the year ended december   and non performing loans equal to of total loans as of december  the provision for loan losses was million for the growth in loans during was comprised primarily of increases in our residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios and our home equity loan portfolio  which require lower allowances than the remainder of the loan portfolio

non interest income non interest income includes service charges on deposits and loans  gains on sales of loans held for sale  investment fee income  management fee income  and gains on sales of investment securities available for sale  and continues to be an important factor in our operating results 
non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of decreased gains on sales of loans held for sale of million 
the decrease in gains on sales of loans held for sale is due to the slowdown in the regional housing market 
included in the net gains on sales of loans held for sale are any origination  underwriting  and discount points and other funding fees received and deferred at loan origination 
costs include direct costs associated with the loan origination  such as commissions and salaries that are deferred at the time of origination 
also contributing to the decrease in non interest income  management fee income decreased by  in compared to management fees represent the income earned for services george mason provides to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders and generally fluctuates based on the volume of loan sales 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  deposit service charges increased primarily as a result of an increased number of transaction accounts in compared to loan service charges decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in loan service charges decreased due to decreases in loan originations at george mason during  compared to originations during because of the aforementioned slowdown in the regional housing market 
investment fee income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in investment fee income is primarily attributable to the addition of the trust division in february and a full year of operations of wilson bennett in included in other income are gains related to the extinguishment of two borrowings totaling  for the year ended december  compared to a gain of  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we received a litigation settlement from a previously charged off investment of  in addition  we invested million in bank owned life insurance during the third quarter of the increase in the cash surrender value of the insurance policy for the year ended december  was  and is included in other income

the increase in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of increased gains on sales of loans held for sale of million 
this increase is a result of including the operations of george mason in our operating results for the full year of compared to slightly less than six months in also contributing to the increase in non interest income  and also as a direct result of the george mason acquisition  management fee income rose by million in compared to service charges on deposit accounts increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  deposit service charges increased primarily as a result of an increased number of transaction accounts in compared to loan service charges increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to  in loan service charges increased due to increased loan volume at the bank and including the operations of george mason for the full year of investment fee income increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  investment fee income increased due to increases in assets under management at cws and the addition of  in fee income from wilson bennett since its acquisition in june the following table provides additional detail on non interest income for the years ended december    and table non interest income years ended december    and in thousands insufficient funds fee income service charges on deposit accounts other fee income on deposit accounts atm transaction fees loan service charges investment fee income trust adminstration fee income bank owned life insurance income net gain on sales of loans management fee income net realized gain on investment securities available for sale net gain loss on sales of assets credit card fees litigation recovery on previously impaired investment gain on debt extinguishments other income total non interest income non interest expense non interest expense includes  among other things  salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  professional fees  depreciation  data processing  telecommunications and miscellaneous expenses 
non interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in non interest expense for the year ended december   compared to  was primarily the result of the branch expansion that has occurred over the past two years and our acquisition of the trust division in february in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to wilson bennett see overview and financial overview above for more information 
expenses related to the branch expansion are represented in the increases in our salaries and benefits expense  occupancy expense and depreciation 
advertising and marketing and telecommunications have also increased to support our branch openings and strong asset growth over the past year

investment securities our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity 
the investment portfolio consists of investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity 
investment securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily until maturity 
these securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset liability strategy  liquidity management or regulatory capital management 
investment securities held to maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities were million at december   an increase of million or  from million in investment securities at december  of the million in the investment portfolio at december   million were classified as held to maturity  and million were classified as available for sale 
at december   the yield on the available for sale investment portfolio was and the yield on the held to maturity portfolio was 
during  we began purchasing bank qualified tax exempt municipal investment securities 
at december   tax exempt municipal securities were million 
at december  and  investment securities with unrealized losses are investment grade securities 
investment securities with unrealized losses have interest rates that are less than current market interest rates and  therefore  the indicated temporary losses are not a result of permanent credit impairment 
mortgage backed investment securities  which are the primary component of the unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio at those dates  are primarily comprised of securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and government national mortgage association gnma

business segment operations we provide banking and non banking financial services and products through our subsidiaries 
we operate in three business segments  commercial banking  mortgage banking and wealth management and trust services 
the commercial banking segment includes both commercial and consumer lending and provides customers such products as commercial loans  real estate loans  and other business financing and consumer loans 
in addition  this segment also provides customers with various deposit products including demand deposit accounts  savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
the mortgage banking segment engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis 
the wealth management and trust services segment provides investment and financial services to businesses and individuals  including financial planning  retirement estate planning  trusts  estates  custody  investment management  escrows  and retirement plans

capital resources capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance 
our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution 
the guidelines define capital as both tier which includes common shareholders equity  defined to include certain debt obligations and tier to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and of unrealized gains in equity securities

we must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items into cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
we believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
we maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet 
in this forecast  we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion 
we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
in addition  one stress test combines all other stress tests to see how liquidity would react to several negative scenarios occurring at the same time 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
george mason and the bank have a million floating rate revolving credit and security agreement with a third party 
the purpose of this credit facility is to fund residential mortgage loans made by george mason prior to their sale into the secondary market 
the credit facility requires  among other things  that george mason and the bank have positive quarterly net income and maintain specified minimum tangible and regulatory net worth levels 
the company has guaranteed repayment of this debt 
the interest rate on this credit facility is libor plus between and 
at december   none of this line was utilized 
in addition to this facility  this same lender also has provided a million facility that is utilized by george mason to warehouse residential mortgage loans held for sale to this lender 
the terms of this facility are substantially the same as the above referenced revolving credit and security agreement and the cost of this facility is netted against interest earned on the loans pending settlement with the lender 
loans under this credit facility are considered sold when financed 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale  totaled million at december   or of total assets 
we held investments that are classified as held to maturity in the amount of million at december  to maintain ready access to the bank s secured lines of credit  the bank has pledged the majority of its securities to the federal home loan bank of atlanta with additional securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of richmond 
additional borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at december  was approximately million 
borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of richmond was approximately million at december  george mason has million of lines of credit available from outside sources 
we anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us 
the required payments under such obligations were as follows table contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta trust preferred securities operating lease obligations total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
we have derivative counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

interest rate risk arises because the assets of the bank and the liabilities of the bank have different maturities and characteristics 
in order to measure this interest rate risk  we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
this model is run for the bank by an independent consulting firm that was hired by the bank in the fourth quarter of the simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as now  money market  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged 
this becomes the base case 
next  the model determines the impact on net interest income given specified changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually increased by basis points in the first year and remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were liability sensitive for the entire two year simulation period 
liability sensitive means that we have more liabilities repricing than assets 
we have more of our liabilities in non maturity or short term deposit products than we have in floating rate assets 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  net interest income would grow for a liability sensitive bank 
in the down basis point scenario  net interest income improves by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
in the up basis point scenario  the bank shows asset sensitivity for the first year with net interest income improving by not more than but by the second year net interest income falls compared to the base case so that over the two year period  net interest income improves by
