earnings overview vs 
net income in was  or per share basic and per share diluted 
net income for was down from per share basic and per share diluted in in  the trends of the past few years that have negatively impacted the corporation s earnings results continued  as the yield curve moved from flat to inverted  and noninterest expense continued to increase 
the net interest margin decreased  or  in as compared to the flat or inverted yield curve  along with competitive pressures  caused interest rates paid on liabilities mainly deposits and borrowings to increase more than the rates of interest earned on loans and investment securities 
further  the flat or inverted yield curve resulted in limited opportunities to earn a positive spread from maintaining borrowed funds and holding investment securities 
accordingly  the corporation sold securities and repaid borrowings throughout much of the balance of available for sale securities was  lower at december  than one year earlier  and the december  balance of short term and long term borrowings was  lower than one year earlier 
noninterest expense increased  in over much of the increase in noninterest expense in has been attributable to operations and start up costs in new markets  including the first state bank offices canisteo and south hornell in new york state  and the jersey shore and old lycoming township offices in pennsylvania 
gains related to sales of credit card loans totaled  in and  in in the fourth quarter  the corporation sold the c n bank credit card receivables  and recorded a gain of  after the sale  the corporation continued to provide servicing of credit cards for a portion of  and was subject to possible losses associated with credit card receivables sold with recourse 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation recorded an additional gain of  for the difference between the initial estimates of post sale servicing expenses and recourse losses  and the actual amounts incurred 
also in  the corporation sold first state bank s credit card portfolio for a gain of  net realized gains from sales of securities amounted to  in  an increase of  over most of the gains realized in have been from sales of bank stocks 
also  in the fourth quarter  c n had net losses from sales of securities of  the fourth quarter losses were mainly from sales of debt securities that were purchased in and  when market yields were lower than in the provision for loan losses was  in  down from  in in  negotiations and workout of a few large  commercial loans were completed  resulting in charge offs that were significantly less than the estimated allowances that had been previously established 
vs 
net income in totaled  or per share basic  and per share diluted 
net income per share for was down from per share basic and per share diluted in as in  the corporation s lower earnings than had been realized in resulted mainly from the flattening yield curve and a significant increase in noninterest expense  along with other factors 
despite substantial loan growth in  the net interest margin increased only slightly in over as noted in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis  when calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income was lower by  in than in 
similar to  management decided to shrink the investment portfolio and repay borrowings in accordingly  the december  balance of available for sale securities was  lower than the year end balance  and the december  balance of short term and long term borrowings was  lower than year end noninterest expense increased  in over total salaries and benefit expenses increased  or in over  primarily due to new hires to accommodate expansion into new branches and for several support functions 
furniture and equipment expense increased  or  mainly due to depreciation and maintenance costs associated with the new core banking software system  which was implemented in the fourth quarter the provision for loan losses increased  in over  mainly due to estimates of possible future charge offs on several large commercial loans  as well as volume related increases in the portions of the provision determined based on historical net charge off and subjective factors 
as referenced above  in the fourth quarter the corporation realized a gain from the sale of credit card receivables of  also in the fourth quarter  the corporation had net losses from sales of securities of  contributing to a  reduction in net securities gains in as compared to outlook for in looking ahead to  it is important to consider the corporation s prospects in light of the environment and activity of the past few years 
the historically long over years flat and inverted yield curve has challenged the corporation s ability to achieve earnings growth 
despite this challenging environment  the corporation has continued to implement its strategic plan by opening four new c n bank branches and acquiring the two new york state first state bank branches  during this time frame 
further  the corporation has experienced significant increases in its operating costs as a result of acquiring and implementing a new core banking software system late in  added personnel to keep up with increases in regulatory burden and built a new administrative building to house the higher numbers of employees 
all of these issues the yield curve  branches with less than mature market share and operating expense pressures are expected to continue in  and management expects that it will be difficult to generate earnings at a level much greater in than was realized in while management acknowledges the challenges cited above  there are many reasons for long term optimism going into the lycoming county offices have contributed significantly to loan and deposit growth over the past few years  and management anticipates continued growth in that market 
in the fourth quarter  two new lenders were hired with the expectation for increased commercial and consumer business in the new york state market 
the trust and financial management group has grown assets under management to  at december   an increase of since the end of  and increased revenue by in over management is focused on this area of noninterest revenue in an effort to reduce reliance on the net interest margin  and believes the prospects for continued growth in this area are encouraging 
in december  the corporation signed a definitive merger agreement with citizens bancorp  inc citizens of coudersport 
citizens is the parent company of citizens trust company ctc  a commercial bank with offices in the pennsylvania communities of coudersport  emporium and port allegany 
as of december   citizens reported total assets of million 
the agreement provides for citizens to merge into the corporation  and ctc to merge into c n bank 
in the aggregate  of the shares of citizens common stock will be purchased for cash and of the shares of citizens common stock will be exchanged for shares of corporation common stock 
the estimated total purchase consideration is valued at approximately million 
management expects the transaction to be completed during the second quarter consummation of the merger is subject to approval by citizens shareholders  regulatory approvals and other customary conditions of closing 
management believes the prospects for both organizations  and the addition of citizens management group to the corporation s team will result in increased opportunities for the combined organization 
in  management anticipates start up and duplicate operating costs will result in the transaction being slightly dilutive to earnings per share  however  in  management expects the impact of the transaction on earnings to be accretive 
another major variable that affects the corporation s earnings is securities gains and losses 
management s decisions regarding sales of securities are based on a variety of factors  with the overall goal of maximizing portfolio return over a long term horizon 
it is difficult to predict  with any reasonable degree of certainty  the amount of net securities gains and losses that will be realized in total capital purchases for are estimated at million  with renovations of existing facilities and computer equipment and software the largest planned categories of expenditure 
this would be the corporation s lowest total capital purchases amount since with the exception of the citizens acquisition  as management has no current plans to build or acquire new branches in critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing these fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
accordingly  when selling debt securities  management typically obtains price quotes from more than one source 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the large majority of the corporation s securities are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported separately through accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity 
net interest margin the corporation s primary source of operating income is represented by the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest margin in  and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest margin amounts presented in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income fell  to  in from  in as reflected in table iii  interest rate changes had the effect of decreasing net interest income  in as compared to  as rising short term interest rates caused increases in interest expense 
table iii also shows that volume changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  in over the major components of the increase in net interest income from volume changes in were an increase of  attributable to loan growth and a decrease in interest expense of  related to lower long term borrowings  partially offset by  lower interest income from a lower volume of available for sale securities 
as presented in table ii  the interest rate spread excess of average rate of return on interest bearing assets over average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities shrunk to in from in in  the net interest margin was  down  or  from similar to s results  table iii shows that interest rate changes caused a decrease in net interest income of  in compared to  while volume changes mainly attributable to loan growth increased net interest income  as shown in table ii  the interest rate spread of in was down from in interest income and earning assets interest income totaled  in  or higher than in interest and fees from loans increased  or  while income from available for sale securities decreased  or 
the majority of the increase in interest income resulted from higher loan volume  along with an increase in the average rate earned on loans  which more than offset the effect of the lower average volume of available for sale securities 
total average gross loans increased in over  to  from  while loan growth was not at the or more levels experienced for each of the immediately prior several years  loan demand has remained good for both commercial and mortgage loans throughout the corporation s market area 
in addition  the acquisition of first state bank  which was added to the corporation s balance sheet for the final months of  contributed to the increase in average loans in compared to excluding first state bank  average total deposits increased in compared to the average rate of return on loans was in  up from in as indicated in table ii  total average available for sale securities in fell to  a decrease of  or from proceeds from sales and maturities of securities have been used  in part  to help fund loans and pay off borrowings 
within the available for sale securities portfolio  the average balance of municipal bonds shrunk to  in from  in management decided to reduce the corporation s investment in municipal bonds in order to reduce the alternative minimum tax liability 
also  because short term interest rates have been rising faster than long term rates  there have been only limited opportunities to purchase mortgage backed securities or other taxable bonds at spreads sufficient to justify the applicable interest rate risk 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for  up from in similar to  in the average balance of loans grew while available for sale securities fell 
as reflected in table ii  total average gross loans increased in over  to  from  the acquisition of loans from first state bank contributed of the growth in average loans 
the average yield on loans was in  up slightly from the average yield for of 
the total average balance of available for sale securities decreased in as compared to  for the same reasons as the portfolio continued to shrink in as discussed above 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities of for in was slightly lower than the generated in interest expense and interest bearing liabilities interest expense rose  or  to  in from  in table ii shows that the overall cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities rose to in  from in from table ii  you can calculate that total average deposits interest bearing and noninterest bearing increased to  in from  in the most significant increases in average deposits by categories were  for interest checking accounts   for certificates of deposit  and  for demand deposit accounts 
average money market account balances decreased  or  in as compared to  as some depositors have moved balances to higher rate certificates of deposit or withdrawn funds to invest in equities 
most of the increase in interest checking balances is attributable to one local governmental customer  for which the corporation became the primary depository institution in september in addition  the acquisition of first state bank contributed significantly to the increase in average deposits in compared to excluding first state bank  average total deposits increased in compared to the combined average total short term and long term borrowed funds decreased  to  in from  in as discussed earlier in management s discussion and analysis  because the yield curve has been flat or inverted  the corporation s opportunities have been limited for earning a positive spread by purchasing or holding investment securities as compared to interest costs associated with maintaining borrowed funds 
accordingly  the corporation has been paying off borrowings as they mature  or rolling them over at terms of less than one year 
the pace of such changes or trends is reflected in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet  as total short term borrowings increased to  at december  from  at december   while total long term borrowings decreased to  at december  from  at december  in  interest expense rose  or over the overall cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities rose to in  from in in table ii  you can see that rising short term interest rates caused increases in the average rates incurred on money market accounts  certificates of deposit  interest checking accounts and short term borrowings 
helping to offset some of the impact of rising short term market rates were passbook individual retirement accounts iras  for which the average rate fell to from  and long term borrowings  for which the average rate fell to from 
in the first quarter  the average rate paid on the majority of the corporation s iras was  which was the floor on month variable iras that existed prior to october  effective april   the floor on those iras fell to  and the corporation s variable ira rate ranged from to over the remainder of and the decrease in average rate incurred on long term borrowings resulted from repayment of borrowings originated in earlier interest rate cycles at higher rates 
as you can calculate from table ii  total average deposits interest bearing and noninterest bearing increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
fluctuations in deposits of nonprofit and municipal customers impacted average deposit balances significantly in  as the corporation both lost and gained customers with average balances exceeding million 
the acquisition of deposits from first state bank contributed  or  of the increase in average deposits

noninterest income vs 
total noninterest income increased  or  in compared to the largest change within this category is related to securities gains  which increased  and which are discussed in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis 
the gains related to sale of credit card loans  which decreased  in as compared to  is also discussed in the earnings overview section 
other items of significance are as follows service charges on deposit accounts increased  or  in over c n bank overdraft charges increased  in over  primarily from the effects of a rate increase in august and an increased volume of overdrafts on business checking accounts 
also  service charges from first state bank increased  in  as a result of including first state bank in the corporation s consolidated financial statements for the full year in as opposed to only the last four months of 
trust and financial management revenue increased  or  in over total assets under management amounted to  as of december   an increase of over the amount one year earlier 
appreciation in the equities markets  along with an increase in volume of business  contributed to the increase in assets under management and revenue 
fees related to credit card operation decreased  due to the sale of c n bank s credit card operations in the fourth quarter other operating income increased  or  in over included in this category were an increase of  in dividend income on federal home loan bank of pittsburgh stock  due to a higher rate of dividends paid  and an increase of  in debit card fees 
vs 
total noninterest income increased  or  in as compared to the gain from sale of credit card loans  and reduced amount of net realized security gains in as compared to are discussed in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis 
other items of significance are as follows service charges on deposit accounts fell slightly  to  in from  in throughout much of the first half of  changes in deposit account processing resulting from the new core banking system resulted in overdraft and other charges not being assessed for some transactions that would have generated charges with the former system 
management worked with the core system vendor  and during the third quarter was able to reestablish virtually all of the remaining  significant overdraft and service charge routines 
those changes  along with fee increases in overdraft and other services  helped restore service charge revenue for  on an annual basis  to a level almost as high as in trust and financial management revenue decreased  to  in from  in the small decrease in revenue for occurred mainly because revenue for included more fees collected from settlements of estates 
much of the trust fees are determined based on the amount of assets under management  which increased as of december  as compared to one year earlier  to  fees related to the corporation s credit card operation increased  or  in over  primarily because of higher volumes and rates on merchant processing and interchange transactions 
this source of revenue did not recur after  due to the sale of the credit card portfolio 
other operating income increased  or  in over within this line item  the largest changes in were increases in the following categories dividends from federal home loan bank of pittsburgh stock  which increased  to  debit card fees  which increased  to  broker dealer revenues  which increased  to  and training grant revenue of  with none received in table iv comparison of noninterest income in thousands change change service charges on deposit accounts service charges and fees trust and financial management revenue insurance commissions  fees and premiums increase in cash surrender value of life insurance fees related to credit card operation other operating income total other income before gain on sale of credit card loans and realized gains on securities  net gain on sale of credit card loans realized gains on securities  net total other income noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased  or  in over  and  or  in over increased levels of expenses in and resulted mainly from expansion  as the corporation opened or acquired new offices in jersey shore  pa august  canisteo and south hornell  ny august and old lycoming township  pa march 
also  the corporation built a new administrative office in wellsboro  pa  which opened in march vs 
salaries and wages increased  or  in over the increase in salaries expense relates primarily to the increase in the number of full time equivalent employees  which has averaged higher since august of for  new branch operations at jersey shore  old lycoming township and new york state added  to salaries expense 
pension and other employee benefits increased  or  in over the increase in number of people and covered compensation is the primary reason for the increase 
in the aggregate  total pensions and other employee benefits expense  as a percentage of salaries and wages  was in  up from in and note to the consolidated financial statements provides information concerning some of the larger expenses within this category  including the defined benefit pension and postretirement health plans  the k esop and the supplemental executive retirement plan 
occupancy expense increased  or  in compared to the increase in total occupancy costs in includes  for the jersey shore  old lycoming and new york state locations  and  for the new administration building in wellsboro 
other noninterest expense increased  or in compared to the increase in other expenses includes an increase of  for the new york state locations in  including  for the amortization of the core deposit intangible 
in addition  in the second quarter  other expense included a one time charge of  for impairment of leasehold improvements from early termination of a property lease 
included in the total is  for non payroll related expenses associated with the credit card operation  which was sold in the fourth quarter vs 
salaries and wages increased  or  in over the increase in salaries expense in was primarily a reflection of a greater number of employees  resulting from expansion into new branches and the addition of new employees for support functions 
pensions and other employee benefit expenses increased  or  in over increases in numbers of employees drove up expenses for health insurance  contributions to the savings and retirement k plan and payroll taxes 
helping to mitigate some of the expense increases within this category were reductions in expense associated with the defined benefit plan and professional fees related to employee benefit plan matters 
occupancy expense increased  or  in over  primarily as a result of higher depreciation and maintenance costs associated with new facilities 
furniture and equipment expense increased  or  in over depreciation expense within this category increased  to  in from  in  including an increase of  in from the new core banking software system that was placed in service during the fourth quarter similarly  maintenance and repair expense within this category increased  in over  primarily because of inclusion of a full year of maintenance costs associated with the new core banking software system of approximately  in  up from months of costs totaling  in other operating expense increased  or  in over most of the line items within this category increased in  in part due to expansion into more locations and the resulting higher volume of transactions and costs

the most significant increases within this category were expenses associated with maintaining and preparing other real estate properties for sale  which increased  in to  attorney fees  which increased  in to  mainly because of collection activities on a large commercial credit  and bucktail expenses  which increased  to  due to a larger volume of claims 
helping to reduce the overall increase in this category was a decrease in professional fees of  to  in in  the corporation incurred a significant amount of professional fees expense associated with the core banking system conversion

management decided to reduce the corporation s investment in municipal bonds in order to reduce the alternative minimum tax liability in and a more complete analysis of income taxes is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition significant changes in the average balances of the corporation s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are described in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis 
that discussion provides useful information regarding changes in the corporation s balance sheet over the year period ended december   including discussions of available for sale securities  loans  deposits and borrowings 
the acquisition of canisteo valley corporation was effective at the end of august that transaction was an all cash acquisition  which had the effect of increasing the corporation s assets and liabilities 
at december   total consolidated assets of canisteo valley corporation amounted to  including net loans of  while deposits totaled  other significant balance sheet items the allowance for loan losses and stockholders equity are discussed in separate sections of management s discussion and analysis 
table vi shows the composition of the investment portfolio at december   and comparison of the amortized cost totals of available for sale securities at each year end presented reflects a reduction from  at december  to  at december   and then a further reduction to  at december  management s decision to reduce the size of the securities portfolio has been attributable to primary factors substantial loan growth  and the need to manage interest rate risk within acceptable parameters 
specifically  in light of the flat yield curve  the opportunities have been very limited for earning a positive spread from maintaining borrowed funds and holding investment securities  and because there is almost no difference between short term and long term rates  the corporation faces the risk that excessive holdings of long term  fixed rate securities could result in future losses or diminished net interest margin results when the yield curve normalizes 
accordingly  management has utilized proceeds from principal repayments and sales of securities to help fund loan growth 
the corporation s liquidity position is discussed in a separate section of management s discussion and analysis  and interest rate risk is discussed in more detail in part ii  item a 
the balance of loans outstanding has grown substantially over the past years 
as reflected in table vii  the year end balance of loans  net of the allowance for loan losses  increased as of december  compared to the previous year end  and grew by more than in each of the years before table viii presents a table of loan maturities 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that the majority  or of the loan portfolio is fixed rate  including  or fixed rate beyond years 
this substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans is one of the major concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices 
see part ii  item a for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s interest rate risk 
total capital purchases for are estimated at approximately million 
in light of the corporation s strong capital position and ample sources of liquidity  management does not expect capital expenditures to have a material  detrimental effect on the corporation s financial condition in the overall impact on the corporation s earnings in and thereafter will depend on the corporation s ability to build market share and produce profitable results from those locations  and how long that will take

the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
in evaluating collectibility  management considers a number of factors  including the status of specific impaired loans  trends in historical loss experience  delinquency trends  credit concentrations  comparison of historical loan loss data to that of other financial institutions and economic conditions within the corporation s market area 
allowances for impaired loans are determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense  and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
the discussion that follows explains management s current processes for estimating the allowance for loan losses  and provides information concerning the provision for loan losses in and the valuation of the allowance at december  and in recent prior years 
there are two major components of the allowance statement of financial accounting standards sfas allowances on larger loans  mainly commercial purpose  determined on a loan by loan basis  and sfas allowances estimates of losses incurred on the remainder of the portfolio  determined based on collective evaluation of impairment for various categories of loans 
sfas allowances include a portion based on historical net charge off experience  and a portion based on evaluation of qualitative factors 
each quarter  management performs a detailed assessment of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
a management committee called the watch list committee performs this assessment 
quarterly  the watch list committee and the applicable lenders discuss each loan relationship under review  and reach a consensus on the appropriate sfas estimated loss amount for the quarter 
the watch list committee s focus is on ensuring that all pertinent facts have been considered  and that the sfas loss amounts are reasonable 
the assessment process includes review of certain loans reported on the watch list 
all loans  which lenders or the credit administration staff has assigned a risk rating of special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss  are included in the watch list 
the scope of loans evaluated individually for impairment sfas evaluation include all loan relationships greater than  for c n bank loans  and  for first state bank  for which there is at least one extension of credit graded substandard  doubtful or loss 
also  loan relationships less than  in the aggregate  but with an estimated loss of  or more  are individually evaluated for impairment 
the banks also engage consulting firms  at least annually  to perform independent credit reviews of large credit relationships 
management gives substantial consideration to the classifications and recommendations of the independent credit reviewers in determining the allowance for loan losses 
the sfas component of the allowance includes estimates of losses incurred on loans that have not been individually evaluated for impairment 
management uses loan categories included in the call report a quarterly report filed by fdic insured banks to identify categories of loans with similar risk characteristics  and multiplies the loan balances for each category as of each quarter end by two different factors to determine the sfas allowance amounts 
these two factors are based on historical net charge off experience  and qualitative factors 
the sum of the allowance amounts calculated for each risk category  including both the amount based on historical net charge off experience and the amount based on evaluation of qualitative factors  is equal to the total sfas component of the allowance 
the historical net charge off portion of the sfas allowance component is calculated by the accounting department as of the end of the applicable quarter 
for each loan classification category used in the call report  the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the ratio of net charge offs to average quarterly loan balances for the previous three calendar years 
prior to the fourth quarter  c n bank had utilized the ratio of net charge offs to average balances over a five year period in calculating the historical loan loss experience portion of the allowance portfolio 
management made the change to the three year assumption  which had very little effect on the allowance valuation as of december   mainly because management believes net charge off experience over a year period may be more representative of losses existing in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
effective in the second quarter  management began to calculate the effects of specific qualitative factors criteria to determine a percentage increase or decrease in the sfas allowance  in relation to the historical net charge off percentage 
the qualitative factors analysis involves assessment of changes in factors affecting the portfolio  to provide for estimated differences between losses currently inherent in the portfolio and the amounts determined based on recent historical loss rates and from identification of losses on specific individual loans 
a management committee called the qualitative factors committee meets quarterly  near the end of the final month of each quarter 
the qualitative factors committee discusses several qualitative factors  including economic conditions  lending policies  changes in the portfolio  risk profile of the portfolio  competition and regulatory requirements  and other factors  with consideration given to how the factors affect three distinct parts of the loan portfolio commercial  mortgage and consumer 
during or soon after completion of the meeting  each member of the committee prepares an update to his or her recommended percentage adjustment for each qualitative factor  and average qualitative factor adjustments are calculated for commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the applicable qualitative factor percentages  to determine the portion of the sfas allowance attributable to qualitative factors 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table table x includes the sfas component of the allowance on the line item called impaired loans 
as of december  and  sfas estimated losses  including both the portion determined based on historical net charge off results  as well as the portion based on management s assessment of qualitative factors  are allocated in table x to the applicable categories of commercial  consumer mortgage and consumer loans 
in periods prior to  the portion of the allowance determined by management s subjective assessment of economic conditions and other factors which is now calculated using the qualitative factors criteria described above was reflected completely in the unallocated component of the allowance 
primarily as a result of this change in process  table x shows a reduction in the unallocated portion of the allowance to  at december  and at december  from  at december  the allowance for loan losses was  at december   down slightly from the december  balance of  as shown in table ix  net charge offs in totaled  as compared to  in and  in table ix also shows the provision for loan losses totaled  in  down from  in and  in in the second quarter  settlements were reached related to two large commercial loan relationships that had previously been classified as impaired 
total second quarter charge offs related to these two relationships were  or approximately  less than the estimated valuation allowance amounts that had been previously recorded 
these lower than anticipated charge off levels contributed to a reduction in the provision for loan losses in relatedly  the comparatively high provision for loan losses in resulted primarily from increases in sfas estimated losses that were recorded related to these loans 
the total amount of the provision for loan losses in each year is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above 
table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans 
as of december   total impaired loans amounted to  down slightly from  at december  and  at december   but much higher than the levels of impaired loans in and nonaccrual loans totaled  at december   up from  at december  and  at december  over the period  there have been a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
in the third quarter  management identified three commercial loan relationships with outstanding balances totaling approximately  that were moved to nonaccrual status and classified as impaired and which continue to be classified as nonaccrual and impaired as of december  
as of december   the sfas valuation allowance related to one of these relationships is  the third quarter increases in impaired and nonaccrual loans followed reductions in the second quarter  mainly because of the settlements of the two large commercial loan relationships referred to above 
management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss and nonaccrual status 
however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

liquidity liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost 
an adequate liquidity position permits the corporation to pay creditors  compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand 
the corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day to day liquidity 
also  the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with fhlb pittsburgh  secured by various securities and mortgage loans 
at december   the corporation had unused borrowing availability with correspondent banks and fhlb pittsburgh totaling approximately  additionally  the corporation uses repurchase agreements placed with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets  and uses reposweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis 
if required to raise cash in an emergency situation  the corporation could sell non pledged investment securities to meet its obligations 
at december   the carrying value of non pledged securities was  management believes the combination of its strong capital position discussed in the next section and ample available borrowing facilities have placed the corporation in a position of minimal short term and long term liquidity risk 
stockholders equity and capital adequacy the corporation and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies

as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements

comprehensive income comprehensive income is a measure of the change in equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income has included unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
comprehensive income should not be construed to be a measure of net income 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements

as discussed in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis  short term interest rates have risen significantly over the course of through  primarily because the federal reserve has increased the fed funds target rate times  from a low of to its current level of 
over this same period of time  long term interest rates have not increased nearly as much as short term rates  which has hurt the corporation s profitability by squeezing the net interest margin 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks

the corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
c n bank uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
only assets and liabilities of c n bank are included in management s monthly simulation model calculations 
since c n bank makes up more than of the corporation s total assets and liabilities  and because c n bank is the source of the most volatile interest rate risk  presently management does not consider it necessary to run the model for the remaining entities within the consolidated group 
management intends to add first state bank s data to the model  beginning sometime in for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
c n bank s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
c n bank s policy provides limits at  and basis points from current rates for fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario 
the policy also limits acceptable market value variances from the baseline values based on current rates 
as the table shows  as of december  and  the decline in net interest income and market value exceed the policy threshold marks if interest rates were to immediately rise or basis points 
these out of policy positions are a reflection of the corporation s liability sensitive position on average  deposits and borrowings reprice more quickly than loans and debt securities 
management has reviewed these positions with the board of directors quarterly throughout and  and management will continue to evaluate whether to make changes to asset and liability holdings in an effort to reduce exposure to rising interest rates 
the table that follows was prepared using the simulation model described above 
the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest margin and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

the corporation also owns some other stocks and mutual funds 
investments in bank stocks are subject to the risk factors affecting the banking industry generally  including competition from non bank entities  credit risk  interest rate risk and other factors that could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
further  because of the concentration of its holdings in pennsylvania banks  these investments could decline in value if there were a downturn in the state s economy 
the corporation s management monitors its risk associated with its equity securities holdings by reviewing its holdings on a detailed  individual security basis  at least monthly  considering all of the factors described above
