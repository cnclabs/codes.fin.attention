effective october   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r fas

under fas  gains and losses  prior service costs and credits  and any remaining transition amounts under fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and fas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax effects 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of the company s domestic pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  the discount rate for these plans  which comprised percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october   was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation increased from percent at october   to percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in fiscal  decreasing gradually to percent in fiscal the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects point increase point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on postretirement obligation as of october  employees hired after january   are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 
the company expects that pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal will be approximately  lower than fiscal  primarily reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions

we will continue to look for strategic acquisition opportunities  develop new applications and markets for our technologies  and implement lean and other operational initiatives as ways to further enhance financial performance 

table of contents effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices  sales volume  product mix and cost structures in each country where nordson operates

in fiscal compared with fiscal  the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies 
if fiscal exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal  sales would have been approximately  lower and third party costs would have been approximately  lower 
in fiscal compared with fiscal  the us dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies
