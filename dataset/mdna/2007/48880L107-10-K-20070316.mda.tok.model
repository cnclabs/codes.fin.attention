interest on the term loan is variable based on a libor rate plus an applicable margin

within days of the closing of the credit agreement by march   the company must enter into a hedge agreement to fix the interest rate on at least of the outstanding amount of the term loan for a minimum of three years

critical accounting polices and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated financial statements for a particular period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s net service revenues are based on fixed price contracts calculated on a percentage of completion basis based upon assumptions regarding the estimated total costs for each contract 
costs are incurred for each project and compared to the estimated budgeted costs for each contract to determine a percentage of completion on the project 
the percentage of completion is multiplied by the total contract value to determine the amount of revenue recognized 
management regularly reviews the budget on each contract to determine if the budgeted amounts are correct  and budgets are adjusted as needed 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be changed due to changes in the scope of the work 
when estimates indicate a loss  such loss is provided in the current period in its entirety 
the company attempts to negotiate contract amendments with the sponsor to cover services provided outside the terms of the original contract 
however  there can be no guarantee that the sponsor will agree to proposed amendments  and the company ultimately bears the risk of cost overruns 
the company also recognizes revenue under units based contracts  recognizing revenue as units are completed multiplied by the contract per unit price 
amendments to contracts resulting in revisions to revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the revisions are negotiated 
included in accounts receivable are unbilled accounts receivable  which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
as the company provides services on projects  it also incurs third party and other pass through costs  which are typically reimbursable by its customers pursuant to the contract 
in certain contracts  however  these costs are fixed by the contract terms 
in these contracts  the company is at risk for costs incurred in excess of the amounts fixed by the contract terms 
in these instances  the company recognizes these costs as direct costs with corresponding net service revenues 
excess costs incurred above the contract terms would negatively affect the company s gross margin 
business combinations sfas no 
 business combinations  requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be recorded at fair value 
fair values are generally determined by management with the assistance of third party valuation specialists using comparisons to market value transactions and present value techniques 
the use of a discounted cash flow technique requires significant judgments with respect to expected cash flows to be derived from the assets  the estimated period of time the assets will produce those cash flows and the selections of an appropriate discount rate 
changes in such estimates could change the amounts allocated to individual identifiable assets  the lives over which the assigned values are amortized and the amounts allocated to 
table of contents goodwill 
while the company believes its assumptions are reasonable  if different assumptions were made  the purchase price allocation and the estimated useful lives of amortizable assets could differ substantially from the reported amounts 
results of operations for acquired entities are included in the company s results of operations from the date of acquisition 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to customers 
unbilled accounts receivable are amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to customers 
advance billings represent amounts billed or payment received for which revenues have not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on historical evidence of accounts receivable collections and specific identification of accounts receivable that might pose collection problems 
the bad debt provision is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a bad debt provision of approximately million related to receivables due from one customer 
with the exception of the million write off referenced above  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has been sufficient to cover any bad debt write offs 
if the company is unable to collect all or part of its outstanding receivables  there could be a material impact to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
long lived assets the company analyzes goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine any potential impairment loss on an annual basis  unless conditions exist that require an updated analysis on an interim basis 
a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
the goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit and is inherently subjective 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds fair value 
at december   and december   the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value  resulting in no goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  the company has an intangible asset representing one customer relationship acquired in the company s acquisition of cpr 
the value of this customer relationship had been million prior to the fourth quarter of and the useful life had been designated as indefinite 
due to declining revenue from this customer in and declining revenue projected for and future years  the company determined that the asset was impaired and recorded an million impairment charge in effective january   the company has assigned a year useful life to the customer relationship 
internally developed software the company capitalizes costs incurred to internally develop software used primarily in the company s proprietary clinical trial and data management systems  and amortizes these costs over the useful life of the product  not to exceed five years 
internally developed software represents software in the application development stage  and there is no assurance that the software development process will produce a final product for which the fair value exceeds its carrying value 
internally developed software is an intangible asset subject to impairment write downs whenever events indicate that the carrying value of the software may not be recoverable 
as with other long lived assets  this asset is reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriateness of the carrying value of the asset 
assessing the fair value of the internally developed software requires estimates and judgment on the part of management 
tax valuation allowance the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient operating income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
if estimates prove inaccurate or if the tax laws change unfavorably  significant revisions in the valuation allowance may be required in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency the company operates on a global basis and is therefore exposed to various types of currency risks 
two specific transaction risks arise from the nature of the contracts the company executes with its customers 
from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net service revenues and resulting net income can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  the company recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing at the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until the payment from the customer is received will result in the company receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by the company as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from local currency into us dollars as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
foreign currency translation adjustments  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet  were approximately million at december   compared to  at december  interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its amounts outstanding under the facility and multicurrency facility
