we are a biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing a portfolio of endocrinology products 
we currently have the following products in our commercialization and development portfolio increlex  which we began commercializing in the united states in january  somatuline autogel  for which a new drug application  or nda  was submitted in to the us food and drug administration  or fda  by ipsen sa  or ipsen  our collaborator  and was approved for marketing in july by health canada for the treatment of acromegaly 
increlex 
we market increlex as a long term replacement therapy for the treatment of children with severe primary insulin like growth factor deficiency  or severe primary igfd  or with growth hormone gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to growth hormone  or growth hormone 
we obtained approval for the long term treatment of severe primary igfd  from the us food and drug administration  or fda  in august we are currently conducting a phase iiib clinical trial for the use of increlex for the treatment of children with primary igfd 
in january  we launched increlex in the united states 
increlex generated net revenues of million in in december  we submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  in the european union for the long term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary igfd or with growth hormone gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to growth hormone 
we expect to receive an opinion from the committee for medicinal products for human use on the increlex maa in the second quarter of pursuant to our worldwide strategic collaboration with ipsen that was finalized in october  we granted to ipsen and its affiliates the exclusive right under our patents and know how to develop and commercialize increlex in all countries of the world except the united states  japan  canada  and for a certain period of time  taiwan and certain countries of the middle east and north africa  for all indications  other than treatment of central nervous system and diabetes indications 
somatuline autogel 
pursuant to our worldwide strategic collaboration with ipsen  we have the exclusive right under ipsen s patents and know how to develop and commercialize somatuline autogel in the united states and canada for all indications other than opthalmic indications 
in july  somatuline autogel was approved for marketing by health canada for the treatment of acromegaly and is currently in the reimbursement review process 
acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results when a tumor in the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone  resulting in overproduction of insulin like growth factor igf and excessive 
table of contents growth 
in october  ipsen submitted an nda to the fda for the use of somatuline autogel for the treatment of acromegaly 
the fda accepted the nda on december   and the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  date for somatuline autogel for the treatment of acromegaly is august  somatuline autogel is an injectable sustained release formulation containing lanreotide  a somatostatin analogue 
the somatuline autogel formulation requires no excipient other than water and is generally injected monthly 
in some patients  the time between injections can be lengthened to up to days 
the product is contained in a pre filled syringe  and can be administered as a deep subcutaneous injection 
in contrast  sandostatin lar  the only currently available  long acting somatostatin analogue  which is marketed by novartis  must be reconstituted from a powdered form and drawn up into a syringe  and must be then be given as a deep intramuscular injection 
like sandostatin lar  somatuline autogel is used primarily when circulating levels of growth hormone remain high despite surgery or radiotherapy in patients with acromegaly 
through its inhibitory effects  somatuline autogel lowers growth hormone and igf levels  thus controlling disease progression and relieving the symptoms associated with active disease 
in october  we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge  which entitles us to sell  and obligates kingsbridge to purchase  a maximum of approximately  newly issued shares of our common stock over a three year period for cash up to an aggregate of million  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
see the discussion below under committed equity financing facility for further details on the ceff 
as of december   we had not issued any shares under this facility 
under the terms of an affiliation agreement we entered into pursuant to our collaboration with ipsen  we have only a limited ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity without first obtaining ipsen s approval  and would generally not have the ability to draw down any funds under the ceff without ipsen s prior approval 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have funded our operations since inception through the private placement of equity securities and public offerings of our common stock  including a follow on public offering of common stock completed on january  in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we also received cash proceeds in connection with our strategic partnership with ipsen as described under liquidity and capital resources ipsen collaboration below 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products and contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits  title passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record provisions for discounts to customers  rebates to government agencies  product returns and other adjustments which are based on our historical experience 

table of contents license revenue includes upfront and continuing licensing fees 
nonrefundable upfront fees that require our continuing involvement in the manufacturing or other commercialization efforts by us are recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual term 
we believe the contractual term is our best estimate for recognition of license revenue which could change in the future if we decide another methodology is appropriate 
stock based compensation prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations  and provided the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of non cash compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  relating to sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  non cash compensation expense has been recognized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and includes the following a compensation expense related to any share based payments granted through  but not yet vested as of january   and b compensation expense for any share based payments granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we recognize non cash compensation expense for the fair values of these share based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards 
because non cash stock compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced by estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our financial statements as of december  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  we recognized stock based compensation expense of million during the year ended december   which primarily affected our reported research and development and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
approximately and million are included in research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  for the year ended december  we calculated this expense based on the fair values of the stock based compensation awards as estimated using the black scholes model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions about expected future volatility of our stock price and the expected term of the options that we grant 
calculating stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r also requires us to make assumptions about expected future forfeiture rates for our option awards 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements previously granted under our various plans was million  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
however  it is difficult to predict the actual amount of share based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods as that expense can be affected by changes in the amount or terms of our share based compensation awards issued in the future  changes in the assumptions used in our model to value those future awards  changes in our stock price  and changes in interest rates  among other factors 
during the period from february  through january   we granted certain stock options with exercise prices that were below the reassessed fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
deferred stock compensation  from inception through january   of million was recorded in accordance with apb opinion no 
 and was being amortized to expense over the related vesting period of the options 
from inception through december   stock based compensation expense of million was recognized and 
table of contents million was reversed as a result of employee terminations 
the remaining deferred stock compensation balance of million as of december  was reversed on january  upon adoption in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
for more information on stock based compensation expense recorded for the year ended december   please refer to note stock based compensation in the notes to financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate potential obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demands for increlex  however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  inventory write downs may be required that could negatively impact our results of operations 
clinical trial expenses we contract with third party clinical research organizations to perform various clinical trial activities 
we recognize research and development expenses for these contracted activities based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other activity based factors 
we match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received from and efforts expended by these third party clinical research organizations 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers  we record prepaid expenses and accruals relating to clinical trials based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events as specified in each clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjust estimates accordingly 
such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
valuation of warrants in order to estimate the value of warrants  we use the black scholes merton valuation model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumption is the estimate of the expected volatility 
the value of a warrant is derived from its potential for appreciation in value 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in the stock price 
we record the value of a warrant to additional paid in capital based on the estimated value  using certain assumptions  at the closing of a warrant transaction 
however  it is difficult to predict the valuation of warrants issued in future periods as that value can be affected by changes in the volatility assumptions of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial statements 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
we began shipment of increlex to specialty pharmacy distributors in january product sales less product returns and cash discounts were million for the year ended december  there were minimal government rebates to state medicaid agencies for the year ended december  as increlex is generally ordered by our distributors to fill specific prescriptions  we believe that our distributors carry minimal levels of inventory 
we also recorded  of amortized license revenue in connection with our increlex license and collaboration agreement with ipsen  or the increlex license 
we are amortizing the upfront payment  received in october of million or million over a period of approximately years see note in the notes to financial statements for further details on our collaboration with ipsen 
there were no revenues in the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa date for somatuline autogel for the treatment of acromegaly is august  somatuline autogel has already received marketing approval in canada and is currently in the reimbursement review process 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales represents the supply cost and cost of production  shipping  distribution and handling costs  royalties owed to our licensor  inventory write downs write offs based on our review of obsolete  excess  expired and failed inventory lots  and other costs related to production activities  including technology transfer and validation cost associated with manufacturing site changes 
cost of product sales was million for the year ended december  which included write offs of inventory totaling million due to manufacturing lot failures as well as costs related to transfer of manufacturing processes to an alternative manufacturer of million 
prior to regulatory approval of increlex in august  drug supply production costs were charged to research and development 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  with the marketing approval of increlex by the fda  we began capitalizing these production costs to inventory and began to charge cost of product sales in the first quarter of as units of increlex were sold 
in addition to these capitalized drug supply production costs  there are also certain variable and fixed shipping  distribution and handling costs charged to cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales may fluctuate over time as the drug supply produced prior to august is sold  as the mix of the fixed versus variable costs change over time  as we execute other production activities  and the percentage of manufacturing lots that are successfully completed 
there was no cost of product sales in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses have consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical  regulatory  manufacturing development activities and acquired rights to technology or products in development 
clinical and regulatory activities include the preparation  implementation  and management of our clinical trials and assay development  as well as regulatory compliance  data management and biostatistics 
manufacturing development activities include pre regulatory approval activities associated with technology transfer  process development and validation  quality control and assurance  analytical services  as well as preparations for current good manufacturing practices cgmp and regulatory inspections 
in addition to these manufacturing development and clinical activities  license payments for patents and know how to develop and commercialize products  are also recorded as research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the million increase was due primarily to a license fee of million paid in october to ipsen related to our somatuline license and collaboration agreement 
see note in the notes to financial statements for further details on our collaboration with ipsen  partially offset by million in lower external project costs  primarily due to lower manufacturing development activities in as compared to and million paid in to genentech related to increlex 
manufacturing development in was focused on production and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process and pre nda activities 

table of contents the million in expense for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of million license fees paid to ipsen  personnel and related costs of million  external project costs related to our clinical activities for primary igfd and severe primary igfd of million  and costs associated with our maa filing activities of million 
excluding the million license fee charged in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in as we continue our clinical activities in primary igfd and severe primary igfd  increlex activities in support of our maa  somatuline autogel activities in acromegaly and other clinical development activities 
our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel  executive management  corporate administration  legal fees  commercial activities  medical education  facility costs  insurance  information technology and accounting services 
we expanded our corporate staffing  infrastructure  and commercial activities in as we prepared for our january launch of increlex  as well as our implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of activities associated with litigation and with marketing increlex for severe primary igfd  medical education and other infrastructure support increased in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the million increase was attributable to additional expenditures associated with sales and marketing activities of million  increased general and administrative personnel and other costs of million  increased legal expenses primarily associated with litigation with insmed of million  increased expenses of million associated with medical education and free goods expense of million  of which million was related to inventory write offs due to manufacturing lot failures and million for inventory write downs 
we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses in to be similar to expenses in we expect that increases in our expenses due to commercial activities associated with somatuline autogel in the united states and canada  will be largely offset by decreased legal costs associated with our litigation with insmed and avecia 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  due to the issuance of our common stock to vll 
interest expense in represented the value of  shares of common stock we issued in in connection with our loan agreement with vll of million and million of commitment fees related to our loan agreement with vll 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to interest income on higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result the cash received from ipsen transaction in october and the impact of higher interest rates in compared to provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  represents million of french foreign income taxes withheld on an upfront license fee received from ipsen under the increlex license 
there is no domestic provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and because we have incurred operating losses to date 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expenses 
upon fda approval for increlex in august  costs associated with manufacturing activities associated with the increlex commercial production were charged to inventory or cost of sales 
manufacturing development activities included in research and development expenses starting in september were primarily in support of our maa as well as clinical supply production 
prior to receiving regulatory approval  we charged all drug supply production costs to research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease of million was primarily due to lower costs related to manufacturing activities  which decreased by million from the same period in manufacturing development expenses in included establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers and cgmp preparations for the anticipated nda filing in severe primary igfd  neither of which were required in  and million of acquired in process research and development primarily related to a license payment to genentech 
costs in associated with our development projects for primary igfd and severe primary igfd decreased by million due primarily to the timing of certain start up clinical trial expenses incurred in these decreases were partially offset by higher personnel costs of million and a milestone payment to genentech of million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the million increase was attributable to increased legal fees of million primarily associated with our litigation with insmed and avecia  increased personnel costs of million and increased corporate administration expenses including consulting  professional fees  insurance  facilities and other expenses of million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  we did not incur any interest expense in the comparable period in interest expense in represented the value of  shares of common stock we issued in in connection with our loan agreement with vll of million and million of commitment fees related to our loan agreement with vll 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to interest income on higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of the cash proceeds received from our initial public offering in march and our follow on public offering in february and the impact of higher interest rates in compared to liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  which was primarily comprised of million of accumulated net losses and million of a non cash deemed dividend related to the beneficial conversion feature of convertible preferred stock 
we have funded our operations and growth from inception through december  with net cash proceeds of in private equity financings and million from our public offerings of common stock and million  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of common stock and a convertible note to ipsen 
committed equity financing facility under the terms of the ceff  kingsbridge committed to purchase a maximum of approximately  newly issued shares of our common stock over a three year period beginning in october  for cash up to an aggregate of million  subject to certain conditions 
we may draw down under the ceff in tranches of up to the lesser of million or of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down of such tranche  
table of contents subject to certain conditions 
the common stock to be issued for each draw down will be issued and priced over an eight day pricing period at discounts ranging from to from the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the pricing period 
during the term of the ceff  kingsbridge may not short our stock  nor may it enter into any derivative transaction directly related to our stock 
the minimum acceptable purchase price  prior to the application of the appropriate discount for any shares to be sold to kingsbridge during the eight day pricing period  is determined by the greater of or of our closing share price on the trading day immediately prior to the commencement of each draw down 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we intend to exercise our right to draw down amounts under the ceff  if and to the extent available  at such times as we have a need for additional capital and when we believe that sales of our common stock under the ceff provide an appropriate means of raising capital 
however  we are not obligated to sell any of the million of common stock available under the ceff  and there are no minimum commitments or minimum use penalties 
under the terms of the affiliation agreement with ipsen  we have only a limited ability to raise capital through the sale of its equity without first obtaining ipsen s approval  and would generally not have the ability to draw down any funds under the ceff without ipsen s prior approval 
convertible note on july   we entered into a stock purchase and master transaction agreement  or the purchase agreement  with ipsen see note in the notes to financial statements ipsen collaboration 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we agreed to issue to ipsen a convertible note in the principal amount of million  or the first convertible note 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  at the first closing  we issued the first convertible note in the principal amount of million to ipsen on october   the first closing 
the first convertible note accrues interest at a rate of per year  compounded quarterly  and is convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment  which represents  shares at december  the number of conversion shares could increase depending on the market value of our common stock 
the entire principal balance and accrued interest under the first convertible note is due and payable on the later to occur of i october   or ii the second anniversary of the date on which ipsen or a subsequent holder of the first convertible note notifies us that it will not convert the first convertible note in full 
as of december   approximately million of interest expense on the first convertible note was accrued 
cash flow cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under a shelf registration and net proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of common stock and the first convertible note to ipsen  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
the increase in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in a follow on public offering  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities from was primarily due to the increase in our net loss in adjusted for the non cash compensation charge of million related to our adoption of fas r compared to  which is discussed above in the results of operations  and the increase in our inventory balance  partially offset by the million received from ipsen for the upfront increlex license fee 
cash used in operating activities in includes the receipt of a million reimbursement from our landlord for facility improvements which was recorded as deferred rent 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities from was primarily due to the increase of our net loss in compared to  which is discussed above in the results of operations  and the capitalization of inventory after we obtained fda approval of increlex  partially offset by the recognition of the leasehold improvement allowance received from our landlord 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities represent purchases  sales and maturities of investments and purchases of property and equipment net against proceeds received from the sale of equipment 
net purchases of short term investments were million in  an increase of million from due to the relatively short term maturities of our investment portfolio during  and  the increases and decreases in net purchases of short term investments were primarily due to timing of maturities  sales and purchases of short term investments 
net purchases of short term investments were million in  an increase of million from purchases of property and equipment were million in  a decrease million from purchases of property and equipment were lower in because leasehold improvements for the new office building recorded in did not continue in purchases of property and equipment were million in  an increase of million from the increase in purchases of property and equipment in primarily relate to the purchase of leasehold improvements and office furniture for our new offices located in brisbane  california  and the purchase of computer equipment and software for new employees hired in proceeds received from the sale of equipment were million in  compared to in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities primarily relate to net proceeds received from our public offerings of common stock  proceeds from the issuance of the first convertible note to ipsen  interest on our cash investments and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
net proceeds received from our public offerings of common stock were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and a convertible note to ipsen were million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our operations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   together with the funds that we would potentially receive from our collaboration with ipsen  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements through at least the middle of based on our current business plan 
however  our future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including changes to our business plan  our ability to market and sell sufficient quantities of increlex and somatuline autogel at the anticipated level  the commercial status of the increlex bulk drug manufacturing operations at lonza baltimore inc  including the success of our cgmp production activities  the success of increlex final drug product manufacturing  the costs  timing and scope of additional regulatory approvals for increlex  ipsen s ability to supply somatuline autogel to us in sufficient quantities  the cost  timing and scope of additional regulatory approvals for somatuline autogel  ipsen s ability to market and sell sufficient quantities of increlex in the licensed territories at the anticipated level  any required repayment of the convertible notes we issued or that we may issue to ipsen  the status of competing products  the rate of progress and cost of our future clinical trials and other research and development activities  and the pace of expansion of administrative and legal expenses 

table of contents due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the costs to complete our projects through product commercialization are not accurately predictable 
results from regulatory review  manufacturing operations and clinical trials may not be favorable 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  our development projects are subject to risks  uncertainties and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
as a result  our capital requirements may increase in future periods 
as a result  we expect that we may require and attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  and the ceff 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed  or  if available  that the terms will be favorable 
in addition  under the terms of an affiliation agreement we entered into pursuant to our collaboration with ipsen  we have only a limited ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity without first obtaining ipsen s approval 
if additional funds are not available  we may be forced to curtail or cease operations 
litigation on december   we initiated patent infringement proceedings against avecia limited and insmed incorporated as co defendants in the high court of justice chancery division patents court in the united kingdom 
on december   we  with genentech  initiated patent infringement proceedings against insmed in the us district court for the northern district of california 
we initiated these proceedings because we believe that insmed and avecia are infringing and or have infringed on our patents that cover insmed s product s use and manufacture 
there were no material developments in our patent infringement litigation against avecia and insmed in the united kingdom during the months ended december  on june   the court issued rulings on several claims construction issues and cross motions for summary judgment in our patent infringement litigation against insmed in the united states
