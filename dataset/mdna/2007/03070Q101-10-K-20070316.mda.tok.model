in the recent past  we led our markets in the introduction of ticket in  ticket out tito technology and fully implementing coinless slot machines at our ameristar branded properties

working together permits us to continually refine these processes and at the same time more efficiently manage our business 
growth strategies we anticipate that our growth will come from disciplined expansions at selected properties and through strategic acquisitions and new developments

in doing so  we assess the anticipated relative costs and benefits of the projects under consideration  the availability of cash flows and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and competitive and other relevant factors

two of these competitors are located in the state of illinois 
unlike the state of missouri  illinois does not impose a per person  per two hour session buy in limit  does not require a casino issued identification card to enter a casino and allows credit play 
however  illinois casinos are limited in the number of gaming positions allowed and are subject to a higher rate of gaming taxes than missouri casinos 
although there were no major capital improvements or expansions in the st

development is underway on an approximately million casino entertainment complex at laclede s landing in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the new facility  which will incorporate a remodeled embassy suites hotel  is slated to open in late and will feature a mix of restaurants  conference space  and a  square foot casino

louis county  approximately miles from our st 
charles property 
the lemay project is expected to include a million hotel and casino entertainment complex and is currently slated for opening in late the existing president casino in downtown st 
louis was purchased by the laclede s landing developer 
this operator has not yet announced its long term plans for this casino 
in east st 
louis  illinois  a gaming operator continues to develop a million casino barge project that is expected to upgrade the current facility in phases prior to the opening of the laclede s landing project 
the initial phase is a million expansion project that will replace the existing  square foot casino 
the new casino will consist of  square feet of casino space and will be located several hundred feet away  which will likely minimize construction disruption 
phase one is expected to be completed in the summer of 
table of contents the second and third phases of the project will include additional restaurants and hotel rooms  a new entertainment facility and a parking garage 
estimated completion dates for the second and third phases have not been announced 
the addition of two gaming licenses in the st 
louis market  as well as any replacement or upgrade to the existing downtown st 
louis or alton casinos  would result in additional competition for ameristar st 
charles 
the state of illinois has one dormant gaming license that it has announced it intends to reissue in the greater chicago area 
accordingly  we do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market 
kansas city ameristar kansas city competes with three other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
a competitor in riverside  missouri  located approximately miles from ameristar kansas city  is currently constructing a room hotel and replacing its parking garage 
the project is slated for completion in the second quarter of the kansas city market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles

council bluffs ameristar council bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued for the council bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with iowa west racing association 
the two other competitors are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a pari mutuel racetrack casino 
in march  the competing racetrack casino opened an million expansion of its land based facility  which includes  square feet of gaming space  a  space parking garage and several other non gaming amenities 
in  the competitor re branded the casino and began to offer table games  poker and video poker in addition to slots 
the expansion and the additional gaming options offered by the racetrack casino have resulted in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
the council bluffs market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with the nearest competing gaming jurisdiction located approximately miles away 
in  a referendum on the statewide ballot that would have legalized video keno machines was defeated  and another measure that would have legalized casino gaming was ruled invalid by the nebraska supreme court 
in the future  the state of nebraska may again consider legalization of casino gaming which  if passed  would likely result in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs

risk factors the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
we may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain customers 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
from time to time  legislation and ballot measures have been unsuccessfully proposed in kansas  nebraska and colorado for the legalization or expansion of gaming 
in nebraska  a referendum on the statewide ballot that would have legalized video keno machines was defeated in november  and another measure that 
table of contents would have legalized casino gaming was ruled invalid by the nebraska supreme court 
in kansas  there are currently bills pending in the legislature that would legalize various forms of commercial gaming 
the expanded legalization of gaming in greater omaha or kansas city  in close proximity to our existing facilities  and the additional competition resulting from the subsequent development of competing gaming properties could have a material adverse effect on us

in january  city officials of sugar creek  missouri  located approximately seven miles from ameristar kansas city  requested the missouri gaming commission to consider granting an additional gaming license in the kansas city market and notified the commission that the city is negotiating an agreement with a privately held casino operator for the operator to develop a casino based entertainment resort in sugar creek 
if the commission were to grant a casino license for this location  the additional competition could materially adversely affect ameristar kansas city s business 
in march  our competitor that operates the pari mutuel racetrack casino in council bluffs rebranded the property as part of a major expansion and renovation 
the property now features significantly more gaming space   slot machines  table games  a poker room and additional non gaming amenities 
prior to a change in iowa law in  racetrack casinos were not permitted to offer table games or video poker machines 
the operating results of ameristar council bluffs have been adversely affected by this additional competition  and we expect that will continue to be the case 
our principal competitors in the st 
louis and black hawk markets have also recently completed  or will soon complete  significant expansions of their facilities 
in vicksburg  several potential gaming sites still exist  and three companies have received preliminary mississippi gaming commission approval for the development of new casinos  although it is not certain if or when those properties will be developed 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
we believe that operating results at our jackpot properties have been adversely affected by intensified competition from an idaho native american facility that is closer to a portion of our market area 
from time to time  the legislatures in kansas and nebraska consider legislation that would allow various forms of native american gaming in close proximity to our properties in kansas city and council bluffs 
additionally  two federally recognized tribes have asserted land claims in colorado and are attempting to have land in metropolitan denver placed in trust by the federal government to be used for casino gaming 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 

table of contents if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits may intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in  in response to an iowa supreme court ruling that decreased the gaming taxes payable by casinos at pari mutuel racetracks  the iowa legislature approved an increase in the maximum tax rate on gaming revenues of all casinos from to  which became effective july  this tax increase has negatively impacted operating income at ameristar council bluffs and will continue to do so 
several bills have been introduced in the missouri legislature in recent years that would increase the gaming tax rate 
a bill is pending in the current session that would raise the adjusted gross gaming receipts tax by one percentage point  cap the number of casino licenses and repeal the buy in limit 
it is too early to predict the outcome of this proposed legislation 
in colorado  the colorado limited gaming control commission has the authority to establish the gaming tax rate on an annual basis  up to a maximum rate of of gross receipts  without further legislative action 
the current rate of on gross receipts over million has been in effect since if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to further increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the buy in limit in missouri  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission  the colorado limited gaming control commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our gaming licenses in missouri need to be renewed every two years  our gaming licenses in iowa and colorado must be renewed or continued every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 

table of contents financial leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
our leverage ratio as defined in our senior credit facilities increased from as of december  to as of december   while our total indebtedness increased from million as of december  to million as of december  as we proceed with our planned capital improvement projects and aggressively seek to grow our business over the next three years  we anticipate that our total debt will increase significantly 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  stock repurchases  dividends and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities contains covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
all of our borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as of february   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
if short term interest rates rise  our interest cost will increase  which will adversely affect our net income and available cash 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  hurricanes  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual 
table of contents design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
the major hurricanes experienced in the gulf coast region in and the resulting reconstruction efforts have exacerbated shortages of certain construction materials and labor and resulted in increased construction costs 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in this regard  on february   we reported that there have been significant cost increases of million and million over our previous budgets on our st 
charles and black hawk hotel projects  respectively  and that our black hawk and vicksburg projects will be completed much later then originally announced  due to various factors 
we employ fast track design and construction methods in most of our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe that the use of fast track design and construction methods can reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve greater construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unforeseen geological conditions may continue to affect our black hawk construction project 
in  as we blasted a portion of the mountain to prepare the foundation for our new hotel under construction at ameristar black hawk  we discovered a subsurface fracture that resulted in a rockslide 
the process of clearing debris from the rockslide and additional engineering required to continue the blasting has delayed the estimated completion date of the project by several months and resulted in additional project costs 
in late february  we identified additional fissures 
our preliminary evaluation indicates that the fissures will delay the completion of the project by approximately three to four months  to the second half of  and may result in additional construction costs 
our black hawk project may experience additional delays and or cost increases due to the unforeseeable site conditions 
our expansion project at ameristar vicksburg presents unique engineering and construction challenges 
we are expanding the casino vessel at ameristar vicksburg and connecting it to the new parking garage under construction at the site 
in order to do so  we will be required to pour a concrete foundation and rest the vessel on permanent supports similar in design to a dry dock while the vessel remains in the existing cofferdam basin 
we plan to do this while the vessel remains in water and without suspending operations at the casino 
this project presents significant engineering and construction challenges and we believe that our combination of methods has never before been attempted under comparable conditions 
we have not been able to procure on practicable terms contractual protections and insurance coverage sufficient to protect us against all possible losses arising out of the project 
if the casino vessel were to sustain significant damage or be required to cease operations for an extended period  our business may be materially adversely affected 
additionally  the project may experience delays and cost increases due to complexities associated with dry docking the vessel 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 

table of contents as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
worsening economic conditions or geopolitical circumstances may adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by economic downturns and instability  as we are dependent on discretionary spending by our customers 
any worsening of current economic conditions or significant increases in energy prices could cause fewer people to spend money at our properties and could adversely affect our revenues 
other geopolitical events  such as terrorism or the threat of terrorism  may deter customers from visiting our properties 
we have limited opportunities to develop new properties 
the casino gaming industry has limited new development opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources and name recognition than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business through new development 
our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking 
legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions  including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in  statewide smoking bans were enacted by the legislature in colorado and by voter initiative in nevada  both of which contain exemptions for casino floors 
recently  a bill was introduced in the colorado legislature that would repeal the casino floor exemption 
if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the estate of craig h 
neilsen owns a majority of our common stock and controls our affairs 
craig h 
neilsen  our founder and former chairman of the board and chief executive officer  died on november  at the time of his death  mr 
neilsen beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of his death  these shares passed by operation of law to mr 
neilsen s estate the estate 
the co personal representatives of the estate are ray h 
neilsen  our co chairman of the board and vice president of operations and special projects  and gordon r 
kanofsky  our co chairman of the board and executive vice president 
accordingly  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky jointly have the ability to control our operations and affairs  including the election of the entire board of directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  other matters that may be submitted to a vote of the stockholders  including a merger  consolidation or sale of our assets 
as a result  actions that may be supported by a majority of the other stockholders  including the issuance of additional shares of common stock to finance acquisitions or other growth opportunities  could be blocked by messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky 
in addition  the estate s ownership affects the liquidity in the market for our common stock 
craig h 
neilsen s estate plan provides that  shares of our common stock owned by the estate or approximately of our shares currently outstanding will ultimately pass to the craig h 
neilsen foundation  a private foundation primarily focused on funding spinal cord injury research and treatment the foundation 
messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky serve as the co trustees of the foundation  and they also serve 
table of contents on the foundation s five person board of directors 
as officers and or directors of aci  personal representatives of the estate and trustees and directors of the foundation  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky are subject to certain conflicts of interest 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event the estate or its beneficiaries  including the foundation  sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they might have to do in order to pay estate tax liabilities or satisfy legal requirements applicable to shareholdings by private foundations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
our business may be adversely affected by our ability to retain and attract key personnel 
we depend on the continued performance of our entire senior executive team  including john m 
boushy  our chief executive officer and president  who joined us in august and became chief executive officer following mr 
neilsen s unexpected death in november as a result  if we lose the services of any of our key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
we currently have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions 
recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel is particularly difficult at ameristar vicksburg  ameristar black hawk and the jackpot properties due to their geographic locations 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as we recruit personnel  we expect successful candidates to exhibit a collaborative  communicative and collegial nature 
we also employ a high degree of centralization in a highly decentralized industry 
we use multi faceted recruitment  assessment and interviewing approaches that include several levels of interactions and interviews over a period of time 
these factors create risk in attracting management personnel in a timely fashion  as well as hiring candidates we expect to be successful within our company 
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  as well as natural disasters  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition 
table of contents would be adversely affected 
we have very limited insurance coverage for earthquake damage at our properties 
several of our properties  particularly ameristar st 
charles  are located near historically active earthquake faults 
in the event one of our properties were to sustain significant damage from an earthquake  our business could be materially adversely affected 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and barge facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel currently floats and where we are dry docking the vessel on a concrete foundation  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps  if any  may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or barge facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities in an amount that we are unable to reasonably estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our credit agreement 
we could face severe penalties and material remediation costs if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
as is the case with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts  which could adversely affect our operations 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities

risk factors 
overview we develop  own and operate casinos and related hotel  food and beverage  entertainment and other facilities  with seven properties in operation in missouri  iowa  mississippi  colorado and nevada 
our portfolio of casinos consists of ameristar st 
charles  serving greater st 
louis  missouri  ameristar kansas city  serving the kansas city  missouri metropolitan area  ameristar council bluffs  serving omaha  nebraska and southwestern iowa  ameristar vicksburg  serving jackson  mississippi and monroe  louisiana  cactus petes and the horseshu in jackpot  nevada  serving idaho and the pacific northwest  and ameristar black hawk  serving the denver  colorado metropolitan area 
we acquired ameristar black hawk on december  our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those patrons spend per visit 
management uses various metrics to evaluate these factors 
key metrics include slots handle table games drop measurements of gaming volume  win hold percentages the percentage of handle or drop that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue  hotel occupancy rate the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  average daily room rate average price of occupied hotel rooms per day  revpar revenue per available room is a summary measure of hotel results that combines average daily room rate and hotel occupancy rate  market share share of gross gaming revenues in each of our markets other than jackpot and our share of gaming devices in the jackpot market nevada does not publish separate gaming revenue statistics for this market  fair share percentage a percentage of gross gaming revenues based on the number of gaming positions relative to the total gaming positions in the market  admissions the number of patrons who enter our casinos in jurisdictions that record admissions  and win per admission the amount of gaming revenues generated per admission 
our operating results may be affected by  among other things  competitive factors  gaming tax increases  the commencement of new gaming operations  charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities  general public sentiment regarding travel  overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our patrons and weather conditions affecting our properties 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 

table of contents the following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance ameristar black hawk 
on april   we rebranded our renovated and expanded casino in black hawk  colorado 
ameristar black hawk  formerly known as mountain high  now features an expanded parking garage with  parking spaces  refurbished and rebranded dining venues  additional gaming space   slot machines and an upscale star club for our top players 
for the last three quarters of  the property experienced significant growth in business volume and strong improvement in financial performance following the casino expansion and rebranding  as evidenced by increases in net revenues and operating income of and  respectively  over the last three quarters of the property s financial performance was adversely impacted by construction disruption throughout and during the first quarter of additionally  ameristar black hawk was adversely affected during most of the third quarter of by the temporary closure of a principal highway connecting black hawk and denver 
post hurricane improvement at ameristar vicksburg 
in  ameristar vicksburg increased operating income by million  or  over the improved financial performance of this property is mostly attributable to reduced mississippi gulf coast gaming capacity caused by hurricane katrina in august in  business volumes and our financial performance continued to surpass results prior to hurricane katrina despite the reopening of several gulf coast casinos during the year 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to experience declines in our vicksburg property s financial performance relative to the fourth quarter 
we expect the property s business volumes and financial performance for each of the first three quarters of to decline  as compared to the same quarterly periods in  mostly as a result of the restored gulf coast gaming capacity 
increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
ameristar council bluffs faced enhanced competition following the march completion of a major expansion and rebranding of a nearby land based casino 
for the year ended december   our council bluffs property experienced a million decrease in operating income and a percentage point decline in operating income margin as compared to during  our council bluffs property benefited from significant construction disruption and a reduced number of available slot machines at the competing casino 
profit maximization 
we continue to see the positive impact from our efforts to utilize promotional allowances and labor more efficiently 
during the last two quarters of  we decreased our promotional allowances as a percentage of gaming revenues by percentage points compared to the same period in the prior year  and we expect this trend to continue in in addition to more effective promotional spending  we are continuing to achieve further efficiencies through improved labor management and cost containment practices 
the successful application of these strategies was most evident at our st 
charles property  where revenues declined million from the prior year while operating income margin improved percentage point over promotional spending and marketing 
for the year ended december   promotional allowances at our properties increased million over the increase in our rate of promotional spending was partially attributable to our ongoing efforts to strengthen the ameristar brand through targeted marketing  as evidenced by an overall increase in rated play from to in addition to improving rated play  our marketing and promotional spending in also increased  particularly in the first quarter of  as a result of competitive pressures in the missouri and iowa markets 
as indicated above  we believe we addressed these competitive challenges with more efficient promotional spending  resulting in decreased promotional allowances in the second half of as compared to the last six months of renovations and enhancements at ameristar st 
charles 
at ameristar st 
charles  we continue to make progress on the construction of a room  all suite hotel with an indoor outdoor swimming 
table of contents pool and a  square foot full service spa  and an additional  space parking garage 
the hotel is designed to surpass four diamond quality standards and we believe it will be the premier hotel in greater st 
louis 
we completed and opened  square feet of new meeting and conference facilities in the third quarter of and the initial  spaces of the parking garage in february the total cost of these ongoing and recently completed projects is expected to be million  representing an increase of million over the original budget 
the revised cost is mostly attributable to upgraded design and finishes intended to enhance the guest experience  greater than anticipated site preparation costs and an increase in the cost of materials 
the completion date of the hotel and the remainder of the project is expected to be december we believe these new amenities will allow us to further enhance our competitive position in the st 
louis market 
ameristar black hawk hotel project 
the construction of our four diamond quality hotel is progressing at ameristar black hawk 
the story tower s well appointed  oversized rooms will feature upscale furnishings and amenities 
the tower will include a versatile meeting and ballroom center and will also have black hawk s only full service spa  an enclosed rooftop swimming pool and indoor outdoor whirlpool facilities 
once completed  ameristar black hawk will offer destination resort amenities and services that we believe are unprecedented in the denver gaming market 
the hotel s scheduled completion date has been delayed until the second half of  primarily due to unforeseen site conditions and inclement weather 
the cost of the hotel is expected to be million  representing an increase of million over the previous budget 
the revised cost estimate is mostly attributable to an increase in materials costs  the unforeseen site conditions and upgraded finishes and amenities designed to enhance the guest experience 
expansion project at ameristar vicksburg 
we are continuing to progress with a multi phase casino and parking expansion project at ameristar vicksburg 
the first phase of the project will require dry docking the vessel and will add gaming positions  two new restaurants  a vip club  retail space and a parking garage to the property  and is expected to be completed by march we believe these improvements will help to alleviate long standing capacity constraints  provide more convenient access and increase our long time market dominance in vicksburg 
the second phase of the project will feature improvements to the existing casino layout and flow as well as enhancements to existing non gaming amenities  and is expected to be completed in the second half of the total cost for both phases of the project is expected to be million 
in addition to the vicksburg projects noted above  we expect to commence a million renovation of the hotel in august external development costs 
development activities have contributed to our corporate expense as we continue to pursue growth through acquisition and other development opportunities 
development related costs totaled million in compared to million in the decrease in costs is mostly attributable to reduced efforts in the united kingdom and the termination in november of our pursuit of a casino license application in pennsylvania 
in april  we submitted a proposal to acquire a publicly traded us based gaming operator 
the gaming operator received several competing proposals and we ultimately determined not to further pursue the acquisition 
in connection with this proposed acquisition  professional fees and internal costs totaled approximately million 
as part of our continued pursuit of external expansion opportunities  we expect to incur future development costs  the amounts of which we cannot currently determine 
stock based compensation expense 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments eg  stock options granted to employees 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in a pre tax non cash operating expense of million for the year ended december

the black hawk property benefited from the rebranding and reduced construction disruption following the completion of the initial phase of our expansion activities in the first quarter of our vicksburg property s improved financial performance and the growth in the overall vicksburg market are mostly attributable to the third quarter closure of the mississippi gulf coast casinos following hurricane katrina 
consolidated casino revenues for increased million over the prior year  principally due to a million increase in slot revenues at ameristar black hawk  which now features an additional slot machines on its expanded casino floor 
we further believe consolidated casino revenues increased in part as a result of the continued successful implementation of our targeted marketing programs  as evidenced by an overall increase in rated play at our properties over for the years ended december  and  promotional allowances as a percentage of casino revenues remained unchanged at 
our strategy to maximize profitability through efficient promotional spending during the second half of offset the increased promotional spending during the first half of that was primarily caused by competitive pressures at our council bluffs and missouri properties 
operating income in  consolidated operating income increased million  or  over  while consolidated operating income margin decreased by percentage point from the prior year 
the growth in operating income was substantially attributable to ameristar black hawk s and ameristar vicksburg s strong financial performances 
ameristar black hawk s financial results included million in non recurring costs related to the rebranding 
the financial performance of our black hawk and vicksburg properties was partially offset by the results of our council bluffs property  which experienced declines in operating income and the related margin from the prior year as a result of enhanced competition 
consolidated operating income was adversely affected by the million in stock based compensation expense we were required to recognize beginning in consolidated operating income was also impacted by an million increase in depreciation and amortization expense over  primarily due to million in depreciation expense from the capital improvements placed in service as part of the ameristar black 
table of contents hawk expansion 
we anticipate that depreciation expense will continue to rise as a result of our ongoing major capital projects at st 
charles  black hawk and vicksburg 
finally  health benefit costs in decreased by million compared to the prior year 
it is not possible to predict with accuracy future health benefit costs  as they are dependent on a number of factors beyond our control  including the frequency and severity of large claims 
however  we would expect to experience an increase in health benefit costs in interest expense the following table summarizes information related to interest on our long term debt years ended december  dollars in thousands interest cost less capitalized interest interest expense  net cash paid for interest  net of amounts capitalized weighted average total debt balance outstanding weighted average interest rate for the year ended december   consolidated interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  decreased million from the decrease is due primarily to a reduced average interest rate resulting from a november refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and a february redemption of our senior subordinated notes with borrowings under our new credit facility at substantially lower interest rates 
the interest savings resulting from the lower interest rates were partially offset by an increase from of million in the weighted average total debt balance outstanding 
as we continue to progress on our major construction projects  we expect that our debt will increase further 
additionally  when we place those assets in service over the next three years  we will no longer capitalize the interest on the associated debt  which will cause our net interest expense to rise 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in and in the federal income tax statutory rate was in both years 
the rise in our effective tax rates is mostly attributable to increased pre tax income generated by our properties located in states with higher income tax rates 
net income for the year ended december   consolidated net income decreased million  or  from the year ended december  we incurred a pre tax charge in the first quarter of relating to the loss on redemption of our senior subordinated notes of approximately million that adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by

table of contents year ended december  versus year ended december  net revenues consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the prior year 
all our ameristar branded properties improved their net revenues in at ameristar council bluffs  our net revenues in increased over the prior year partially as a result of significant construction disruption and a reduced number of available slot machines at the competing racetrack casino 
our vicksburg property s improved financial performance over and the overall growth in the vicksburg market were mostly due to the closure of the gulf coast casinos following hurricane katrina 
our black hawk property contributed million to the increase in consolidated annual net revenues in casino revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from  including increases in slot and poker revenues of and  respectively 
our black hawk property contributed million to the increase in casino revenues over the day period during which we owned the property in the increased gaming revenues are mostly attributable to the continued improvement in our slot product and the other factors described above 
we further believe casino revenues increased in part as a result of our continued successful implementation of our targeted marketing programs  which is evidenced by the increase in rated play at our ameristar branded properties excluding our black hawk property when compared to consolidated promotional allowances increased by million  or  over the prior year  primarily as a result of increased competition in our iowa and missouri markets and our targeted marketing efforts mentioned above 
the black hawk property also contributed million to the increase in consolidated promotional allowances during operating income in  consolidated operating income increased million  or  over  while consolidated operating income margin decreased by percentage points from the prior year 
the growth in operating income was substantially attributable to ameristar vicksburg s strong financial performance following the closure of the gulf coast casinos by hurricane katrina 
the vicksburg property s financial results were somewhat offset by greater than expected construction disruption at our black hawk property  higher corporate costs and increased competitive pressures experienced by our missouri and iowa properties  which negatively impacted consolidated operating income and the related margin 
additionally  consolidated operating income and the related margin were adversely impacted by increases in employee compensation and related benefits and depreciation expense at ameristar st 
charles and by the temporary closure of a principal highway between black hawk and denver in the third quarter of we believe that the improvements in operating income and operating income margin at our kansas city and council bluffs properties were mostly attributable to the effective implementation of cost containment initiatives 
our jackpot properties benefited from a reduction in entertainment and marketing costs 
corporate expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  over  primarily as a result of additional employee compensation and benefit costs and increased development activities 
interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was million in compared to million in total interest cost in was million  an increase of million over the increase is due primarily to a rise in our average libor based interest rate on our senior credit facilities year 
table of contents over year and  to a lesser extent  an increase in our long term debt level resulting from the million borrowed in december to acquire our black hawk property 
the increases in the average interest rate and long term debt level were partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense resulting from the termination of our interest rate swap agreement on march  and an increase in capitalized interest from million in to million in capitalized interest in primarily related to the capital improvement projects at our black hawk property and the hotel room renovations at our council bluffs and kansas city properties 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in and in the federal income tax statutory rate was in both years 
the differences from the statutory rate are due to state income taxes and the effect of certain expenses we incurred that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
net income net income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in and diluted earnings per share increased to in from in our net income and diluted earnings per share in increased primarily as a result of revenue growth for the reasons mentioned above  as partially offset by increases in depreciation expense  corporate costs and losses on early retirement of debt

table of contents cash flows from operating activities our business is primarily conducted on a cash basis 
accordingly  operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income 
the decline in operating cash flows from to was attributable in part to increases in income tax cash payments and debt service payments and the decrease in net income as discussed above 
the increase in operating cash flows from to was chiefly the result of the improvement in consolidated operating income during  a million increase in deferred taxes and positive changes in several of our working capital assets and liabilities

see capital expenditures and liquidity for further discussion of capital expenditures 
during  we paid million  net of million of acquired cash  issued million of common stock and assumed million of long term debt in connection with the acquisition of our black hawk property 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were significantly impacted by the following the february  redemption of our senior subordinated notes with borrowings under our revolving loan facility  the november  borrowing of million as a term loan under our new credit facility  of which million was used to repay the principal amount of loans outstanding under our prior senior credit facilities  with the balance being held to provide funding for future capital needs  debt borrowings primarily to fund capital improvement projects  the december  borrowing of million under our senior credit facilities in order to fund the acquisition of our black hawk property  principal payments on long term debt  prepayments of million and million on our senior credit facilities in and  respectively  dividend payments  proceeds from employee stock option exercises  the repurchase of million shares of common stock at a cost of million under our stock repurchase program during  and debt issuance costs relating to the new credit facility

capital expenditures made in totaled million of which million was capitalized interest and included million for slot equipment and related technology  million for long lived assets relating to various capital maintenance at all our properties  million related to the council bluffs and kansas city hotel room renovations  and million for information technology projects 
our senior credit facilities limit our aggregate capital expenditures to billion during the period from november  to november  liquidity at december   our principal debt outstanding consisted of million under the revolving loan facility and million under the term loan facility 
as of december   the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was million  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
all mandatory principal repayments have been made through december  as discussed above  on november   we obtained a billion senior secured credit facility that includes a million seven year term loan facility and a five year revolving loan facility with capacity for borrowing up to million 
the proceeds from the term loan were primarily used to repay all million principal amount of loans outstanding under the replaced senior secured credit facilities 
the new credit facility features lower interest rate add ons compared to our previous senior secured credit facilities and  together with operating cash flows  will provide the funding for our existing capital improvement projects 
we also used proceeds of the new facility to fund the redemption in february of our senior subordinated notes  which we expect will result in a further significant reduction in our borrowing costs  as discussed below 
the revolving loan facility includes a million letter of credit sub facility and a million swingline loan sub facility 
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  we will have the option to increase the total amount available under the new credit facility by up to an additional million  in the form of incremental term loans or additional borrowings under the revolving facility 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
on february   we redeemed all million outstanding principal amount of the senior subordinated notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus million in accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the retirement of the notes resulted in a one time charge for loss on early retirement of debt in the first quarter of of approximately million on a pre tax basis 
at december   we had available million of state net operating loss carryforwards that relate to our missouri properties and may be applied against future taxable income 
at december   we also 
table of contents had available million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards  which were acquired as part of the ameristar black hawk acquisition 
these acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to irs change of ownership limitations 
accordingly  the future utilization of the carryforwards is subject to an annual base limitation of million that can be applied against future taxable income 
the remaining unused federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through during the years ended december  and  we made federal and state income tax payments totaling million and million  respectively 
as of december   in addition to the million available for borrowing under the senior credit facilities  we had million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of which were required for daily operations 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
we anticipate spending approximately million on maintenance capital expenditures including the acquisition of slot machines and other long lived assets and approximately million on internal expansion projects 
actual capital expenditures will depend on the start date of certain projects and the progress of construction through year end 
as described in more detail above  our current major internal expansion projects include construction of the room  all suite hotel with an indoor outdoor swimming pool and a  square foot full service spa  and an additional  space parking garage at ameristar st 
charles  construction of the room  four diamond quality hotel with related amenities and services at ameristar black hawk  and the casino and parking expansion project and the planned hotel renovation at ameristar vicksburg 
historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and availability under our senior credit facilities will be able to support our operations and liquidity requirements  including all of our currently planned capital expenditures and dividend payments on our common stock 
however  if our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet such needs  we will be required to seek additional financing or scale back our capital plans 
we would likely have to obtain additional debt financing if we undertake major acquisitions or new development projects 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us  including our ability to fund daily operations and to satisfy debt covenants 
our ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facilities at any time is primarily dependent upon the amount of our ebitda  as defined for purposes of our senior credit facilities  for the preceding four fiscal quarters 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission regulation s k 

table of contents contractual and other commitments the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contracts  including long term debt obligations  capitalized leases  operating leases and certain construction contracts 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations after total long term debt instruments estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases material construction contracts total estimated interest payments on long term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding after giving effect to projected borrowings in and forecasted libor rates for our senior secured credit facilities 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commitments after total letters of credit our cash tax payments for are expected to be approximately million 
another significant operating use of cash in is interest payments 
our cash interest payments  excluding capitalized interest  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash interest payments may increase in as a result of a possible rise in interest rates and an expected increase in the average outstanding debt balance from anticipated borrowings under the million revolving loan facility to fund our capital improvement projects 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
in december  we assumed several agreements with the missouri highway transportation development district development district that had been entered into in order to assist the development district in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the ameristar kansas city property prior to our purchase of that property 
in order to pay for the highway improvement project  the development district issued revenue bonds totaling million in principal amount with scheduled maturities from through we have issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a bank in support of obligations of the development district for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds 
the amount outstanding under this letter of credit was million as of december  and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds 
additionally  we are obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds as well as any costs incurred by the development district that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy 
table of contents the bondholders 
through december   we had paid million in shortfalls and other costs 
as required by the agreements  we anticipate that we will be reimbursed for these shortfall payments by the development district from future available cash flow  as defined  and have recorded a corresponding receivable as of december  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our revolving loan facility 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired at december   we had approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of the missouri properties in december as required by sfas no 
 we completed our annual assessment for impairment and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the assessment requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine its estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
star awards program our customer reward program  star awards  allows customers to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
customers can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a customer does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were accrued under this program 
the value of these point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services are netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 

table of contents cash coupons our former  current and future gaming customers may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play  are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days and are redeemable only on a return visit 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we utilize actuaries who consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities  based upon statistical data provided by the independent third party administrators of the various programs 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
accounting for share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
these fair values are calculated by using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the term of the option 
sfas no 
r revised sfas no 
and superseded apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this transition method  the future compensation cost related to all equity instruments granted prior to but not yet vested as of adoption is recognized based on the grant date fair value  which is estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
the grant date fair value of the awards is generally recognized as expense over the service period 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and update that number based on actual forfeitures 
previously  we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
with respect to the determination of the pool of windfall tax benefits  we elected to use the transition election of fasb staff position no 
fas r the short cut method as of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
income taxes we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states and state income taxes in several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and million of deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments 
table of contents about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on historical precedent 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any probable adverse outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
recently issued accounting standards fin in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin provides that a company may recognize the impact of a tax position in its financial statements only if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective in the first quarter of  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements 
sab in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors 
the requirements of sab are effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab in had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies how to measure fair value as permitted under other accounting pronouncements  but does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
as of january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facilities  bearing interest at variable rates 
the senior credit facilities bear interest equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin  or add on 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities was 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost by approximately million 
substantially all of our long term debt is subject to variable interest rates 
we continue to monitor interest 
table of contents rate markets and  in order to control interest rate risk  may enter into interest rate collar or swap agreements or other derivative instruments as market conditions warrant 
we may also choose to refinance a portion of our variable rate debt through the issuance of long term fixed rate securities
