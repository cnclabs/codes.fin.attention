ebitda adjusted for other non cash items represents earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  plus net interest expense  depreciation  amortization expense and other non cash items 
ebitda adjusted for other non cash items is not presented as  and should not be considered  an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  but is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt 
while commonly used  however  ebitda is not identically calculated by companies presenting ebitda and is  therefore  not necessarily an accurate means of comparison  and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by our competitors 
we believe that ebitda adjusted for other non cash items is useful to both management and investors in their analysis of our ability to service and repay our debt 
further  we use ebitda adjusted for other non cash items for planning and forecasting in future periods

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flow from operations  equity issuances and debt financings 
working capital needs and capital equipment requirements have increased as a result of our growth and are expected to continue to increase as a result of anticipated growth 
anticipated increases in required working capital and capital equipment expenditures are expected to be met primarily from cash flow from operations  equity issuances and debt financing 
as of december   we had net working capital of million 
we generated cash from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  net cash generated from continuing operating activities was primarily the result of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and impairment charges of million offset by increases in net working capital of million to support increases in sales and related production activities 
we used cash from investing activities of million for the year ended december  this net cash outflow was the result of the acquisition of pullman for million  the purchase of property  plant and 
table of contents equipment of million and the purchase of preferred stock of set for million offset by the sale of property  plant  and equipment of million and proceeds from notes receivable of million 
we obtained million of cash from financing activities for the year ended december  this net cash inflow was driven by borrowings on our credit facilities of million including a million term loan pursuant to the acquisition of pullman and borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit 
in addition we received proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million offset by net payments on long term debt at our mexico facilities of million  dividend payments of million  redemption of a portion of our convertible notes of million and financing fees related to the amended credit facility and convertible notes of million 
in march  we issued the convertible notes in a private placement 
the convertible notes had an initial three year term  maturing on march  and could have been extended another three years at the holders option 
the convertible notes were convertible at the holders option any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at per share adjusted for the stock split subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes 
the interest rate on the convertible notes was fixed for the entire term at 
proceeds from the convertible notes were used to reduce our bank borrowings  including paying off the then existing term loan balance and reducing amounts outstanding under the then existing revolving credit facility 
the holders of the convertible notes had a right to participate in dividends declared and paid to our common shareholders to the extent that such dividends exceeded per share adjusted for the stock split in any twelve month period within the initial three year term of the convertible notes 
the holders participation rights were only on the amount  if any  in excess of per share adjusted for the stock split 
the holders were not entitled to participate in any dividends after the initial three year term 
pursuant to an amendment to the convertible notes during the fourth quarter  the holders of the convertible notes were no longer able to participate in dividends 
as part of this amendment  there was a covenant put in place restricting us from paying dividends or distributions on our common stock in excess of per share adjusted for the stock split in any twelve month period until march this amendment eliminated the requirement to use the two class method for calculating basic earnings per share for future periods relating to the convertible notes 
the terms of the convertible notes included a right of the holders of the convertible notes to convert the convertible notes into our common stock at per share adjusted for the stock split 
we evaluated this right to determine if it gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument that would need to be accounted for separately in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
we concluded that certain provisions which were contingent upon a change in control and allowed for a net cash settlement of the conversion option qualified as an embedded derivative and did not meet the scope exceptions of sfas therefore  we were required to bifurcate the conversion option and establish the fair value of the embedded derivative separate from the debt instrument and record it as a derivative liability 
at issuance of the convertible notes  the holders conversion right had an estimated initial fair value of million  which was recorded as a discount to the convertible notes and a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
the discount on the convertible notes was being accreted to par value over the term of the convertible notes through non cash charges to interest expense over the initial three year term 
the derivative liability associated with the conversion option was adjusted for changes in fair value over the period of time during which the embedded derivative existed with the corresponding charge or credit to other expense or income 
the estimated fair value of the holder s conversion option was determined using a convertible bond valuation model which utilized assumptions including the historical stock price  volatility  risk free interest rate  credit spreads  remaining maturity  and the current stock price 
on november   we entered into an amendment to the convertible notes which incorporated changes that eliminated the embedded derivative liability associated with the convertible notes 
as a result of eliminating the embedded derivative liability  we were no longer required to value the derivative after november  the change in value of the derivative liability from september  to november  
table of contents resulted in a charge of million 
the value of the derivative liability of million as of november  was netted against the balance of debt discount 
in september  we repurchased million of the convertible notes at par 
this repurchase resulted in the acceleration of million in debt discount amortization and the write off of million of deferred financing fees 
these charges were recognized in interest expense in the third quarter in october  we amended and restated the remaining million of convertible notes 
these amended and restated convertible notes carried an interest of per annum and an initial conversion price of 
this conversion price was subject to a mandatory reset to of the day trailing average closing common stock price at july  the amended and restated convertible notes mature in october  and we have certain redemption call rights in october the amended and restated convertible notes do not restrict our payment of dividends 
pursuant to the amendment of the convertible notes  we accelerated the remaining million in debt discount amortization on the convertible notes and wrote off the remaining million of deferred financing fees 
these charges were recognized in interest expense in the fourth quarter during  we recognized million of debt discount amortization in interest expense on the convertible notes in addition to the combined million of debt discount amortization that was accelerated due to the repurchase in september and the amendment in october the terms of the amended and restated convertible notes included a provision whereby the conversion price would reset to of the day trailing average closing common stock price at july  we evaluated the conversion option and this reset provision to determine if an embedded derivative instrument would be required to be accounted for separately in accordance with sfas and eitf eitf states that for certain contracts  the number of shares that could be required to be delivered upon net share settlement is essentially indeterminate 
if the number of shares that could be required to be delivered to net share settle a contract is indeterminate  we will be unable to conclude that we have sufficient available authorized and un issued shares 
therefore  net share settlement is not within our control 
due to the reset provision within the amended and restated convertible notes  the number of shares that would have been delivered upon a potential conversion was indeterminate and could have exceeded the total authorized shares and therefore cash could have been required to satisfy the equivalent value of shares to be delivered upon conversion 
because of the potential delivery of cash  the conversion option was required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability at its fair value 
at issuance of the amended and restated convertible notes  the holders conversion right had an estimated initial fair value of million  which was recorded as a discount to the amended and restated convertible notes and as a derivative liability 
the discount on the amended and restated convertible notes is being accreted to par value over the term of the amended and restated convertible notes through non cash charges to interest expense 
the derivative liability associated with the conversion option is adjusted for changes in fair value over the term of the amended and restated convertible notes with the corresponding charge or credit to other income or expense 
the value of the convertible option derivative liability at december  was million 
during the fourth quarter  we recognized a million charge for the change in value of the convertible option derivative liability 
the estimated fair value of the holders conversion option is determined using a convertible bond valuation model which utilizes assumptions including the historical stock price  volatility  risk free interest rate  credit spreads  remaining maturity  and the current stock price 
in the fourth quarter  we recognized million of debt discount amortization in interest expense for the amended and restated convertible notes 
the balance of the debt discount at december  was million 
in january  we further amended the amended and restated convertible notes to  among other things  set the conversion price at  eliminate the reset provision  and increase the interest rate to

table of contents critical accounting policies a summary of the critical accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follow below 
revenue recognition 
consistent with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue is realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped to our customers and title transfers under standard commercial terms or when realizable in accordance with our commercial agreements 
we participate in steel re sale programs with several of our customers 
as a participant in these programs  we purchase steel from the customer  blank and weld the steel  and re sell a finished laser welded blank to the customer 
we record sales for the cost of steel sold to the customer plus a mark up and record the cost of the steel in cost of sales 
this accounting treatment is consistent with eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we act as principal in the transaction  take title to the products  and have risks and rewards of ownership 
we record amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling in sales and costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
this accounting treatment is consistent with eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
customer tooling 
when we incur costs to design  develop  and build dies and other tooling that will be owned by the customer  we expense these costs unless we have a written contractual guarantee for reimbursement of all design and development costs 
reimbursable costs incurred for customer tooling are reported as a current asset in unbilled customer tooling 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
because we operate in different geographic locations  including several state and local tax jurisdictions  the nature of our tax provisions and the evaluation of our ability to use all recognized deferred tax assets are complex 
in assessing the ability to realize such deferred tax assets  we review the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the projections of taxable income in future periods and the effectiveness of various tax planning strategies in making assessments 
the consideration of these matters requires significant management judgment in determining deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
while we believe that the appropriate valuations of deferred tax assets have been made  unforeseen changes in tax legislation  regulatory activities  operating results  financing strategies  organization structure and other related matters may result in material changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
goodwill other intangible assets 
we record goodwill when the cost of the acquisition exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired 
as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate at least annually the carrying value of our businesses and determine if any goodwill impairment exists

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were approximately of net sales for fiscal our primary foreign currency exposures are the canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen and australian dollar 
in general  we manage our exposure to foreign currency assets  liabilities and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency and matching revenues with expenses in the same currency  as such  certain exposures are naturally offset 
however  at december   our mexico operations  whose functional currency is the mexican peso  had net us dollar liability exposure of approximately million 
based upon this exposure  for every one percent increase decrease in the value of the mexican peso versus the us dollar  we would recognize a foreign currency transaction gain loss of approximately million 
additionally  our mexico operations which were acquired as part of the pullman acquisition have debt denominated in japanese yen 
the balance of this debt at december  was million 
based on this exposure  for every one percent increase decrease in the value of the japanese yen versus the us dollar  we would recognize a foreign currency transaction gain loss of approximately million 
we recognized a foreign exchange transaction gain of million for the year ended december  and a foreign currency transaction loss of million for the year ended december  interest rate sensitivity our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates due primarily to our various credit facilities containing variable interest rates when we borrow under these credit facilities 
the balance of our variable interest rate debt as of december  was million 
based upon this exposure  for every annualized one percent increase decrease in the us and foreign interest rates  we would recognize an additional annualized interest expense benefit of million 
we invest any excess cash balances in overnight and other short term investments which may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we do not hold any other financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk
