item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a non operating holding company whose income is derived from the earnings of our five wholly owned subsidiaries 
we are engaged primarily in the collection  storage  treatment and distribution of potable water for domestic  industrial  commercial and fire protection service in southern and central new hampshire through our three utility subsidiaries pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield 
our water utility revenues constituted of our consolidated revenues in pennichuck water  our principal subsidiary which was established in  accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
pennichuck water s franchise area presently includes the city of nashua  new hampshire and surrounding municipalities 
our water subsidiaries are regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission new hampshire puc and must obtain new hampshire puc approval to increase their water rates to recover increases in operating expenses and to obtain the opportunity to earn a return on investments in plant and equipment 
new hampshire law provides that utilities are entitled to charge rates which permit them to earn a reasonable return on the cost of the property employed in serving its customers  less accrued depreciation  contributed capital and deferred income taxes rate base 
the cost of capital permanently employed by a utility in its utility business marks the minimum rate of return which a utility is lawfully entitled to earn on its rate base 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the new hampshire puc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the new hampshire puc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
the businesses of our two other subsidiaries are non regulated water management services and real estate development and investment 
service corporation provides various non regulated water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities in and around southern and central new hampshire 
its most significant contracts are with the town of hudson  new hampshire and the town of salisbury  massachusetts 
southwood is actively engaged in real estate planning  development and management of residential  commercial  industrial and retail properties 
historically  most of southwood s activities were conducted through real estate joint ventures 
during the past years  southwood has participated in four residential joint ventures with john p 
stabile ii  a local developer 
southwood s earnings have from time to time during that period contributed a significant percentage of our consolidated net income 
southwood s contributions from the sale of real estate have increased the fluctuations in our net income during that period 
we expect that southwood will contribute a smaller proportion of our future revenues and earnings

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
events significantly affecting our earnings during recent years overview 
our earnings during the five year period ended december  were significantly affected by the following events that occurred during one or more years of that period o sales of land by southwood  which were especially significant in and  o sale of a cell tower lease in november  o increased recorded amounts of afudc as a result of the ongoing construction of our water treatment plant  o expenses related to the merger agreement that we entered into in april with aqua america inc formerly known as philadelphia suburban corporation and terminated in february  o our actions to oppose ongoing efforts by the city of nashua  new hampshire that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire utility law  and o defense and settlement costs related to parallel investigations by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that were conducted primarily in and settled in december southwood real estate related revenues 
our revenues and earnings were positively affected by sales of southwood land during four of the past five years 
the following table sets forth the amount of revenues that we recognized during each year in the to period attributable to those land sales and the percentage that those revenues represented of our total revenues during each of those years 
of southwood consolidated year land sales revenues s   we expect that southwood s revenues from land sales will constitute a relatively minor percentage of our future consolidated revenues 
terminated merger agreement 
we entered into an agreement in april to be acquired in a merger with aqua america inc in february  before the merger was submitted to our shareholders  we agreed with aqua america to abandon the proposed transaction  because of actions taken by the city of nashua  summarized below  to attempt to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets by eminent domain 
we incurred million and  of merger related expenses that we recognized in and  respectively 
city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 
the city of nashua s mayor stated his opposition to our proposed merger with aqua america almost immediately after we announced it 
in january  nashua residents approved a referendum authorizing the city to pursue the acquisition of our assets by eminent domain or otherwise 
in march  as part of the eminent domain process  the city filed a petition with the new hampshire puc seeking approval to acquire all of our water utility assets  whether or not related to our nashua service area 
the eminent domain proceeding and potential consequences for us are described elsewhere in this form k report 
we have vigorously opposed the efforts of the city to acquire our assets by eminent domain and intend to continue to do so  although we have publicly stated our desire to work with the city toward a fair and equitable solution 
the new hampshire puc commenced a hearing on the merits of the city s petition in january as described elsewhere in this form k report  the hearing has been suspended to allow the city and pennichuck to engage in settlement discussions 
if a settlement cannot be reached  the hearing has been scheduled to resume in june our eminent domain related expenses in  and were million  million  and million respectively 
on january   the company and the city announced that they had entered into an agreement to request at least a day suspension of the eminent domain proceedings  including the ongoing hearings then pending before the new hampshire puc 
the suspension request was unanimously approved by the new hampshire puc 
pennichuck and the city have agreed to suspend the eminent domain proceedings in order to conduct confidential discussions regarding a possible comprehensive settlement that could involve nashua s acquisition of some or all of the assets of pennichuck or one or more of its subsidiaries  or alternatively the shares of pennichuck stock 
pennichuck and the city have also agreed to seek an extension of the suspension of the new hampshire puc proceeding for an additional days or more  subject to new hampshire puc approval  if such an extension may facilitate a comprehensive settlement 
as part of the suspension agreement  the city made a  cash payment to pennichuck 
there can be no assurance  however  that pennichuck and the city will be able to negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement 
sec and new hampshire investigations and settlement 
we and our former president and chief executive officer were the subject of parallel investigations by the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that began in early and late  respectively  as disclosed in previous filings  including the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  effective december   the sec and the bureau entered into settlements with the former president and us 
under the terms of the new hampshire settlement  the company s shareholders as of march  received a payment totaling  as of march  the former president was financially responsible for  of that amount and the company was responsible for the balance 
the company s investigation related expenses were  in   in  and in recent developments pennichuck water rate relief filing

staff also testified that the proposed upgrades to pennichuck water s treatment plant were reasonably necessary and consistent with the public good 
subject to the findings of the new hampshire puc audit staff relative to the actual costs incurred for these upgrades  staff supports a step increase in pennichuck water s rates to recover the cost of these additions effective on or after the date of the commission s final order in this case 
settlement discussions with staff  interveners and pennichuck water are scheduled for march with final hearings on the merits of the case scheduled for april the company anticipates a final order in may proposed pennichuck east rate relief filing

critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
regulatory accounting 
the use of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator such as the new hampshire puc 
in accordance with sfas  we defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the income statement in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallowed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
we did not defer the costs associated with the terminated merger agreement with aqua america  the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding or the sec and bureau regulatory investigations and settlements 
revenue recognition 
the revenues of our water utility subsidiaries are based on authorized rates approved by the new hampshire puc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
we read our residential customer meters generally on a quarterly basis and record revenues based on meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage patterns and the effective water rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
our non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
our pension and other post retirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and post retirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we increased the discount rate effective at december  to from in to reflect increases in long term market interest rates 
in determining pension obligation and expense amounts  this and other assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
further  the value of our pension plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  are subject to fluctuations in market returns which may result in increased or decreased pension expense in future periods 
these conditions impacted the funded status of our pension plan at both december  and  and therefore  will also impact pension expense for our pension plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of although we are not required to make contributions to the plan  we anticipate that we will contribute approximately  to the plan during results of operations general in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our operating activities  as discussed in greater detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  are grouped into three primary business segments as follows o water utility operations  o water management services  and o real estate operations 
our consolidated revenues tend to be significantly affected by weather conditions experienced throughout the year and in past years have been significantly affected by sales of major real estate parcels which occurred from time to time 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for non essential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
results of operations compared to overview 
for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was  compared to net income of  in on a per share basis  basic income per share for was 
as compared to 
per share for the slight improvement in consolidated net income for the year ended december  was attributable to higher amounts of afudc due to increased construction activity  predominantly the upgrade of our water treatment plant  and other income sale of a cell tower lease and a directors and officers insurance settlement payment  partially offset by a decrease in water utility operating income 
our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the increase in the company s combined revenues was primarily attributable to rate relief granted in july and april for pennichuck water  and february for pennichuck east  as well as combined water utility customer growth  partially offset by declines in per capita water consumption attributed primarily to weather patterns 
water utility operations 
our water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield  each of which is regulated by the new hampshire puc 
on a combined basis  net income of our three utilities in calendar year was approximately million  a decrease of from principally due to increases in operating expenses and declines in per capita water consumption the latter attributed primarily to weather patterns  offset in part by customer growth 
our utility operating revenues increased to approximately million in  or almost from for  approximately   and of our total utility operating revenues were generated by pennichuck water  pennichuck east  and pittsfield  respectively  as shown in the following table 
change s pennichuck water   pennichuck east   pittsfield total   the overall increase in water revenues reflects the rate relief granted in july and april for pennichuck water  and february for pennichuck east  as well as a increase in the combined utility customer base during the year  resulting in a total combined customer base of approximately  as of december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in overall billed consumption of compared to one reason for this decrease in consumption was increased rainfall in our core service area  which decreases consumption of water by our customers 
total rainfall during was inches compared to the five year historical average of for the year ended december   utility operating expenses increased by approximately million  or approximately  to approximately million as shown in the table below 
change s operations maintenance    depreciation amortization   taxes other than income taxes   total    the operations and maintenance expenses of our water utility business include such categories as o water supply  treatment  purification and pumping  o transmission and distribution system functions  including repairs and maintenance and meter reading  and o engineering  customer service  and general and administrative functions 
the combined increase in our utilities operating expenses over was chiefly the result of the following o approximately  of increased purification and treatment costs in our core pennichuck water system  reflecting higher purchased water  power  chemical  booster station maintenance  and labor costs  o approximately  of increased transmission and distribution costs relating to repair or replacement of gates  mains  meters and hydrants  supplies  fuel  and labor costs  and o  of increased engineering  customer service and general and administrative costs primarily relating to costs for employee benefits  property and casualty insurance  and administrative salaries 
these increased costs are expected to be embedded in our utilities future cost of providing water service 
as such  our utilities will continue to seek future rate relief to recover these increasing costs 
for calendar year    and of the combined utilities operating income was provided by pennichuck water  pennichuck east  and pittsfield  respectively  compared to   and in water management services 
the following table provides a breakdown of revenues from our non regulated water management services operations for the years ended december  and change s municipal contracts   community system contracts watertight program miscellaneous total   the  increase in contract revenues from municipal contracts primarily resulted from two new contracts commencing in a larger contract for the town of barnstable  massachusetts hyannis water system  and a smaller contract for the town of wilton  new hampshire 
the combined base annual fees under service corporation s municipal contracts with the town of hudson and the town of salisbury represent approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  with the balance of  and  representing fees earned for services performed in addition to the base scope of services for and  respectively

at the end of   customers were enrolled in this program  which was a increase from expenses associated with our contract operations were approximately million and million for and  respectively  comprised primarily of direct costs for servicing our various operating contracts and allocated intercompany charges for general and administrative support for contract operations 
the approximately  or  increase in expenses from to resulted principally from an increase of  in maintenance expenses including the new contracts in hyannis and wilton  and a  increase in allocated intercompany charges is due to a change in the methodology that we used to allocate to service corporation the cost of the resources provided by the company and pennichuck water 
real estate operations 
for the year ended december   southwood s total net revenues were  compared to  in in the table below  we show the major components of southwood s revenues during and s operating revenue sale of timber lease income tower rental other total operating revenues other income loss  net loss income from unconsolidated equity investments other income sale of westwood park llc other income loss  net the decrease in our real estate total net revenues resulted principally from reduced timber sales and losses attributed to the company s share of the hecop entities  partly offset by a gain on the sale of westwood park llc 
at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies  as discussed in greater detail under off balance sheet arrangements and also under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining ownership interest in each joint venture is primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
southwood uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in the joint ventures 
consequently  southwood s investment is adjusted for its share of earnings or losses and for any distributions received from the joint venture 
for the year ended december   southwood s share of pre tax loss from these joint ventures was approximately  compared to pre tax earnings of  for the decline in the joint ventures pre tax earnings resulted primarily from several tenant vacancies in the hecop i and hecop iii buildings 
southwood s share of pre tax earnings loss is included under net earnings loss from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
expenses associated with our real estate operations were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this slight decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and benefits of approximately  and a reduced loss of approximately  in the company s minority interest in westwood park 
this decrease was largely offset by increased intercompany charges 
southwood s operating expenses consisted primarily of  in salaries and benefits   for general and administrative costs  and  in allocated intercompany charges due to additional company resources utilized for the planning and development of our existing land portfolio 
eminent domain related expenses 
our costs incurred for in defending against the city of nashua s eminent domain proceeding were approximately million  essentially unchanged from the costs were primarily attributable to expenses incurred for legal and valuation expert advisory services 
other income 
other income for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively

for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was  compared to net income of million in on a per share basis  basic income per share for was 
as compared to 
per share for the results of operations for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by a significant increase in legal  consulting and other costs relating to the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain efforts 
our eminent domain related expenses  were approximately million in  compared to million in we believe that a presentation of net income excluding these expenses is useful to investors because it is indicative of our financial performance in the ordinary course of business 
we use net income excluding these expenses to evaluate our financial performance because we expect that the financial impact of these expenses has become or  in the relatively near term  will become insignificant 
we expect that the financial impact of expenses related to the eminent domain proceeding will cease within the next two to three years 
the material limitation associated with using this measure is that it does not include all of the expenses required to be included by generally accepted accounting principles 
we compensate for this limitation when using this measure by comparing it directly to net income calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles 
our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the combined revenues of the company s three utilities increased to million  or an increase of from the utilities combined operating income increased to million in  a increase over the increase in the company s combined revenues was primarily attributable to the following o a permanent rate increase approved by the new hampshire puc of implemented by pennichuck water in april for service rendered on and after june   o a temporary rate increase of approved by the new hampshire puc and implemented by pennichuck east in september  and o a increase in the combined utility customer base for the year

we expect our capital expenditures to remain at greater than historical levels during and  as discussed elsewhere in this form k report 
see risk factors and our business 
the following table summarizes our expected capital expenditures and other funds requirements for the to period 
s utility water treatment plant upgrade    utility other plant additions    other total    utility water treatment plant upgrade    utility other plant additions    other total    we have embarked on a major new construction initiative  the upgrade of our water treatment plant that is necessary in order for the plant to meet more stringent  federally mandated safe drinking water standards 
the water treatment plant project construction commenced in the second half of and is expected to be completed by the spring of capital expenditures associated with the water treatment plant upgrade project were approximately million for to and are expected to be million for to in addition to the water treatment plant  we are engaged in continuous construction programs at our utility subsidiaries primarily for water distribution system repair  rehabilitation and replacement  water storage facility maintenance and additions  and more recently  water supply security 
for the period to  capital expenditures for water distribution  storage  and supply totaled million 
for the period to  comparable expenditures are expected to total million 
the amounts shown as other in the table above reflect expenditures for actual or potential acquisitions of small regional regulated water utility systems  consistent with our record of prior acquisitions  expenditures in our non regulated water management services operations  and potential real estate related acquisitions by southwood 
external financing requirements 
due to the significant size of our utility construction program in as described above  we expect that only to of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock 
we expect that the balance of our funding will be obtained through long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
our timing and mix of future debt and equity financing is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to i debt and equity market conditions  ii the need to maintain a balanced capital structure in order to preserve financial flexibility and to manage the overall cost of capital  and iii certain debt issuance covenants as contained in our outstanding loan agreements 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete all or any of the future debt and equity financings described below or to complete them on a timely basis 
the receipt of timely and adequate rate relief will also be critically important in providing us cash flow from operations and the ability to access credit and permanent capital  both debt and equity  at reasonable costs and terms 
we are unable  however  to predict the outcome of our future rate relief filings 
on october   pennichuck water issued an aggregate of  of long term tax exempt bonds through the business finance authority the authority of the state of new hampshire  consisting of three separate series of bonds a through c with coupon rates ranging from to and a maturity date of october  on the date of issuance of the bonds  the authority loaned the proceeds of the series a bonds totaling  to pennichuck water to finance upgrades to its water facilities 
the proceeds of the series b and the series c bonds totaling  and  respectively  were deposited in escrow on the date of issuance which  upon request by pennichuck water on october  and october   respectively or such other dates as pennichuck water may request the proceeds of the series b bonds or the series c bonds  as applicable  will be loaned to pennichuck water to finance the project 
such amounts are held in escrow for the sole benefit of the bondholders with no recourse to us until loaned to pennichuck water and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur capital expenditures for various water facilities projects  primarily the water treatment plant upgrade project  and record the associated debt as a long term liability in and as permitted under the terms of the master agreement  pennichuck water borrowed  as of october    of the proceeds of the series b bonds to finance a portion of the project cost 
this portion of the series b bonds was designated as the series b bonds 
the remaining  of the proceeds of the series b bonds  designated as the series b bonds  were re deposited into an escrow account maintained by the bank of new york trust company  na  as escrow agent  until april   or such later date as pennichuck water may request 
due to current confidential negotiations with the city as well as limitations on incurring additional long term debt under its interest coverage test  pennichuck water expects that it will re escrow the proceeds of the series b bonds on april  to october  as stated elsewhere in this form k report  the company is currently conducting comprehensive settlement discussions with the city of nashua regarding the ongoing eminent domain dispute 
given the need for the substance of those settlement discussions to remain confidential  the highly uncertain outcome of those discussions  and the likelihood that any settlement would provide for a transaction that would trigger an immediate mandatory redemption of outstanding debt  we do not expect to issue or remarket  while such discussions are ongoing  debt securities for which pennichuck water or either of our other utility subsidiaries is liable other than relatively small amounts of srf loans 
furthermore  if a settlement cannot be reached  the new hampshire puc hearing on the merits of the city s eminent domain petition is scheduled to resume in june  and we would not expect the new hampshire puc to rule definitively on the city s petition before the end of the third quarter of given the highly uncertain outcome of such hearing  we may find that we are unable to  or elect not to  issue or remarket such debt securities pending the definitive ruling on the city s petition or that we experience a material increase in the cost that we incur in connection with the issuance or remarketing of such debt 
we believe these risks are particularly relevant to a portion of the long term tax exempt bonds that were issued on our behalf in through the business finance authority of the state of new hampshire 
of the initial million offering  proceeds totaling approximately million have been held in escrow from the date of issuance for the sole benefit of the bondholders 
the associated debt is non recourse to us until the proceeds are loaned to pennichuck water 
upon one or more requests by pennichuck water  some or all of the proceeds of those bonds will be loaned to pennichuck water to finance its water treatment plant upgrade and other certain other capital projects 
when pennichuck water borrows the bond proceeds  the associated bonds will be remarketed to investors who will be relying on pennichuck water as the source of repayment rather than the escrow fund 
if  because of the uncertainties described above relating to the eminent domain dispute  pennichuck water is unable to  or elects not to  remarket the bonds as debt securities for which pennichuck water is liable  it would not be able to borrow any of the bond proceeds then in escrow  and the associated debt would not become pennichuck water s obligation 
under these circumstances  we would expect to rely primarily on our bank revolving credit facility to finance pennichuck water s water treatment plant upgrade and other capital projects 
our borrowing cost under that credit facility would likely be materially higher than tax exempt bond financing costs 
borrowings under the credit facility would also reduce our liquidity to meet other obligations 
in addition to authorizing a tax exempt bond financing  we have applied and will continue to apply for long term debt funds directly from the state of new hampshire under the state s revolving fund program srf 
funds provided under the srf loans carry long term fixed costs at interest rates set with reference to various municipal bond indices  which rates are generally below the rates for comparable us treasury securities of like maturity 
as of december   we had five outstanding srf loans aggregating approximately million 
during we expect total draw downs of an additional million 
also  we have commenced documentation for our sixth srf loan  a proposed million commitment to fund a portion of certain pittsfield capital improvements 
we expect to have a document closing on our sixth srf loan in the second quarter of and to begin draw downs later in significant financial covenants our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  which matures june   contains three financial maintenance tests which must be met on a quarterly basis 
these maintenance tests are as follows our fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed x  our tangible net worth must exceed million  plus new equity issued subsequent to december  and our funded debt less certain cash and short term investment balances  if any must not exceed of our total capitalization 
also  various pennichuck water and pennichuck east loan agreements contain tests that govern the issuance of additional indebtedness 
these issuance tests are as follows to issue short term debt  our total debt must not exceed of our total capital unless the new short term debt is subordinated to existing debt  to issue long term debt  our funded debt must not exceed of our property additions  and to issue long term debt  our earnings available for interest divided by our interest expense must exceed x 
on august   pennichuck water implemented a legal defeasance transaction for its outstanding  new hampshire industrial development authority series tax exempt bonds series bonds 
pennichuck water placed us treasury securities in an irrevocable escrow account with the bank of new york  the bond trustee  in an aggregate amount sufficient to provide for all remaining scheduled principal and interest payments on the series bonds 
this defeasance transaction discharged all future pennichuck water obligations with respect to the series bonds  and pennichuck water will no longer record the debt in its financial statements 
in addition  pennichuck water will no longer be subject to the covenants under the series bonds  one of which restricted pennichuck water from issuing long term debt unless pennichuck water s earnings available for interest divided by its interest expense exceeded 
certain covenants in pennichuck water s and pennichuck east s loan agreements as well as our bank of america revolving credit loan agreement effectively restrict our ability to upstream common dividends from pennichuck water and pennichuck east as well as to pay common dividends to our shareholders 
several of pennichuck water s loan agreements contain a covenant that requires pennichuck water to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
at december   pennichuck water s net worth was million 
one of pennichuck east s loan agreements contains a covenant that requires pennichuck east to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
at december   pennichuck east s net worth was million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants  however our ability to incur additional long term debt under our interest coverage test is currently limited to relatively small amounts of srf loans 
our ability to incur significant additional long term debt and to continue to satisfy these tests depends  among other factors  on receipt of timely and adequate rate relief 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies 
the remaining ownership interest in each of the joint ventures is primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer with whom southwood has also participated in four other residential joint ventures during the past ten years 
the formation of these joint ventures provides southwood with an opportunity to develop its landholdings in such a manner as to provide for a long term income stream through commercial rental activities 
additionally  the joint ventures  as legal entities  mitigate the financial risk associated with sole ownership of developed commercial properties by southwood 
the joint ventures  whose assets and liabilities are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  own certain commercial office buildings on which there are outstanding mortgage notes totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the mortgage notes are each secured by the underlying property 
in addition  southwood is contingently liable on one half of the outstanding balances of two of the three outstanding mortgages  and as such  it has issued a guarantee to the mortgagee for its share of the guaranteed indebtedness 
at december   southwood was contingently liable on approximately million of mortgage indebtedness associated with the limited liability companies 
in addition  if either hecop ii or hecop iii defaults on its indebtedness  southwood s investment in the other hecop will be at risk  because each of hecop ii and iii has guaranteed the indebtedness of the other 
southwood s investments in hecop i iii had an aggregate carrying value of  as of december  distributions from the joint ventures have from time to time during the past ten years been a significant source of funds to support our dividend payments to shareholders 
we account for southwood s investment in the four current joint ventures using the equity method of accounting  meaning that we recognize on a current basis of each joint venture s operating results 
those results reflect ongoing carrying costs such as maintenance and property taxes 
information about our revenues  expenses and cash flows arising from the joint ventures is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has assessed these equity investments in accordance with fin r consolidation of variable interest entities  and has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities 
in june  approximately million of the joint venture mortgage notes mature and are expected to be refinanced 
as disclosed elsewhere in this form k report  substantive negotiations are underway which  if successfully concluded  would substantially increase the occupancy of one office building owned by a joint venture 
if that lease is concluded  we expect that there would be an increase of million in the total amount of the joint ventures mortgage notes 
a substantial portion of the additional borrowing would finance the new tenant s build out 
in october  we completed a tax exempt debt financing with the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
at december  we had borrowed million representing a portion of the million offering conducted in october the remaining million was placed in escrow for the sole benefit of bondholders with no recourse to us and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur capital expenditures for various water facilities projects  primarily the water treatment plant upgrade project  and record the associated debt as a long term liability in and the company has one interest rate financial instrument  an interest rate swap  which qualifies as a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no

pennichuck water has a wholesale water agreement the agreement with manchester nh water works mww to purchase water from mww through six metering points for various community water systems owned by pennichuck water and pennichuck east 
the agreement  amended in february  has a year term and provides for an average daily flow to pennichuck water and pennichuck east of up to million gallons per day mgd with a maximum daily flow rate of mgd 
pennichuck water and pennichuck east purchase water at a rate established by mww for all of its non manchester customers 
the current rate  effective january   is per one hundred cubic feet ccf in areas where fire protection is not provided by mww and per ccf where fire protection is provided 
the agreement requires that pennichuck water and pennichuck east pay a one time source development charge sdc of for each gallon  effective february   of the million gallons of the average daily flow 
to date  pennichuck water and pennichuck east had achieved a combined peak average daily flow of  gallons 
the sdc is re calculated annually to reflect any increases in average daily flow and  if the flow is increased  pennichuck water and pennichuck east pay the sdc for the incremental demand 
any incremental sdc is payable in january of each year 
sdc payments began in and as of december   the total sdc paid to mww was  which allows pennichuck water to draw an average daily flow of up to  the incremental sdc paid in and was  and  respectively 
in january  pennichuck prepurchased an additional  of capacity from mww at the old sdc rate of per gallon 
as of december   the company has no defined commitments for future purchases under this agreement 
del 
in april  pennichuck water entered into a long term lease arrangement with hecop iii  llc for  square feet of office space located in merrimack  new hampshire which serves as our headquarters 
southwood holds a ownership interest in hecop iii  llc and the remaining ownership interests are held by john p 
stabile ii  who is also the holder of ownership interests in three other llc joint ventures with southwood as discussed above 
pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
the accounting for this plan under fasb  employer s accounting for pensions  requires that we use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension expense 
a range of discount rates is established and periodically modified by the internal revenue service to calculate a pension plan s current benefit obligation for purposes of the full funding limits imposed on such plans 
after consultation with the actuary for the pension plan  and based on long term market interest rates  we increased our discount rate from to effective at december  our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed that our long term rate of return on pension plan assets was in and and in in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of in  and these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are updated to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions which may impact the amount of pension expense we recognize 
dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
we offer a dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase program that is available to our shareholders  employees and customers 
under this program  our shareholders may reinvest all or a portion of their common stock dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
we also accept optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at of the prevailing market prices 
this program has provided us with additional common equity of  in and  in environmental matters 
our water utility subsidiaries are subject to the water quality regulations set forth by the epa and the new hampshire department of environmental services des 
the epa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act sdwa 
the quality of our treated water currently meets or is better than all standards set by the epa and the des 
however  increased monitoring and reporting standards have led to additional operating costs for us 
any additional monitoring and testing costs arising from future epa and des mandates should eventually be recovered through water rates in our utilities future rate filings 
pennichuck water s filtration plant in nashua is impacted by the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule rule  which established a new turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
approximately million has been allocated in its budget to continue with the construction of required improvements 
pennichuck water estimates the total cost to comply with this new standard to be approximately million 
the total cost includes all construction and engineering associated costs necessary to complete the required treatment plant upgrades from the project initiation in to its completion in the spring of  although such estimates are subject to any future changes in the rule and changes in design and construction that may be required 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the new hampshire puc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the new hampshire puc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that companies recognize in their financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company has concluded that adoption of fin will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb released sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
the new standard requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s over funded status or a liability for a plan s under funded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income of a business entity  absent sfas consideration 
this statement became effective as of the end of fiscal year ended after december  because we are subject to regulation in the state in which we operate  we are required to maintain our accounts in accordance with the regulatory authority s rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance of sfas no 
based on prior regulatory practice  and in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas  the company will record its under funded pension and post retirement obligations  which otherwise would be recognized as other comprehensive income as of december  under sfas  as a regulatory asset  and expect to recover those costs in our rates charged to customers 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in september  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulleting no 
sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a potential current year misstatement 
prior to sab  companies might evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements using either the income statement or balance sheet approach  with the income statement approach focusing on new misstatements added in the current year  and the balance sheet approach focusing on the cumulative amount of misstatement present in a company s balance sheet 
misstatements that would be material under one approach could be viewed as immaterial under another approach  and not be corrected 
sab now requires that companies view financial statement misstatements as material if they are material according to either the income statement or balance sheet approach 
the company has analyzed sab and determined that compliance with sab had no impact on the reported results of operations or financial condition

our exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our revolving credit facility which contains variable interest rates 
this facility  which includes a total borrowing capacity of million  permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through june  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus based on the results of various financial ratios 
the applicable margin at december  was 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  during we expect to borrow under this facility to fund a portion of our capital improvements program 
we also have a million variable interest rate loan with a bank 
the loan  which was originally scheduled to mature in april  was extended to december  in april  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank that also has a maturity date of december  the purpose of this swap agreement is to mitigate interest rate risks associated with our million floating rate loan 
the agreement provides for the exchange of fixed interest rate payments for floating interest rate payment obligations on notional amounts of principal totaling million 
the floating rate loan with the bank contains interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus based on the results of various financial ratios 
the applicable margin at december  was resulting in an interest rate of 
we designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against the variable future cash flows associated with the interest payments due on the million of notes 
the combined effect of its libor based borrowing formula and the swap produces an all in fixed borrowing cost equal to 
the fair market value of our interest rate swaps represents the estimated unrealized loss to terminate these agreements based upon current interest rates
