item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general as discussed previously  river valley was incorporated for the primary purpose of owning all of the outstanding shares of river valley financial 
as a result  the discussion that follows focuses on river valley financial s financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of december   and river valley s results of operations for periods prior to that date  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
river valley s operations and river valley s actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include  but are not limited to  changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and river valley s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include those with respect to the following matters management s determination as to the amount and adequacy of the loan loss allowance  the effect of changes in interest rates on financial condition and results of operations  and management s opinion as to the effect of recent accounting pronouncements on river valley s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies for the year ended december  certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s assumptions about specific borrowers and current economic and business conditions  among other factors 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation by management includes consideration of past loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the current economic condition  the amount of loans outstanding  certain identified problem loans  and the probability of collecting all amounts due 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolios 
in determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates and assessments 
the company s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative  centralized credit policies  and uniform underwriting criteria for all loans as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic  industry and customer level  regular credit quality reviews and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality 
the company s allowance consists of three components probable losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans  probable losses estimated from historical loss rates  and probable losses resulting from economic or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance 
larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded 
rather  standard credit scoring systems are used to assess credit risks 
reserves are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
loss rates are based on the average net charge off history by loan category 
historical loss rates for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs and nonaccrual loans  changes in mix  credit score migration comparisons  asset quality trends  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the company s internal loan review 
allowances on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge off experience 
the company s primary market area for lending is southeastern indiana and portions of kentucky adjacent to that market 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the company s customers 
the company has not substantively changed any aspect to its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance 
mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the total cost of loans  when sold  is allocated between loans and mortgage servicing rights based on the relative fair values of each 
mortgage servicing rights are subsequently carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
factors included in the calculation of fair value of the mortgage servicing rights include  estimating the present value of future net cash flows  market loan prepayment speeds for similar loans  discount rates  servicing costs  and other economic factors 
servicing rights are amortized over the estimated period of net servicing revenue 
it is likely that these economic factors will change over the life of the mortgage servicing rights  resulting in different valuations of the mortgage servicing rights 
the differing valuations will affect the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheet as well as the amounts recorded in the consolidated income statement 
discussion of changes in financial condition from december  to december  at december   river valley s consolidated assets totaled million  representing an increase of million over the december  total 
this increase in assets was funded by a increase in deposits 
deposits increased by million to a total of million at december  savings and demand deposits increased by million  or  during  while certificates of deposit remained strong with only a slight decrease at million for compared to million for overall  the increases were primarily attributable to the competitiveness of being a community based financial institution versus being a division of a regionally based institution 
liquid assets ie  cash  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits and certificates of deposit decreased by million from december  levels to a total of million at december  investment securities totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  in september of the company formed an investment subsidiary in nevada with the sole purpose of holding liquid investments as interest on these investments is not subject to state taxation 
this resulted in substantial tax savings for the company in loans receivable  including loans held for sale  totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million total at december  there were strong increases in lending for family homes and overall construction lending 
slight decreases were seen in the consumer and non residential loan categories with commercial and multi family lending remaining relatively flat 
the volume of loan sales into the secondary mortgage market decreased during from the volume by million  due in large part to the increase in rates and a decrease in fixed rate lending for family residential properties 
river valley s consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled approximately million for the year ended december   which represented of total loans at that date 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans for the period ended december  non performing loans defined as loans delinquent greater than days and loans on nonaccrual status totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the consolidated allowance for loan losses represented and of non performing loans at december  and  respectively 
non performing loans decreased  at december  compared to december  the company has continued to de emphasize consumer lending because of risk reward opportunities 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   was adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb and other borrowed money increased slightly by million from the total at december  the interest rate environment has changed but we are still getting the advantage of the long term funding we did in shareholders equity totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million total at december  the increase resulted primarily from net income offset by cash dividends and a decrease in unrealized losses on securities available for sale 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general river valley s net income for the year ended december   totaled million  a slight decrease of  or  from net income reported in the decrease in net income in the period was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income offset by a reduction in income tax expense 
the drop in income tax expense was due to a drop in the effective tax rate from in to in  a dollar drop of  primarily resulting from the establishment of the nevada investment subsidiary 
net interest income total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the total  reflecting higher average balances of interest earning assets and higher interest rates 
the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year increased by million  and the yield on those assets increased from an average yield of in to in interest income on loans totaled million for  an increase of approximately million  or  from interest income on investments  fhlb stock and interest earning deposits increased by million  or  due to much higher average balances on those investments and higher rates 
interest expense on deposits increased by million  or  to a total of million for the year ended december   due primarily to higher costs of funding higher average balances 
the cost of deposits increased from in to in fiscal interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
million from as a result of the foregoing changes in interest income and interest expense  net interest income decreased during by  or  compared to the interest rate spread decreased by basis points for  to from in the period  while the net interest margin amounted to in and in provision for losses on loans a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based upon historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by river valley financial  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the primary market area  and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
as a result of such analysis  management recorded a  provision for losses on loans in  a decrease of  or  compared to the  provision recorded in the current period provision generally reflects growth in the loan portfolio  coupled with a change in the loan mix  that is more family residential loans and fewer consumer loans 
non performing loans for the period ended december  were million  a decrease of approximately  from the million recorded as of fiscal year ended net charge offs amounted to  in  compared to  in while management believes that the allowance for losses on loans is adequate at december   based upon available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to cover losses on nonperforming assets in the future 
other income other income amounted to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to  due primarily to a decrease in net gains on loan sales from  in to  in  a decrease of  or 
the volume of loan sales decreased from million in to million in the decline in other income due to the decline in loan sales was offset by an increase in service fees and charges of  resulting from other programs and services 
general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  over the total 
employee compensation and benefits increased slightly by  in fiscal as compared to primarily from additional staffing  cost of living and benefit expense 
mortgage servicing rights expense increased by  in over the same period in in the years prior to  the company recorded impairment on its mortgage servicing rights 
as the market value of the mortgage servicing rights increased during  the previously recorded impairment was recovered thus significantly lowering amortization expense during income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to in september of the company formed an investment subsidiary in nevada with the sole purpose of holding liquid investments as interest on these investments is not subject to state taxation 
as a result  the effective tax rates dropped from in to in comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general river valley s net income for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of  or  from net income reported in the decrease in net income in the period was primarily attributable to an increase of  in administrative and other expenses which were in part offset by an increase in net interest income of  a decrease in the provision for income taxes of  and a decrease in the provision for loan losses of  net interest income total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the total  reflecting higher average balances of interest earning assets and higher interest rates

the cost of deposits increased from in to in fiscal interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase resulted primarily from higher average borrowings year to year  and by a basis point increase in average cost

average balance  yield  rate and volume data the following table presents certain information relating to river valley s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing annual income or expense by the average daily balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the years presented

the net yield on weighted average interest earning assets is calculated by dividing net interest income by weighted average interest earning assets for the period indicated 
rate volume table the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected river valley s interest income and expense during the years indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii total changes in rate and volume 
the combined effects of changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be separately identified  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate year ended december  vs

as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  river valley financial is using the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its capital regulations 
presented on the following table is an analysis of river valley financial s interest rate risk  as of december  and december   as measured by changes in npv for an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift of through basis points in market interest rates 
generally  npv is more sensitive to rising rates than declining rates 
such difference in sensitivity occurs principally because  as rates rise  a bank s assets reprice slower than the deposits that fund them 
as a result  in a rising interest rate environment  the amount of interest a bank would receive on loans would increase as loans are slowly prepaid and new loans at higher rates are made 
moreover  the interest the bank would pay on deposits would increase  but generally slower than the bank s ability to reprice its interest earning assets 
however  river valley financial bank has addressed some of these issues  which has generally reduced its overall exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount of change percent as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount of change percent at december  and at december   the ots did not provide information as to interest rate risk for a point decrease 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  maturities of securities  borrowings and other funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
the company maintains investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of the need for funds  expected deposit flows  the yield available on short term liquid assets and the objectives of the asset liability management program 
the financial regulatory relief and economic efficiency act of  which was signed into law on december   repealed the former statutory requirement that all savings associations maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets in a minimum amount of not less than or more than of their withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings 
the ots adopted a rule that implemented this revised statutory requirement  although savings associations remain subject to the ots regulation that requires them to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure their safe and sound operation 
at december   river valley financial bank had commitments to originate loans totaling million and in addition  had undisbursed loans in process  unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling million 
at such date  river valley financial bank had  in commitments to sell loans and no outstanding commitment to purchase loans 
the company considers river valley financial bank s liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet outstanding short and long term needs 
the company s liquidity  primarily represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a result of the funds provided by or used in the company s operating  investing and financing activities 
these activities are summarized below for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities purchase of securities proceeds from maturities of securities proceeds from sales of securities net loan originations other cash flows from financing activities net increase decrease in deposits net increase in borrowings purchase of stock other net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents river valley financial is required by applicable law and regulation to meet certain minimum capital standards 
such capital standards include a tangible capital requirement  a core capital requirement  or leverage ratio  and a risk based capital requirement 
the tangible capital requirement requires savings associations to maintain tangible capital of not less than of the association s adjusted total assets 
tangible capital is defined in ots regulations as core capital minus intangible assets 
core capital is comprised of common shareholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual associations 
ots regulations require savings associations to maintain core capital generally equal to of the association s total assets except those associations with the highest examination rating and acceptable levels of risk 
ots regulations require that savings associations maintain risk based capital in an amount not less than of risk weighted assets 
risk based capital is defined as core capital plus certain additional items of capital  which in the case of river valley financial includes a general loan loss allowance of million at december  river valley financial exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements at december  the following table summarizes river valley financial s regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital at december  ots requirement actual amount percent of assets amount percent of assets amount amount of excess dollars in thousands tangible capital core capital risk based capital tangible and core capital levels are shown as a percentage of total assets  risk based capital levels are shown as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
the ots has proposed and is expected to adopt a core capital requirement for savings associations comparable to that adopted by the office of the comptroller of the currency for national banks 
the regulation requires core capital of at least of total adjusted assets for savings associations that received the highest supervisory rating for safety and soundness  and to for all other savings associations 
river valley financial is in compliance with this requirement 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require river valley to measure financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars with the exception of investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale  which are carried at fair value 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the rate of inflation  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the rate of inflation 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policies
