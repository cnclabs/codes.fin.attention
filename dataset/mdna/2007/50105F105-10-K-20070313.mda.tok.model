item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion on production and price changes 
we sell several of our products in mature and highly competitive industries and face price pressures in the markets in which we operate  which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
the global markets in which we operate our business are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for our products or make it more difficult for us to compete with our competitors 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities so they could manufacture products that compete with our products 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
higher costs or limited availability of our raw materials may reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity 
the number of sources for and availability of  certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located 
for example  titanium containing feedstocks suitable for use in our tio facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world 
political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability 
if our worldwide vendors were unable to meet their contractual obligations and we were unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we could incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels 
we may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher costs or reduced production levels  which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity 
our leverage may impair our financial condition or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was approximately million  substantially all of which relates to senior secured notes of our wholly owned subsidiary  kronos international  inc our level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders and creditors  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our liabilities  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  requiring that a portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt  which reduces our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  dividends on our common stock  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors 
in addition to our indebtedness  we are party to various lease and other agreements pursuant to which  along with our indebtedness  we are committed to pay approximately million in our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt  and to fund planned capital expenditures  depends on our future ability to generate cash flow 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds under our subsidiaries credit facilities in the future will in some instances depend in part on these subsidiaries ability to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in the applicable credit agreement 
our business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when they become due and to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt in a timely manner on favorable terms  if at all 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flows or to refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations business overview we are a leading global producer and marketer of value added tio tio is used for a variety of manufacturing applications  including plastics  paints  paper and other industrial products 
for  approximately one half of our sales volumes were into european markets 
we believe that we are the second largest producer of tio in europe with an estimated share of european tio sales volumes 
in addition  we estimate that we have a share of north american tio sales volumes 
our production facilities are located throughout europe and north america 
we consider tio to be a quality of life product  with demand affected by gross domestic product and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world 
over the long term  we expect demand for tio to grow by to per year 
this is consistent with our expectations for the long term growth in gross domestic product 
however  demand for tio in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in gdp even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market 
this is due in part to relative changes in the tio inventory levels of our customers 
we believe that our customers inventory levels are partly influenced by their expectation for future changes in the market tio selling prices 
the factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are tio selling prices  foreign currency exchange rates particularly the exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the euro and the canadian dollar  tio sales and production volumes  and manufacturing costs  particularly maintenance and energy related expenses 
our key performance indicators are our tio average selling prices  and our level of tio sales and production volumes 
executive summary we reported net income of million  or per diluted share for  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for and net income of million or per diluted share for net income for rose million from due primarily to the net effect of i the favorable effect of certain net income tax benefits recognized in  partially offset by ii lower income from operations in  iii a gain from the sale of our passive interest in a norwegian smelting operation in and iv a charge in from redemption of our senior secured notes

critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  the recoverability of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ significantly from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
we do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
we maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension and opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
during  we concluded that the more likely than not recognition criteria had been met with respect to the income tax benefit associated with our net operating loss carryforwards in germany 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that we might conclude the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us we record accruals for legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income from operations is impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investments  goodwill and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals 
in addition  other income expense is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals

we estimate the favorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates increased our net sales by approximately million  or less than  compared to the same period in our sales volumes for were a new record for us 
the increase in sales volumes in is primarily due to higher sales volumes in the united states  europe and in export markets  which were somewhat offset by lower sales volumes in canada 
our sales volumes in canada have been impacted by decreased demand for tio

the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for compared to for primarily due to increases in raw material and other operating costs including energy costs 
the negative impact of the increase in other operating costs and raw materials was somewhat offset by the increase in production volumes 
our tio 

production volumes in were also a new record for us for the fifth consecutive year

income from operations income from operations for declined by to million compared to as a percentage of net sales  income from operations declined to for from in the decline in income from operations is driven by the decline in gross margin  which fell to in compared to in while our sales volumes were higher in  our gross margin decreased as we were not able to achieve pricing levels to offset the negative impact of our increased operating costs primarily energy costs and raw materials 
changes in currency rates have also negatively affected our gross margin 
we estimate the negative effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased income from operations by approximately million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at for and for other non operating income expense in we recognized a gain on the sale of our passive interest in a norwegian smelting operation  which had a nominal carrying value for financial reporting purposes  for aggregate consideration of approximately million consisting of cash of million and inventory with a value of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we issued our euro million principal amount of senior secured notes  and used the proceeds to redeem our euro million principal amount of senior secured notes 
as a result of our prepayment of the senior secured notes  we recognized a million pre tax interest charge million net of income tax benefit for the prepayment of the notes  representing the call premium on the notes  the write off of deferred financing costs and write off of the existing unamortized premium on the notes 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
interest expense decreased million from million for to million for due to the redemption of the senior secured notes and the issuance of the senior secured notes during  which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to excluding the effect of currency exchange rates  we expect that interest expense will be lower in as compared to the the annual interest expense on the new notes will be approximately euro million less than on the old notes

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we did not report any interest expense to affiliates in since we repaid our prior million long term note payable to affiliates in interest expense increased million from million in to million in primarily due to the november issuance of an additional euro million principal amount of our prior senior secured notes 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes was million in compared to a benefit of million for see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense for includes an income tax benefit of million for the aggregate effect of favorable developments with respect to income tax audits in belgium and canada  and a charge of million for the unfavorable effect related to the loss of certain of our german income tax attributes 
our income tax benefit for includes a million benefit from the reversal of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance relating to our german operations 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
the majority of our foreign operations sales are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of our sales generated from our foreign operations are denominated in the us dollar 
certain raw materials used worldwide  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income from operations for the periods indicated

increase decrease  in millions impact on net sales income from operations other on september   the chloride process tio facility operated by our owned joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc  temporarily halted production due to hurricane rita 
although storm damage to core processing facilities was not extensive  a variety of factors  including loss of utilities  limited access and availability of employees and raw materials  prevented the resumption of partial operations until october  and full operations until late the majority of lpc s property damage and unabsorbed fixed costs for periods in which normal production levels were not achieved were covered by insurance  and insurance covered our lost profits subject to applicable deductibles resulting from our share of the loss of production at lpc 
both we and lpc filed claims with our insurers 
we recognized a gain of million related to our business interruption claim in the fourth quarter of  which is included in other operating income on our consolidated statement of income 
outlook we expect that our income from operations in will be lower than  due to continued downward pricing pressures and increased energy costs and raw materials costs  offset in part by the effect of higher expected sales and production volumes 
our expectations as to the future of the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond our control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
our efforts to debottleneck our production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
such debottlenecking efforts included  among other things  the addition of finishing capacity in the german chloride process facility and equipment upgrades and enhancements in several locations to allow for reduced downtime for maintenance activities 
our production capacity has increased by approximately over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs  with only moderate capital expenditures 
we believe our annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  with some slight additional capacity expected to be available in through our continued debottlenecking efforts 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities trends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in our earnings 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in this million decrease was due primarily to the net effects of the following items lower income from operations in of million  payment of the million call premium as a result of the may prepayment of our senior secured notes  which is required to be included in cash flows from operating activities  and higher cash paid for income taxes in of million  in part due to the net payment of million in associated with the settlement of prior year income tax audits  offset by lower cash paid for interest in of million  primarily as a result of the may redemption of our senior secured notes which paid interest semiannually in september and december and the april issuance of our senior secured notes which will pay interest semiannually in april and october  and lower net cash used from relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in as compared to  due primarily to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities decreased to million in from million in this million decrease was due primarily to the net effect of the following items higher income from operations in of million  lower net distributions from our tio manufacturing joint venture of million  a higher amount of net cash used to fund changes in inventories  receivables  payables  accruals and accounts with affiliates of million  as discussed below  and higher cash paid for income taxes of million  due primarily to aggregate income tax refunds of million received in changes in working capital are affected by accounts receivable and inventory changes 
our average days sales outstanding dso increased from days at december  to days at december  due to the timing of collection on higher accounts receivable balances at the end of for comparative purposes  our average dso decreased from days at december  to days at december  due to the timing of collections 
our average days sales in inventory dsi increased from days at december  to days at december   as our tio production volumes in the year ended exceeded our tio sales volumes during the period 
for comparative purposes  our average dsi increased to days at december  from days at december  investing activities our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures are primarily for improvements and upgrades to existing facilities 
our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately million million in for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs 
other cash flows from investing activities include million we received in from the sale of our passive interest in a norwegian smelting operation 
financing activities during  we issued euro million principal amount of senior secured notes at of par million when issued  redeemed our euro million principal amount of senior secured notes million when redeemed using the proceeds from the issuance of the notes  made net payments of million under our us credit facility  and borrowed and repaid million under our canadian credit facility 
during  we repaid euro million million when repaid under our european revolving credit facility  borrowed million and repaid million under our us credit facility  and entered into additional capital leases for certain mining equipment in norway for the equivalent of approximately million 
during  we issued an additional euro million principal amount of our prior senior secured notes at of par equivalent to million when issued  and borrowed an aggregate of euro million million when borrowed under our european credit facility  of which we repaid euro million million when repaid 
during  we completely repaid our million of notes payable to affiliates  principally using available cash on hand and the proceeds from the november issuance of euro million principal amount of our prior senior secured notes 
during each of  and  we paid a quarterly dividend to our stockholders of 
per share for an aggregate dividend million in each year 
on february   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share to stockholders of record as of march  to be paid on march  the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary  and the amount  if any  will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability at december   our consolidated debt was comprised of euro million principal amount of our senior secured notes million at december  due in  million under our us revolving credit facility  which matures in september  and approximately million of other indebtedness 
certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with applicable covenants 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined in the agreement of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries  and our ability to service our obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligation or otherwise 
none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although our subsidiary kronos international  inc has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interests of certain of its first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral of the senior secured notes 
at december   our subsidiary  kronos international  inc  had approximately million available for payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined in the indenture for the senior secured notes 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to i fund working capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we will also from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  and use the proceeds to i repay existing indebtedness  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows 
changes in tio pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
in the normal course of our business  we may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the tio 

industry 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   unused credit available under all of our existing credit facilities was approximately million  consisting principally of million under our european credit facility  million under our canadian credit facility and million under our us credit facility 
based upon our expectation for the tio 

industry and anticipated demands on cash resources  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our future obligations including operations  capital expenditures  debt service and current dividend policy 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
capital expenditures we intend to spend approximately million for major improvements and upgrades to our existing facilities during  including approximately million in the area of environmental protection and compliance

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  as amended 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the over or under funded status of each of our individual defined benefit pension plans on our consolidated balance sheets 
this standard does not change the existing recognition and measurement requirements that determine the amount of periodic benefit cost we recognize in net income 
we adopted the asset and liability recognition and disclosure requirements of this standard effective december  on a prospective basis  in which we recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income all of our prior unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs or credits  net of tax  as of december  we recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in  and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
we made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated million in  million in  and million in the discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive advice about appropriate discount rates from our third party actuaries  who may in some cases use their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each measurement date september to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of the measurement date  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligation related to our plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
we use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense 
this is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
we used the following discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in germany norway canada us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to our plans in the germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
we use several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense 
this is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  we consider the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  we receive advice about appropriate long term rates of return from our third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below in germany  the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers  to real estate and other investments   and  respectively 
in norway  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately and to and  respectively 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and the remaining primarily to cash and liquid investments  and  respectively 
in canada  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to other investments  and  respectively 
during  the plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt through december   the average annual rate of return has been approximately with a return for 
at december  the asset mix of the cmrt was in us equity securities  in international equity securities and in cash  fixed income securities and other investments 
at december   the asset mix of the cmrt was in us equity securities  in international equity securities and in cash  fixed income securities and other investments 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation for each plan  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
our assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany norway canada us we currently expect to use the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as we used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
under gaap  we do not recognize all of such actuarial gains and losses in earnings currently  instead these amounts are deferred and amortized into income in the future as part of net periodic defined benefit pension cost 
however  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective december   these amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial gain of million 
this actuarial gain resulted primarily from the general overall increase in the assumed discount rates and the actual return on plan assets in excess of the assumed return 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if we lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during opeb plans certain subsidiaries of ours in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize an asset or liability for the over or under funded status of each of our individual defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans on our consolidated balance sheets 
this standard does not change the existing recognition and measurement requirements that determine the amount of periodic benefit cost we recognize in net income 
we adopted the asset and liability recognition and disclosure requirements of this standard effective december  on a prospective basis  in which we recognized through other comprehensive income all of our prior unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs or credits  net of tax  as of december  we recognized consolidated opeb cost of approximately 
million in  
million in and 
million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  million in and million in substantially all of our accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
as a result  the amount recognized for opeb expense for financial reporting purposes has been  and is expected to continue to be  significantly less than the amount of opeb benefit payments made each year 
accordingly  the amount of accrued opeb expense has declined  and is expected to continue to decline  gradually 
the assumed discount rates we use for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates we use for our us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  we have assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our consolidated opeb expense will approximate 
million in in comparison  we expect to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had raised or lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of our opeb plans as of december   our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately 
million or decreased by 
million at that date  respectively  and our opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than 
million or decrease by less than 
million during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  our accumulated opeb obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by 
million in foreign operations as discussed above  we have substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of our assets and liabilities related to our non us operations  and therefore our consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   we had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and united kingdom pound sterling 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and security prices 
in the past  we have periodically entered into currency forward contracts  interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of our interest rate market risk 
otherwise  we do not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor do we enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than as described below  we were not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of our aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us dollars per euro 
certain norwegian kroner denominated capital leases totaling million in have been excluded from the table below 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated senior secured notes variable rate indebtedness dollar denominated us credit facility at december   euro denominated fixed rate indebtedness  consisting solely of the prior senior secured notes  aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of 
variable rate indebtedness at december   us dollar denominated  was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness at december  the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  at december  million 
certain of our sales generated by our non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
we have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
during and  we have not used hedge accounting for any of our contracts 
at december   we held a series of short term currency forward contracts  which mature at various dates through march   to exchange an aggregate of us million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
these contracts were settled in we held no such currency forward contracts at december  and held no other significant derivative contracts at december  or other we believe there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect our results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for our products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses we would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by us of future events  gains or losses
