for state customers  the americhoice personal care model means increased access to care and improved quality for their beneficiaries  in a measurable system that reduces their administrative burden and lowers their costs 
americhoice considers a variety of factors in determining in which state programs to participate and on what basis  including the state s experience and consistency of support for its medicaid program in terms of service innovation and funding  the population base in the state  the willingness of the physician provider community to participate with the americhoice personal care model  and the presence of community based organizations that can partner with americhoice to meet the needs of its members 
using these criteria  americhoice entered three new markets in  signed an agreement to expand in one existing market in  and is examining several others 
conversely  in recent years  americhoice has exited several markets because of  among other reasons  the lack of consistent direction and support from the sponsoring states

we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors approved investment policy  regulatory limitations  return objectives  tax implications  risk tolerance and maturity dates 
our long term investments are also available for sale to meet short term liquidity and other needs 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non regulated parent companies  typically in the form of dividends  for general corporate use  when and as permitted by applicable regulations 
our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with the issuance of commercial paper  long term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures  to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions  and to repurchase shares of our common stock  depending 
table of contents on market conditions 
in august  we announced that we would not purchase shares under our stock repurchase program until we had completed our restatement which is reflected in this form k and become current in our periodic sec filings 
as a result  we did not repurchase any shares through this publicly announced program for the quarter ended december  cash flows generated from operating activities  our primary source of liquidity  are principally from net earnings  prior to depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenses 
as a result  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
the level of profitability of our risk based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases 
this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses  the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes  which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs 
in  a hypothetical unexpected increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately million 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  debt ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and market conditions 
we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk 
however  a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for the company or limit the company s access to capital 
see cautionary statements relating to our historic stock option practices credit ratings for additional information 
cash and investments cash flows from operating activities were billion in  an increase over billion in the increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of billion in net income prior to depreciation  amortization and other noncash items as well as an increase of approximately billion in cash flows generated from working capital changes 
we generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of billion in and million in the year over year increase primarily resulted from the company receiving twelve monthly medicare premium payments during from cms rather than the eleven monthly payments received in  positively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by million  along with growth in medical payables during compared to primarily driven by overall growth of the insured business 
additionally  there was an increase in accrued taxes payable due largely to an increase in pre tax earnings 
we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position  with cash and investments of billion at december  total cash and investments increased by billion since december   primarily due to strong operating cash flows  cash received from debt and common stock issuances  and cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of  partially offset by common stock repurchases  cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions  many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
at december   approximately billion of our billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
financing and investing activities in addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities  we use commercial paper and long term debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility

in november and december  we issued billion of commercial paper primarily to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the pacificare acquisition described above and to retire a portion of the pacificare debt at the closing of the acquisition  as well as to refinance current maturities of long term debt 
in october  we executed a billion day revolving credit facility to support a billion increase in our commercial paper program in order to finance the cash portion of the pacificare acquisition 
we terminated the day revolving credit facility in march in march  we issued million of fixed rate notes due march we used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes  including repayment of commercial paper  capital expenditures  working capital and share repurchases 
to more closely align interest costs with the floating interest rate received on our cash and cash equivalent balances  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
these interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges 
the interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of billion as of december  with variable rates that are benchmarked to libor  and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the aggregate liability  recorded at fair value  for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately million 
these fair value hedges are accounted for using the short cut method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  whereby the hedges are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value  and the carrying value of the long term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
since these amounts completely offset  we have reported both the swap liability and the debt liability within debt on our consolidated balance sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from to 
our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and long term debt divided by the sum of commercial paper  long term debt and shareholders equity below 
after giving effect to the credit agreement amendments and waivers that we obtained from our lenders  we believe we are in compliance with the requirements of our debt covenants 
on august  we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of our indenture governing our debt securities 
this followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  on or about november   we received a purported notice of acceleration from the holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of our senior unsecured notes due march  as a result of our not filing our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  our indenture requires us to provide to the trustee copies of the reports we are required to file with the sec  such as our quarterly reports  within days of filing such reports with the sec 
on october   we filed an action in the united states district federal court for the district of minnesota seeking a declaratory judgment that we are not in default under the terms of the indenture 
immediately prior to the filing of this form k  we filed our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended june  and september   as well as an amendment to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  should the company ultimately be unsuccessful in this matter  the company may be required to retire all or a portion of the million of senior unsecured notes due march we intend to prosecute the declaratory judgment action vigorously

in conjunction with the pacificare acquisition we committed to make million in charitable contributions to the benefit of california health care consumers  which has been accrued on our consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  we agreed to invest million in california s health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the california marketplace 
the timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion  subject to the advice and oversight of local regulatory authorities  however  our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of the investment commitment remains in place for years after full funding 
we have committed to specific projects totaling million of the million charitable commitment at this time 
due to the financial restatements previously discussed  the company has determined that certain options exercised by nonexecutive officer employees in were discount options subject to section a of the internal revenue code

as such  the company will take a charge  net of tax benefit  of approximately million in the first quarter of currently  we do not have any other material contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products  programs and technology applications  and may include acquisitions 
medicare part d pharmacy benefits contract beginning january   the company began serving as a plan sponsor offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance coverage under a contract with cms 
the company contracts with cms on an annual basis 
under medicare part d  members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium  typically with an initial annual deductible  coinsurance of for the member and for the company up to an initial coverage limit of  of annual drug costs  no insurance coverage between  and  except the member gets the benefit of the company s significant drug discounts  and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of  covered approximately by cms  by the company and by the member up to an annual out of pocket maximum of  the company s contract with cms includes risk sharing provisions  wherein cms retains approximately to of the losses or profits outside a pre defined risk corridor 
the risk sharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the company in its initial contract application 

table of contents during  members were permitted to enroll or disenroll in a medicare part d plan until may  once enrolled  most members were allowed to switch plans once before may  although low income members eligible for both medicare and medicaid are allowed to change plans monthly 
contracts are generally non cancelable by enrollees after may  after that date  enrollees may change plans once every year between november and december to take effect january of the following year 
as a result of the medicare part d benefit design  the company incurs benefit costs unevenly during the annual contract year 
while the company is responsible for a majority of a medicare member s drug costs up to  the member is responsible for their drug costs from  up to  at the company s discounted purchase price 
as such  the company incurs disproportionately higher benefit claims in the first half of the contract year as compared with last half of the contract year  when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the  initial coverage limit 
although the company also incurs costs for individuals with annual pharmacy claims in excess of  these costs represent a much smaller portion of total contract costs  and will be incurred primarily in the second half of the year 
the uneven timing of medicare part d pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of year that entitle the company to risk share adjustment payments from cms 
accordingly  during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net risk share receivable from cms in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in premium revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
this represents the estimated amount payable by cms to the company under the risk share contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period 
those losses reverse in the second half of the year and final risk share amounts due to or from cms  if any  are settled approximately six months after the contract year end 
the projected net risk share payable to be paid to cms as of december  was approximately million 
aarp in january  we entered into a ten year contract with aarp to provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp 
these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance  health insurance focused on persons between to years of age  and other products 
under the terms of this medicare supplement insurance contract  we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk 
we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program 
premium revenues from these aarp supplemental health insurance offerings were approximately billion in  billion in and billion in the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp medicare supplement insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf 
the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue  medical costs  investment income  administrative expenses  member services expenses  marketing expenses and premium taxes 
underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders  unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the rsf 
to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf  we would have to fund the deficit 
any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract 
to date  we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the rsf balance at december  is currently sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks associated with the contract 
under a separate license agreement with aarp  we sell medicare prescription drug benefit plans under the aarp brand name 
we assume all operational and underwriting risks and losses for these plans 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions we conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
these standards  among other things  require 
table of contents these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require 
in  based on statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels  the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was approximately billion 
for the year ended december   the company s regulated subsidiaries paid over billion in dividends to their parent companies  including approximately million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators 
the inability of the company s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies would impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures  business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
in addition  the inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt  however  our cash flows from operating activities generated from our non regulated businesses greatly mitigate this risk 
as of december   approximately billion of our billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have either not yet received or processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  care provider contract rate changes  medical care consumption and other medical cost trends 
depending on the health care provider and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can range from two to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact  we adjust the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
historically  the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than of annual medical costs  less than of annual earnings from operations and less than of medical costs payable 

table of contents in developing our medical costs payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the company as of the date of estimation 
for months prior to the most recent three months  we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
we do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors 
accordingly  for the most recent three months  we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available  supplemented by a review of near term completion factors 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including  but not limited to  pharmacy utilization trends  inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control 
we also consider completion factors in developing medical cost estimates for the most recent months 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factor increase decrease in factor increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months

table of contents the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on the company s historical experience in estimating its liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 
in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period  one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period 
the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations in millions 
favorable development increase decrease to medical costs a medical costs earnings from operations as restated b as adjusted c as restated b as adjusted d  d  d a the amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year 
b restated to include the impact of fas r  which we adopted effective january   as well as impacts associated with the restatement described in note restatement of consolidated financial statements 
c represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development 
d not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in will change as our december  medical costs payable estimate develops throughout our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of the company s liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company s liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
the increase in favorable medical cost development in was driven primarily by growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of as our medical costs payable estimate increases in amount due to increases in the fully insured consumer base and inflationary increases in medical costs  the absolute dollar amount of subsequent changes to that estimate will increase even if the accuracy of our medical costs payable estimate remains consistent as a percentage of the original estimate 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable  excluding the aarp business  earnings from operations would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by per share 
historic stock option measurement dates the selection by the company of the methodologies described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements to determine the measurement dates of historic stock option grants involved judgment and careful evaluation of all relevant facts and circumstances for each historical grant 
the company believes it has used the most appropriate methodologies 
however  the company also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustments would have changed under two alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates 
the following table sets forth the incremental effect on earnings before income taxes that would result from using the alternate measurement date determination methodologies described below communication date 
this methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which stock option grants were communicated to employees  assuming that the communication date is readily 
table of contents identifiable 
this was generally the date on which stock option awards became viewable by all optionees on the company s intranet portal for employee benefits 
in the event the communication date was not readily available  with respect to section officers  this alternative methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which a section officer filed a form or other statement of changes in beneficial ownership with respect to a specific grant and  for employees who are not section officers  the date on which the company has determined that the ceo certificate was likely executed by the former ceo of the company 
legal execution date 
this methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which the company has determined that the legal documentation approving a grant was likely executed  based on evaluation of all available information 
for section officers  this date is typically the date on which the company has determined that the written action of the compensation committee was likely executed by a majority of the members of the compensation committee and  for all other employees  this date is typically the date on which the company has determined that the ceo certificate was likely executed by the former ceo of the company

we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets as of december   we had long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets  property  equipment and capitalized software  of billion 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability  we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows  which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
investments as of december   we had approximately billion of investments  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary  based on analysis of relevant factors  we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
we analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage  if any  for such matters 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
see cautionary statements for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation 
inflation the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers 
through contracts with physicians and other health care providers  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices 
the company s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt 
approximately billion of our cash equivalents and investments at december  were debt securities 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately million 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  approximately billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately billion had fixed rates as of december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt 
at december   we had million of equity investments  a portion of which were held by our unitedhealth capital business in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies 
market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio

cautionary statements relating to our business we must effectively manage our health care costs 
under our risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products comprise approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we generally use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences 
we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  however  medical cost inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for unitedhealthcare s commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding 
if these 
table of contents estimates prove too high or too low  the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results 
that change can be either positive or negative to our results 
we face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate 
for our uniprise and health care services segments  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente and wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit organizations and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross and blue shield association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas 
our specialized care services and ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier or provider arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
our relationship with aarp is important 
under a ten year contract with aarp  which commenced in  we provide medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance  health insurance focused on those ages to and other products to aarp members 
as of december   this supplemental health insurance program represented approximately billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately million aarp members 
we also have a separate license agreement with aarp to brand certain of our medicare part d prescription drug plans 
the aarp contracts may be terminated by us or aarp at the end of their respective initial terms and may also be terminated early under certain circumstances  including a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangements depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
some of the effects of changes in medicare remain uncertain 
the changes in medicare as a result of the medicare modernization act of mma and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are complex and wide ranging and continue to affect our businesses 
we have taken advantage of new opportunities created by the mma to partner with the federal government  including medicare part d prescription drug coverage  medicare advantage regional ppos  private fee for service plans and special needs plans for chronically ill medicare beneficiaries 
we have invested considerable resources in creating new medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the mma 
legislative or regulatory changes to these programs could have a significant impact on us 
additionally  our ability to successfully participate in the medicare part d program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us  cms and state governments 
the inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government  the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business 
additionally  our participation in the medicare part d program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  pharmaceutical costs and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare part d program or otherwise  our results could be materially affected 
any positive or negative developments for the medicare part d program as a whole are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our medicare part d program 

table of contents we are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in medicare and medicaid programs 
we participate as a payer in medicare advantage  medicare part d  and medicaid programs and receive revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments 
funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities 
an unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our business is subject to routine government scrutiny  and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions  including integration of acquisitions 
delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past  and may do so in the future 
state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures  claim payments and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information  medical malpractice litigation  and government sponsored programs 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law  or  if enacted  what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability  require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
we typically are involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these may include routine  regular and special investigations  examinations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the us department of justice and us attorneys 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business  loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price  damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 
relationships with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially 
table of contents dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices 
in any particular market  these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical arrangement  the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider 
to the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
the nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
these matters include  among others  claims related to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by provider groups 
see legal matters for a more detailed description of our pending litigation matters 
the company is largely self insured with regard to litigation risks  however  we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims 
although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters 
although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate  it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 
our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products 
in connection with the pacificare merger  we acquired a pbm business  prescription solutions 
we also provide pharmacy benefits management services through unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions 
prescription solutions and unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions are subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
in addition  federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies 
while we do not believe that the pbm is a fiduciary  if a court were to determine that our pbm business acts as a fiduciary under erisa  we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies  preferred drug listings and drug management programs  contracting network practices  specialty drug distribution and other transactions 
our pbm also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy  which subjects it to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 
we also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy 

table of contents our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  to provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of technology initiatives  changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions  we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care providers  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
in addition  failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 
due largely to our recent acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   representing approximately of our total assets 
if we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
our knowledge and information related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 
we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with these proposals  requirements  and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases
