growth through acquisitions was critical to the full valu specialty segment in as both the roanoke and insulating glass business acquisitions  discussed below  were part of the full valu specialty segment 
resources from within the full valu specialty segment were allocated in to both the due diligence and integration of the two acquisitions as over million was invested for the two businesses combined 
total company when reviewing the company s financial statements  it s important to understand how certain external factors impact the company 
these factors include changes in the prices of commodities  such as crude oil and natural gas global supply and demand of raw materials economic growth rates  especially in the united states and europe  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar the company purchases thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of its cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  the company s financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from commodity prices  supply and demand issues of raw materials also have a significant impact on the company s costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  as they did in  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as the hurricanes in the us in  also can have an impact as key raw material producers were shut down for extended periods of time 
the company s centralized global sourcing group continually monitors areas such as capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect its raw materials 

table of contents in the company generated percent of its revenue in the us and percent in europe 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which the company supplies products 
for example in the global adhesives segment  revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and automotive tend to fluctuate with the economic activity 
in the full valu specialty segment revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity in the us the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  the company s revenues and costs become higher as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar has the most significant impact as compared to all other currencies 
the impact of currency fluctuations on net revenue for the total year of was minimal as decreases in the first half of the year were offset by increases in the second half 
during  the company continued with its strategy that began in to reposition its product lines to focus on more value added solutions for the customers 
the repositioning strategy relates primarily to the global adhesives segment 
this has required the company to turn away certain low margin business that is based primarily on selling price 
this strategy was the main reason for the gross profit margin to increase from percent in to percent in there were several events transactions that occurred in that had significant effects on the financial results  including the following all of these are discussed in more detail in other areas of this report the acquisition in the second quarter of the roanoke companies group roanoke for approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
the acquisition of the insulating glass sealant business of henkel kgaa in germany in the third quarter for approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
effective december   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payments sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore has not restated prior periods results 
all share based compensation expense is recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
total share based compensation expense recorded in was million million  net of tax  of which million related to modifications to the former ceo s share based awards

see notes  and of the consolidated financial statements for more details 
lee mitau  who has been a member of the company s board of directors since replaced mr 
stroucken as chairman 
the new ceo is michele volpi who was the group president of the global adhesives operating segment since the sale of the company s powder coatings business component on december  to valspar corporation for approximately million 
over the past several years the company s focus in the 
table of contents full valu specialty operating segment has become more centered on the construction and packaging industries 
the powder coatings unit no longer fit the strategic direction of the segment 
the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of million million  net of tax in the fourth quarter of the financial statements for all periods presented in this report reflect the results of the powder coatings business  including the gain on the sale  as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statement for more details 
the company s financial results for were strong 
income from continuing operations of million was percent above the income from continuing operations of million 
the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from per share in to per share in  an increase of percent 
several reasons for the improved profitability are discussed below in results of operations  but some of the most significant were the management of selling price increases in an environment of rising raw material costs  the product line repositioning strategy and improved cost structures through the utilization of the lean six sigma sm methodology 
benefits realized in from lean six sigma sm related initiatives were estimated at million  an estimated increase of nearly million as compared to lean six sigma sm methodology combines two powerful business improvement models lean  which focuses on the elimination of waste and six sigma  which is a customer driven methodology focused on reducing variation in business processes 
projects and initiatives are run by individuals trained in project management disciplines that enable cross functional teams of associates to make fact based decisions and implement solutions on a companywide basis 
free cash flow  defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  less cash outlays for capital expenditures and dividends  was million in  million in and million in and was calculated as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations purchased property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow the improvement in free cash flow in resulted primarily from the increased profitability as well as the continuing focus on working capital management 
management believes that free cash flow is more useful to shareholders as an indicator of cash flow generation than cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  because it provides more insight into the company s ability to fund such things as debt reduction and acquisitions 
the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to november once in every five or six years  the fiscal year is weeks instead of fiscal was a week year 
in reviewing the financial results as compared to  the estimated impact of one less week in resulted in a decrease in net revenue of million or percent and a decrease in net income of approximately million or per share 
outlook as the company enters into  the raw material environment continues to be uncertain 
as previously mentioned  throughout and  the company experienced a significant and continued increase in raw material costs 
record energy prices  tight supply  and natural disasters combined to result in significant cost inflation 
as the company looks forward to  the company does not yet see a dramatic change in raw material costs 

table of contents for example  the recent declines in ethylene have not yet fully translated into basic adhesives raw materials declines due to inventories  specific supply issues and intermediate derivatives pricing power 
the company does  however  expect some minor cost reductions for certain ethylene based raw materials in the early part of  but continues to face pressures in waxes  tackifying resins  and refined oils 
ethylene derivatives  such as eva  vam  and vae  whose costs tend to move with these materials  account for to percent of the company s total raw material purchases 
however  the company spends approximately twice as much on materials such as tackifying resins  waxes  oils  and solvents where ethylene and propylene developments have no effect on their costs 
in addition  over percent of the materials that are influenced by ethylene and propylene are purchased abroad where the cost development trends for ethylene and propylene are not favoring purchasers of the derivatives of these materials 
while the raw material panorama is uncertain and not easy to analyze given the thousands of raw materials that the company buys  the company intends to remain vigilant to take advantage of any potential raw material cost decreases 
managing selling prices in this uncertain raw material environment will continue to be a critical factor in the financial results 
the company has experienced declines in sales volume in both and much of this volume decline was expected as management s strategy has been to focus on the product applications that provide the most value to both the customer and the company 
execution of the strategy has required the company to walk away from certain low profit volume 
with manufacturing activity in north america showing signs of contracting as we move into  sales volume growth will continue to be a challenge for the company in recent figures on housing starts and auto sales from the us automakers are two areas in particular that are in decline 
management believes the right long term strategy is in place and therefore  is cautiously optimistic for organic sales growth in the positive effects on the company s cost structures from utilizing lean six sigma sm are expected to continue in benefits will be realized in both the manufacturing operations and the sg a expense areas 
the ongoing focus on strict cost control will also continue in pension expenses are expected to be lower in as compared to by to million dollars on a global basis 
the primary reason for the expected decrease in pension expenses is the increase in discount rates used to calculate pension obligations 
higher discount rates result in lower pension obligations and in turn  lower pension expense 
the company s balance sheet as of december  was strong with over million in cash and cash equivalents 
subsequent to fiscal year end the company paid down million of debt  which will lower interest expense from the run rate 
the strong balance sheet positions the company with borrowing capacity to support a significant level of merger and acquisition activity 
management continuously evaluates potential opportunities 
in  the company will have the option to purchase an additional percent ownership position in the joint venture company in japan for million 
sekisui chemical corporation will also have the option to purchase an additional percent ownership position in the company s china entities for million 
both sekisui chemical corporation and the company are evaluating these potential options  but neither party has committed to exercising their respective option 
the company s new ceo  michele volpi  assumed his role on december  mr 
volpi has been an integral part of the financial improvement made by the company over the last two years in his role as the global adhesives group president 
as with any leadership change  new ideas and initiatives are to be expected 
the company has established an excellent financial foundation over the past two years 
this allows mr 
volpi to fully assess the organization before determining if any new initiatives are necessary and if so  when they should be implemented 
no new initiatives have been announced as of the date of this filing 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill recoverability  long lived assets recoverability  conditional asset retirement obligation assumptions  share based compensation accounting  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and healthcare cost trend rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate in the us was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pretax 
discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the current investment mix in the us portfolios is primarily in us equities 
the company has used an expected return on assets assumption for the us portfolio of percent since this rate was used in calculating the expenses for  and for  the company will use a rate of percent due to the reallocation of the portfolio assets to include a component of fixed income securities 
a change of percentage points for the expected return assumption will impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for and percent in the prior three years 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
as of december   the company s balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill 
the goodwill is primarily included in the full valu specialty operating segment 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill to the net asset carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
the calculations confirmed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the net asset carrying values for all reporting units 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
the calculation uses a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to project financial performance and related cash flows 

table of contents the projections are based on management s best estimate given recent financial performance  market trends  strategic plans and other available information 
future results will most likely differ from the projected results 
however  based on the margin that fair value exceeded the net asset carrying value of the various reporting units  management does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial results from differences in these assumptions 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  discount  currency exchange  and tax rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
conditional asset retirement obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 conditional asset retirement obligations fin  the company has recognized conditional asset retirement obligations related to special handling of asbestos related materials in certain facilities 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company has identified certain facilities for which it has plans or expectations of plans to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos or has plans or expectation of plans to exit a facility 
once the probability of an action is determined  the company applies certain assumptions to determine the related liability and asset 
these assumptions include the use of inflation rates  the use of credit adjusted risk free discount rates and the reliance on third party asbestos abatement specialists to estimate the costs to handle asbestos related materials 
the recorded liability is required to be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and or revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate 
share based compensation the company has granted stock options  restricted stock and deferred compensation awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
the company recognizes compensation expense for all share based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  the company recognizes share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognizes compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
prior to sfas r adoption  the company accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly  only recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards  which had a grant date intrinsic value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the company uses the black scholes model to value its stock option awards 
management believes that future volatility will not materially differ from its historical volatility 
thus  the 
table of contents company uses the historical volatility of the company s common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and management uses different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted  as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
the company has recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its sorocaba  brazil facility 
in the eifs litigation involving primarily single family homes  million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries were accrued 
the company also has accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
a complete discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments could negatively impact the company s results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at december   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
results of operations compared to and net revenue in millions vs vs net revenue 
table of contents net revenue in of  million increased million or percent from the net revenue of  million 
the net revenue was million or percent above the net revenue of  million in management reviews variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  acquisitions divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years decrease vs vs product pricing sales volume acquisitions divestitures currency total the impact on net revenue of having one less week in as compared to accounted for a net revenue decrease of approximately percentage points and it was primarily related to volume 
in comparing to  the extra week in contributed an increase in net revenue of approximately percent 
the increase in selling prices and the decrease in sales volume is consistent with the company s continuing strategy to reposition its product lines to focus on areas that have the highest value to the customer and likewise generate the highest returns 
the global adhesives and full valu specialty segments had significant increases in net revenue due to increases in average selling prices in both and as compared to the respective prior year 
the net revenue increase of percent in resulting from acquisitions divestitures was primarily due to the two significant acquisitions made during the year in the full valu specialty segment 
cost of sales in millions vs vs cost of sales percent of net revenue the reduction in cost of sales in as compared to was due primarily to the percent reduction in sales volume  which resulted in reduced raw material usage and lower labor costs in the manufacturing facilities 
improved productivity also had a positive impact on the cost of sales 
these decreases were offset by the significant increase in raw material costs and also the cost of sales related to the acquisitions made during the acquisitions accounted for over million of cost of sales in throughout and  the company experienced a significant and continued increase in raw material costs  which caused raw material prices to increase approximately percent during record energy prices  tight supply  and natural disasters combined to create significant cost inflation 
the company reacted with the implementation of disciplined pricing processes  which are built to last  and demonstrated the ability to work with customers to recuperate sudden higher costs the company considers pricing and inventory levels of crude oil  natural gas  ethylene and propylene to be key indicators in managing its raw materials strategy 
in addition to these indicators the company also considers general indicators such as gdp growth  consumer spending  general manufacturing activity and housing starts to help indicate the general health of the economic environment 
as of december   the company believes that the general indicators are suggesting slower future growth than in the past  without a significant threat of recession 
should economic conditions begin to slow  the company s global sourcing organization will proactively re negotiate affected raw material supply arrangements to improve its cost position 
in addition to the pricing actions mentioned above  the company increased its global strategic sourcing team process initiatives such as multi sourcing  raw material arbitrage  contract re negotiation and alternative 
table of contents technology leverage in to offset the inflationary impact by approximately million dollars in similarly these types of initiatives offset between and million dollars of inflationary impact in and raw material cost increases were the predominant reason for the cost of sales increase in as compared to energy prices increased throughout the year in response to higher demand combined with interruptions in supply 
supply interruptions were exacerbated by the hurricanes in the united states in august and september of the increases in raw materials were partially mitigated by reduced costs and improved efficiencies resulting from the company s lean six sigma sm initiatives and overall cost controls in the manufacturing areas 
gross profit margin in millions vs vs gross profit percent of net revenue the gross profit margin was percent in as compared to percent in both and the improved margin in was attributed primarily to the company s strategy of repositioning its product lines to more value added applications 
a key component of this strategy is rigorous management of the company s selling prices 
the percent increase in net revenue in related to increases in selling prices reflects the success of the selling price management 
in the gross profit margin was flat with as selling price increases were required to offset the impact of rapidly rising raw material costs

operating segment results compared to and the company is managed through two operating segments global adhesives and full valu specialty 
resources are allocated and financial performance is assessed at the total operating segment level 
this section contains the business component detail for each operating segment including the net revenue and operating income variances at the total operating segment level 
the two segments are organized based on different business models 
the global adhesives segment has a business to business model with the adhesive as an ingredient used in the customer s end product 
the global adhesives segment has common business processes and is thus organized geographically to effectively and efficiently execute the global strategies of the segment 
the full valu specialty segment has predominately a business to consumer business model  which supplies finished product eg ceramic tile installation products  flooring adhesives  paint 
components with this type of model are considered specialty businesses 
in the situations where the model is business to business for full valu specialty  then the model is solution driven eg insulating glass and packaging solutions 
business components with a solution driven model are considered full valu businesses 
the different models result in different channels  customers  decision makers  and products for the two segments 
the two operating segments are evident from the company s internal management and organizational structure 
each operating segment is managed by a group president  which reports directly to the chief executive officer 
the group presidents are held accountable for  and are compensated based upon  the performance of the entire segment managed by the group president 
the business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the overall segment rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment 
individual component results are subject to numerous allocations of segment wide costs that may or may not have been focused on that particular component for a particular reporting period 
the costs for these allocated resources are not tracked on a where used basis as financial performance is assessed at the total operating segment level 
therefore  the financial information for the components should only be used for directional indications of performance 

table of contents management evaluates the performance of each of the company s operating segments based on operating income  which is defined as gross profit less sg a expenses 
corporate expenses are fully allocated to each operating segment  except that  in the fourth quarter of  million of charges related to a separation agreement with the company s chief executive officer were not allocated between the segments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
over percent of the company s raw material supply arrangements are managed and executed through the corporate global sourcing group 
when a raw material is common between the two segments  a single supply arrangement may be established to source the material to both segments 
however  since many of the raw materials are unique to each segment  supply arrangements are generally managed for the individual segment 
within a segment  supply arrangements tend to be negotiated and managed centrally  on a regional basis  with some supply arrangements covering multiple regions 
the corporate treasury department centrally manages all global exposure to foreign currencies 
the treasury personnel review the non functional currency balance sheet positions for all entities on a monthly basis 
to the extent the non functional currency assets and liabilities are not in balance  forward currency contracts are put in place that closely match the duration of the underlying net balance sheet positions 
typically  these contracts are for  or days

table of contents total global adhesives the global adhesives segment is organized  managed and reported on a geographic basis 
the product categories see page of the overview to this md a of assembly  converting and nonwoven are sold throughout the four geographic regions 
the footwear category is sold primarily in the asia pacific region 
the automotive business in north america is treated as a separate component due to the nature of the joint venture structure through which this component is managed 
the product repositioning initiative that is referred to several times in the following discussion is a full analysis of the segment s product offerings and includes actions such as  setting profitability thresholds for new business  exiting unprofitable volume  focusing on higher margin higher value applications  investing in the most profitable and growing market segments and compensating sales personnel on profitability versus volume 
the implementation of the lean six sigma sm methodology  as described on page in the overview section of this md a has been a phased approach in global adhesives 
the rollout began in and the north america region was the first to fully realize benefits from these projects in the benefits continued throughout in north america 
in europe  projects were started in with full benefits realized in and in latin america  the methodology was started early in the asia pacific region is just beginning to adopt and implement the lean six sigma sm concepts 
a key goal of the lean six sigma sm initiative is to focus percent of the projects on customer related activities and percent on increasing productivity and improving processes 
lean six sigma sm tools have been used extensively in the company s product repositioning efforts 
product pricing accounted for percent of global adhesives net revenue increase in as compared to sales volumes declined due to the continued repositioning of product lines to focus on more value added solutions for customers 
one less week in versus had a negative impact of approximately percent on net revenue 
the reduction in net revenue related to divestitures was mainly driven by the deconsolidation of the company s japanese adhesive entity 
operating income for the global adhesives segment increased percent as compared to repositioning product lines to focus on more value added solutions combined with cost savings generated by successful lean six sigma sm projects and lower production volumes were the main drivers of the improvement in operating income 
continued focus in these areas in north america and europe combined with greater emphasis in the remaining components generated the acceleration of operating income growth in compared to net revenue for the global adhesives segment increased percent in compared to product pricing represented a percent increase 
sales volume declined slightly as a result of the decision in early to reposition product lines to more value added solutions for customers 
the lower volume was partially offset by an extra week in versus that accounted for a net revenue increase of approximately percent 
operating income for the global adhesives segment increased percent as compared to this increase was primarily the result of repositioning product lines to focus on more value added solutions and cost savings realized from successful lean six sigma sm projects primarily in north america and europe 
north america the north america component  which is the largest component of the global adhesives segment  experienced a net revenue decrease in of percent 
product pricing increased net revenue percent in as compared to sales volume declined due to the continued repositioning of product lines to focus on more value added solutions for customers and the impact of having one less week in operating income for the north america component increased percent as compared to continued efforts to reposition products and lower operating costs by successfully completing lean six sigma sm projects were the primary drivers of this improvement 
profit margins tend to be higher in the north american component of global adhesives as compared to other components of global adhesives partially due to economies of scale realized in the cost structure of having only two countries ie ie and canada as opposed to many countries in each of the other geographic regions 
the net revenue increase of percent was favorably impacted by a percent increase in product pricing in as compared to the decline in sales volume due to the repositioning of product lines to focus on more value added solutions for customers was partially offset by the extra week in operating 
table of contents income increased percent in as compared to the efforts initiated in early to focus on more value added solutions and the continued success of cost reduction efforts related to lean six sigma sm projects were the primary drivers in generating the increase in operating income 
europe the europe component achieved a percent net revenue increase in as compared to product pricing represented a percent increase 
sales volume declined slightly due to its efforts to reposition its product lines to focus on more value added solutions for customers and the impact of having one less week in currency had a negative percent impact on net revenue as compared to as weakness in the euro in the first half of the year was partially offset by a strengthening in the latter part of operating income for the europe component increased percent as compared to continued efforts to reposition products and the impact of successful lean six sigma sm projects to reduce operating costs in both and were the principal drivers of the increase in operating income 
in the europe component achieved a percent increase in net revenue 
product pricing represented a percent increase in net revenue as compared to the february acquisition of probos in portugal accounted for all of the acquisition net revenue increase 
in addition  the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar generated a percent improvement in net revenue 
the strong focus and success of lean six sigma sm projects initiated in early and actions to reposition products in the second half of were the primary factors that enabled the europe component to increase operating income by million in as compared to latin america the latin america component increased revenue percent as compared to the increase was driven by a percent increase in product pricing as a result of repositioning products to focus on more value added solutions 
sales volume declined slightly due to having one less week in continued efforts to reposition its product lines and the completion of lean six sigma sm projects in early to successfully reduce operating costs enabled the latin america component to increase operating income million as compared to the latin america component achieved a percent increase in net revenue in as compared to a strong focus on product pricing generated an increase of percent in sales volume declined slightly due to the focus on product pricing partially offset by the extra week in the latin america component improved its operating income by million in primarily due to the strong focus on product pricing 
the latin america component does not reflect an impact from currency exchange because the functional currency for all subsidiaries in this region is the us dollar 
asia pacific the percent reduction in net revenue was driven primarily by the deconsolidation in of the company s japanese adhesive entity 
the entity was contributed to the sekisui fuller joint venture and therefore was no longer consolidated by the company 
product pricing generated a percent increase in net revenue in as compared to sales volume declined due to the repositioning of product lines to focus on more value added solutions for customers and the impact of having one less week in operating income for the asia pacific component increased by million in as compared to product repositioning and the continuation of cost management activities were the primary factors in achieving this increase in operating income 
the contribution of the japanese adhesive entity was the principle cause of the percent decrease in net revenue as included approximately four months of revenue from japan while included a full year of revenue from the japanese entity 
the reduction in net revenue related to the deconsolidation was partially offset by increased sales volume  the impact of the extra week in and generally favorable currency impacts 
operating income declined million primarily due to the deconsolidation partially offset by increased volume  lower costs and favorable currency 
although the company no longer recognizes operating income from the deconsolidated japanese adhesive entity  it began to recognize the earnings on its investment in the sekisui fuller joint venture in equity in earnings related to this joint venture was million and million in and  respectively

therefore  the above financial information should only be used for directional indications of performance 
total full valu specialty the full valu specialty segment is managed on a product line basis as opposed to the geographic structure of global adhesives 
the specialty type components of the segment operate primarily with a business to consumer business model in which finished products are offered to end users mainly through wholesale or retail distribution channels 
the specialty components are specialty construction  paints and consumer 
the full valu components insulating glass and packaging solutions offer more business to business solutions 
in addition to selling products  these components offer consulting services for such things as how to engineer a particular product application 
the full valu components tend to operate at a higher profit margin than the specialty components 
the overall full valu specialty operating segment is managed to maximize the operating performance of the entire segment 
resources at the operating segment level are allocated  as needed throughout the segment 
for example  in segment wide resources were utilized for the due diligence and integration work associated with both the roanoke and insulating glass acquisitions 
costs for these resources were not allocated to these individual business components 
for the full valu specialty segment in total  the net revenue increase due to product pricing in was percent as compared to sales volume decreases in of percent nearly offset the increases from pricing 
one less week in resulted in a decrease in net revenue of approximately percent as compared to approximately percent of the operating income increase in versus resulted from operating income generated from the businesses acquired during the paints component also made a strong contribution to the segment s operating income improvement in as compared to selling price increases  productivity improvements and overall cost control throughout the segment also contributed to the operating income improvement in as compared to in full valu specialty  the lean six sigma sm methodology was used extensively in the paints component as well as in the integration of the two acquisitions 
during the second quarter of the company reached settlements on numerous product liability cases related to the eifs product line see item legal proceedings  which is part of the specialty construction business component 
these settlements resulted in million of charges in sg a expenses in the second quarter 
the settlements significantly reduced the number of pending eifs claims and lawsuits against the company 

table of contents the increase in net revenue in as compared to resulted primarily from an increase in selling prices of percent and added volume from the extra week of approximately percent 
other volume increases were realized in the construction related components of the segment while volume declined in the paints component in central america 
operating income increased slightly in as compared to selling price increases were outpaced by raw material increases resulting in a lower gross margin in cost reductions and productivity improvements were implemented to offset the reduced margin 
specialty construction the increase in net revenue for the specialty construction component was entirely due to the roanoke acquisition that was completed in march 
the net revenue from roanoke did not meet the initial expectations for as the us construction market slowed down  but the products and knowledge acquired are still expected to provide substantial long term benefits 
another factor that had a negative impact on the net revenue generated by roanoke was inventory reductions at some of the large retail stores in the us excluding the roanoke revenue  specialty construction s selling prices were increased nearly percent in response to rising raw material costs 
sales volume declined partially due to the slowdown in construction activity in the us as compared to the increase in operating income in was nearly all related to roanoke 
the product liability settlements mentioned above had a million negative effect on the operating income 
the eifs related legal costs discussed in item legal proceedings are all related to specialty construction 
legal defense costs are expected to decrease significantly in as the number of pending eifs related cases has been significantly reduced in in  net revenue increased due to higher prices and increased volume 
the strength of the us construction market in contributed to the net revenue growth 
the operating income growth in resulted mainly from the increase in sales activity 
the gross profit margin declined in as raw material cost increases exceeded the rate of selling price increases 
paints the paints component experienced about percent net revenue growth in both and beginning in  the strategic focus of the business was aligned to the promotion of premium architectural brands  protecto and glidden  and a de emphasis on some of the low price commodity brands 
this shift in focus was driven by the fact that the paints market is very competitive and mature and in general  carries a lower operating profit margin 
this strategic focus continued in and led to an improved profit margin in versus a reorganization project initiated in resulted in cost savings in both manufacturing and sg a expense areas in this project was one area in which the lean six sigma methodology was utilized in full valu specialty 
these cost savings combined with the margin improvements from focusing on premium products resulted in the improved operating income in net revenue increases from higher selling prices were nearly offset by reductions in sales volume in as compared to operating income declined in because of higher raw material costs and also due to the costs of approximately million associated with the reorganization project mentioned above 
the reorganization was done in the second and third quarters of therefore the benefits were not fully realized until insulating glass the acquisition of the european insulating glass sealant business from henkel kgaa in june was the primary driver of net revenue growth in the insulating glass component in this strategic acquisition provides the company with access to additional technologies and geographies and a stronger platform from which to grow 
the insulating glass business in the us experienced volume growth through the first three quarters of through the continued growth in market share  but then slowed in the fourth quarter along with the us construction market 
operating income generated by the acquisition was the primary reason for the overall increase in the insulating glass component 
the operating income generated from the acquisition is expected to increase as it becomes fully integrated 
raw material costs increased significantly in  not all of which were recovered through price increases 

table of contents the percent growth experienced in was due to strong economic activity and increased market share driven by technology and quality differentiation 
raw material costs increased significantly during however the incremental sales volume and selling price increases allowed for the operating income to increase percent as compared to packaging solutions in  weak demand in north american packaging sales was offset by strong growth in international markets 
selling prices were increased in  however raw material costs increased at a faster pace resulting in a lower gross profit margin as compared to operating income was percent less than as sg a expenses were held at slightly below the levels 
the packaging solutions component has the highest level of consulting activity and value added solution activities that result in the higher profit margin as compared to the other full valu specialty components 
in addition to the extra week in versus  us demand increased partially due to stronger economic growth in as compared to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies offset the effects of higher raw material costs 
the higher net revenue combined with the manufacturing improvements drove the percent increase in operating income 
consumer in  sales of new products led to overall net revenue growth in the asia pacific region 
this was partially offset by the decision to exit certain commodity sealant product lines from certain markets in latin america 
the net effect was an improved product mix for the consumer component and higher operating income as compared to selling prices were increased more than five percent in as compared to  however that was not enough to cover the raw material cost increases 
operating income decreased in because of the higher raw material costs as well as costs associated with a reorganization in the latin america consumer component 
the net revenue variances in both and due to currency were primarily the result of fluctuations in the australian dollar versus the us dollar 
other the other section in the full valu specialty operating income table relates primarily to costs that had been allocated to the powder coatings business component  prior to its divestiture on december  these relate to costs that were fixed costs to the corporation that were not included in the costs of discontinued operations 
restructuring and other related costs the restructuring plan  which was contemplated in  approved and implemented throughout  was completed in as a result  approximately percent of the company s fiscal global manufacturing capacity was eliminated and the global adhesives operating segment sales force was realigned

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
this statement requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s over funded status or a liability for the plan s under funded status  measure the plans assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to other relevant accounting standards

measurement of the plans assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year is required to be adopted for fiscal years ending after december   which would be the fiscal year ending november  for the company 
based upon the december  balance sheet and pension disclosures  the impact of adopting sfas is estimated to be a decrease in assets of million  an increase in liabilities of million and an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
the effect of adoption will differ from the estimate due to actual plan asset and liability experience in fiscal forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates result primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of its variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso  brazilian real and chinese renminbi 
management s objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 

table of contents these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results  a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately million in net income or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  sustained strong economical growth in north america and china coupled with unplanned supplier production outages have led to strained supply demand situations for several key derivatives such as ethylene and propylene  some of their derivatives  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
in  the company s single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
