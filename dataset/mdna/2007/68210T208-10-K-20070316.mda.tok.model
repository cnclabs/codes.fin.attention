reclassification of financial statements effective june   we sold our aviation transportation services segment 
the income statements for the years ended december     and have been revised to properly present the comparative information related to the aviation transportation services segment 
for these periods  the activities of the aviation transportation services segment have been presented as discontinued operations 
general demand for our services 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data and oil and gas companies operating primarily in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
the level of activity for our services is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data and the exploration for oil and gas  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor  as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
seasonality and weather risks 
our operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours as our activities take place outdoors 
on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours

table of contents 
index to financial statements accounts receivable we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business

technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products primarily influence our estimates 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority 
the assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position  without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged 
if an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority  is recorded 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt
