item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing an overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
who we are we are an investment grade rated since  public equity  healthcare reit that seeks to provide stockholders with an attractive total return comprised of a secure  growing dividend and stock appreciation by passively investing in healthcare properties 
we are focused on the healthcare sector for two principal reasons we believe in its growth potential  as evidenced by the well known favorable demographics and growing market penetration of a rapidly growing elderly population and the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved senior housing  long term care and other healthcare alternatives  and our management team has extensive operating backgrounds in the senior housing and long term care components of this sector  which we believe provides us a competitive advantage 
what we invest in we invest passively in the following types of geographically diversified healthcare properties senior housing 
this primarily private pay backed sector breaks down into three principal categories  each of which may be operated on a stand alone basis or combined with one or more of the others into a single facility or campus independent living facilities ilfs designed for seniors who pay for some concierge type services eg  meals  housekeeping  laundry  transportation  and social and recreational activities but require little  if any  assistance with activities of daily living 
assisted living facilities alfs designed for frail seniors who can no longer live independently and instead need assistance with activities of daily living ie  feeding  dressing  bathing  etc 
but do not require round the clock skilled nursing care 
alzheimer facilities alzs designed for those residents with significant cognitive impairment as a result of having alzheimer s or related dementia 
long term care skilled nursing facilities snfs 
this primarily government medicare and medicaid reimbursement backed sector consists of skilled nursing facilities designed for inpatient rehabilitative  restorative  skilled nursing and other medical treatment for residents who are medically stable and do not require the intensive care of an acute care or rehabilitative hospital 
while our portfolio contains a number of notable exceptions  snfs typically have the look  feel and functionality of an institutional healthcare property rather than the more residential feel of senior housing 
continuing care retirement communities ccrcs 
these communities are designed to provide a continuum of care for residents as they age and their health deteriorates and typically combine on a defined campus integrated senior housing and long term care facilities 
medical office buildings mobs 
mobs operate differently from the above asset types that is  they do not provide inpatient long term care and senior housing 
rather  they are typically multi story buildings on or near an acute care hospital campus 
they usually house several different unrelated medical practices  although they can be associated with a large single specialty or multi specialty group 
mob tenants include physicians  dentists  psychologists  therapists and other healthcare providers  with space devoted to patient examination and treatment  diagnostic imaging  outpatient surgery and other outpatient services 

table of contents how we do it using a three prong foundation that focuses on proactive capital management  active portfolio management and quality funds from operations ffo growth  we invest in senior housing  long term care facilities and medical office buildings 
senior housing and long term care including ccrcs 
we primarily make our investments in these properties passively by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated tenants under triple net master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
to the tenants 
in addition  but to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater  from time to time  we extend mortgage loans and other financing to tenants  generally at higher rates than we charge for rent on our owned facilities 
currently  about of our revenues from this area are derived from our leases  with the remaining from our mortgage loans and other financing 
medical office buildings mobs 
mobs are not generally subject to triple net leases  and each mob generally has several tenants under separate leases  thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses although many of these are  or can effectively be  passed through to the tenants by the mob landlord as well 
since mobs are not generally subject to triple net leases  the owner receives the net operating income or loss related to the mob compared to the contractual rent stream associated with a triple net lease 
the mob landlord must manage the property day to day  collect rent from the disparate tenants  and re market space as it becomes vacant 
in short  the success or failure of an mob investment is meaningfully influenced by the strength and quality of the property management 
to date  we have invested in this property type through our joint venture with the broe companies broe and their experienced property manager  insite properties 
to further diversify our company and more directly participate in what we believe is the largest  still growing and least risky healthcare property group  we are seeking to acquire and or develop our own mob investment and development platform 
how we measure our progress funds from operations we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it excludes the effect of depreciation and gains losses from sales of facilities both of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
additionally  ffo is widely used by industry analysts as a measure of operating performance for equity reits 
we therefore discuss ffo  although it is a measurement that is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states it does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
what we have accomplished over the last three years we have enjoyed numerous accomplishments since  perhaps the most notable of which are as follows management smooth senior management transition 
the entire senior management team has been reconstituted over the past three years 
douglas pasquale became our chief executive officer in april  followed shortly by the promotion of donald bradley to chief investment officer in july  the hiring of abdo khoury as chief portfolio officer in august and his subsequent promotion to chief financial and portfolio officer in july  coupled with the promotion of david snyder to vice president and controller 
investments 
after having invested only million in  we achieved our third consecutive record investment year culminating in approximately billion of closed investments in doubled investment portfolio net investments in real estate have grown from billion at the beginning of to billion at the end of 
table of contents increased focus on private pay senior housing due in large part to our extensive senior housing operating backgrounds  we have been able to acquire a variety of assisted and independent living portfolios that have increased the private pay component of our portfolio represented by this asset class from at the beginning of to at the end of further asset diversification with first investment in medical office buildings in the first quarter of  we completed our first investment in mobs through our joint venture with broe 
capital more flexible and diverse structure and conservative balance sheet 
our overall capital goal has been to balance the debt and equity components of our capital structure  increase our sources of capital  enhance our credit statistics  preserve and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings moody s investors service baa  standard poor s ratings service bbb and fitch ratings bbb and improve our cost of capital to position ourselves to make accretive acquisitions in an increasingly competitive market 
we believe we have accomplished all of these goals  with the following items being particularly noteworthy credit facility increased from million at the beginning of to million in with substantially improved terms in capital markets issued approximately million of equity and million of long term debt in marketed deals with industry standard covenants while maintaining a consistent level of equity as a percentage of our capitalization 
controlled equity offering implemented this program under which we periodically issue equity at an average price over the volume weighted average price  subject to fees of about 
during  we issued approximately  shares of common stock under this program  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
joint venture capital formed a joint venture in january  after substantially negotiating terms in  with a state pension fund investor advised by morgan stanley real estate to provide an additional capital source 
the joint venture may invest up to million in assisted living  independent living and skilled nursing facilities 
asset management capital sold to brookdale for about million a capitalization rate on our rent senior housing assets previously leased to them  with the proceeds reinvested at an starting rent rate in new investments with new growth oriented customers  establishing yet another potential capital source 
portfolio management implemented sophisticated program 
with the hiring of abdo khoury in as chief portfolio officer  we embarked on a concerted effort to substantially improve our portfolio management program 
today we believe it is one of the most sophisticated in our industry 
dividend secure and growing 
as a result of all these efforts  we have lowered our dividend coverage ratio dividends per share divided by ffo per share from at the end of to at the end of while raising our annual dividend in two per share increments in january and july  our first dividend increases since july focus and outlook for in we will focus on improving our net income and ffo on an absolute and per share basis 
we expect the rent escalators in our leases  generally between and  to generate substantial net income growth and ffo growth 
while the market remains extremely competitive  we continue to see potentially attractive investment opportunities that we will carefully evaluate 
we will also explore alternative capital sources  investment structures and property types particularly with a focus on acquiring or developing an mob platform that would enable us to compete more effectively in the markets in which we currently invest 
this would potentially include additional joint ventures much like the one through which we made our first investment in medical office buildings in january and the one we initiated with a state pension fund in january 
table of contents in management s view  there continue to be four principal near term challenges we face in achieving our business objectives 
the first is the continued availability of competitively priced capital 
this in turn is largely dependent on external factors such as interest rates and equity market volatility 
short term interest rates rose significantly in and we believe some additional increase is possible in longer term rates were relatively flat for the year  and while many experts expect them to remain so for most of  it is certainly possible these rates may increase as well 
in addition  was another strong year for reit stock prices  especially for healthcare reits 
if debt capital becomes more expensive than we expect or equity prices fall in  it could adversely impact our ability to grow 
the second challenge is increasing interest in assets traditionally owned in our sector from a number of foreign and domestic capital providers  including some of our tenants  in addition to our healthcare reit competitors 
this increased competition is reducing rent yields and limiting our ability to successfully compete for attractive investment opportunities 
the third principal challenge is possible further consolidation at the reit level and continued consolidation at the operator level which is likely to result in better capitalized competitors and fewer customers 
finally  although we think less likely  there may be operator financial problems that lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular operator or it could be industry wide  such as federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their budget deficits  reduced occupancies for our assisted and independent living facilities due to general economic and other factors or increases in liability insurance premiums or other expenses 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition rental income from operating leases is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  including sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
our leases generally contain annual escalators 
many of our leases contain non contingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognizing income on a straight line basis requires us to calculate the total non contingent rent to be paid over the life of a lease and to recognize the revenue evenly over that life 
this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received  creating a deferred rent asset included in other assets on our balance sheet 
at some point during the lease  depending on its terms  the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight line rent which results in the deferred rent asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term 
we assess the collectibility of straight line rents in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and defer recognition of deferred rent if its collectibility is not reasonably assured 
certain leases contain escalators contingent on revenues or other factors  including increases based solely on the consumer price index 
such revenue increases are recognized over the lease term as the related contingencies occur 
our assessment of the collectibility of straight line rents is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the tenant  the type of facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current tenant  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we defer recognition of the straight line rental income and  depending on the circumstances  we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized deferred rent asset for a portion  up to 
table of contents its full value  that we estimate may not be recoverable 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease change  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized or to reserve or further reserve the existing deferred rent balance 
we recorded  of revenues in excess of cash received during   of cash received in excess of revenues during and  of cash received in excess of revenues during there is  at december   and  at december   of deferred rent receivables  net of reserves  recorded under the caption other assets on the balance sheet 
we evaluate the collectibility of the deferred rent balances on an ongoing basis and provide reserves against receivables we believe may not be fully recoverable 
the ultimate amount of deferred rent we realize could be less than amounts recorded 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally from to years 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to buildings generally approximately 
the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property are based on management s estimates 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

indicators may include  among others  a tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by a tenant that it will not renew its lease  or a decision to dispose of an asset or adverse changes in the fair value of any of our properties 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  in accordance with sfas no 
 we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than its current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less selling costs 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
during the year ended december   we recognized impairment charges of  related to two skilled nursing facilities in assets held for sale to write them down to their estimated fair values less selling costs 
during the year ended december   we recognized impairment charges of  related to two skilled nursing facilities  one facility that would no longer be operated as a skilled nursing facility and a land parcel in assets held for sale 
collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our rent  mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  the 
table of contents asset type and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that may not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable

operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  triple net lease rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired in  facilities acquired during and rent increases totaling  medical office building rent was generated by the medical office buildings we acquired through our joint venture with broe during the first quarter of interest and other income increased  or  over the increase was primarily due to five loans funded during  two loans funded during and a lease assumption fee included in other income  partially offset by loan repayments 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to increased borrowings to fund acquisitions in and  including the issuance of  of notes in july  an increase in the interest rates on our floating rate debt  the assumption of  of secured debt during and  during and obtaining a loan on the medical office building portfolio for  partially offset by interest savings from the prepayment of  of secured debt during and the extinguishment of  of notes in august depreciation and amortization increased  or  over the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of facilities in and facilities during  as well as the amortization of lease related intangible assets in the medical office building joint venture 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  over the increase was primarily due to the amortization of restricted stock grants and increases in other general corporate expenses 
medical office building operating expenses relate to the operations 
table of contents of the medical office building portfolio that was acquired during the first quarter of the medical office buildings are not triple net leased like the rest of our portfolio 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of  in continuing operations 
the impairment related to a receivable from the operator of two facilities  one of which was impaired for  in  which portion of the impairment is reported in discontinued operations because we transferred the building to assets held for sale sfas no 
requires the operating results of any assets with their own identifiable cash flows that are disposed of or held for sale be removed from income from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations 
the operating results for any such assets for any prior periods presented must also be reclassified as discontinued operations 
discontinued operations income increased  versus discontinued operations income of  for the year ended december  was comprised of gains on sale of  rent revenue of  and interest and other income of  partially offset by depreciation of  asset impairment charges of  and general and administrative expenses of  discontinued operations income of  for the year ended december  was comprised of rent revenue of  gains on sale of  and interest and other income of  partially offset by asset impairment charges of  depreciation of  general and administrative expenses of  and interest and amortization of deferred financing costs of  the difference in the composition of discontinued operations income excluding the gains and impairments was primarily caused by the fact that income from facilities sold during and is included in discontinued operations in while only income from facilities sold in is included in discontinued operations in we expect to have future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale  and the related income or loss would be included in discontinued operations 
our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if facility revenues and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not increase 
rent levels under renewed leases will also impact revenues 
as of december   we had leases on eight facilities expiring in the exercise of purchase options by our tenants would also decrease rental income 
we believe our tenants may exercise purchase options on assets with option prices totaling approximately  during which would result in revenue leakage in of approximately  full year impact is approximately  however  actual options exercised may be higher or lower than our estimates 
we expect to make additional acquisitions during  although we cannot predict the quantity and timing of any such acquisitions 
as we make additional investments in facilities  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by associated rental or interest income 
while additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase revenues  facility sales or mortgage repayments would serve to offset any revenue increases and could reduce revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  triple net lease rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired in  facilities acquired during and rent increases totaling  the increase was partially offset by rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us during interest and other income decreased  or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff of ten mortgage loans during  partially offset by two new mortgage loans receivable funded during interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to interest on the  of notes issued in may  the assumption of  of secured debt during the first half of and  during  an increase in the interest rates on our floating rate debt and an increase in the average balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  of notes during the third quarter  the prepayment of  of secured debt during the third quarter  the 
table of contents repayment of  of secured debt during the third quarter and the repayment of  of notes during the third quarter depreciation and amortization increased  or over the increase was primarily due to the acquisition or facilities in and facilities during general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to the amortization of restricted stock grants and increases in other general corporate expenses 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of  in continuing operations 
the impairment related a receivable from the operator of two facilities  one of which was impaired for  in  which portion of the impairment is reported in discontinued operations because we transferred the building to assets held for sale 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of  due to the repurchase of  of notes in the third quarter 
prior to our acquisition of jer senior housing  llc s jer interest in our joint venture in may of  income from unconsolidated joint venture represented our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee 
the decrease of  or  in as compared to is due to the recognition of only four months of income in prior to our acquisition and the recognition of our share  equal to  of a gain on the sale of one of the joint venture s facilities of  partially offset by charges related to the refinance of the joint venture s debt  consisting of the write off of deferred finance charges  our share of which was  and a prepayment fee  our share of which was  compared to twelve months of income in please see the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the formerly unconsolidated joint venture

we hold a equity interest in the venture and broe holds 
broe is the managing member  but we consolidate the joint venture 
the accounting policies of the joint venture are consistent with our accounting policies 
no investments were made by or into this joint venture prior to during  cash distributions of  and  were made to us and to broe  respectively 
during  the joint venture acquired medical office buildings in six states 
the purchase price totaled  of which  was originally allocated to real estate   was allocated to in place leases related assets and  was allocated to other assets and liabilities 
the joint venture was originally financed with a bridge loan from us of  capital contributions from us of  capital contributions from broe of  and assumed mortgages on three facilities totaling  the bridge loan from us was replaced on april  by third party mortgage financing in the amount of  funding up to  available under the financing agreement 
all intercompany balances with the joint venture have been eliminated for purposes of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents investment in unconsolidated joint venture during  we entered into a joint venture with jer  a wholly owned subsidiary of jer partners  an institutional investor 
the joint venture was established to invest in healthcare facilities similar to those already owned by us 
the financial statements of the joint venture were not consolidated with our financial statements and our investment was accounted for using the equity method 
on may   we acquired jer s interest in our joint venture  jer nhp senior housing  llc  for approximately  as part of this transaction  we assumed the secured debt the joint venture had in place of approximately  approximately  of which represented jer s share  resulting in a payment to jer of approximately  net of other costs and fees related to buying out their interest of approximately  from the transaction date forward  the operations of jer nhp senior housing  llc have been consolidated with our existing operations 
during  prior to our acquisition of jer s interest  the joint venture sold one facility for net cash proceeds of  resulting in a gain of  included in discontinued operations of the joint venture 
in january  we entered into a definitive joint venture agreement with a state pension fund investor advised by morgan stanley real estate 
the purpose of the joint venture will be to acquire and develop assisted living  independent living and skilled nursing facilities 
we will manage and own of the joint venture  which will fund its investments of up to million with approximately equity contributions and debt 
we expect that this joint venture will be an unconsolidated entity 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased  or  in as compared to this was primarily due to revenue increases from our owned facilities and mortgage loans as a result of acquisitions and funding of mortgage loans during and  offset in part by increased interest and general and administrative expenses 
there have been no significant changes in the underlying sources and uses of cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities during  we acquired assisted and independent living facilities and skilled nursing facilities in separate transactions for an aggregate investment of  including the assumption of  of mortgage financing 
these amounts include our acquisition and master leaseback on june  of the real estate holdings of hearthstone assisted living inc  consisting of assisted living and alzheimer s facilities located in ten states  for a total investment of approximately  including debt defeasance and closing costs 
we also funded  in expansions  construction and capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with existing lease provisions 
such expansions  construction and capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by us on these facilities 
the acquisitions  expansions  construction and capital improvements were funded by borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by cash on hand 
at december   we had committed to fund additional expansions  construction and capital improvements of approximately  during  we also acquired medical office buildings through a joint venture with broe for  including the assumption of  of mortgage financing 
during  we sold skilled nursing facilities and five assisted and independent living facilities  excluding the transactions with brookdale senior living  inc brookdale discussed below  for cash proceeds of  we provided two mortgage loans aggregating  related to the sale of three of these 
table of contents facilities to the former tenants 
these sales resulted in a recognized gain of  that is included in gain on sale of facilities in discontinued operations 
on december   we sold assisted and independent living facilities to brookdale for net cash proceeds of  these facilities were previously leased to brookdale 
the proceeds from this transaction provided an alternative source of low cost capital and were used to fund accretive acquisitions 
this transaction resulted in a recognized gain of  that is included in gain on sale of facilities in discontinued operations 
on july   brookdale acquired american senior living lp  which previously leased ten facilities from us 
terms of the lease for five assisted and independent living facilities provided for purchase options exercisable on july  one of the goals of our portfolio management program is to retain the revenue stream from our newer and better performing assets for as long as possible 
in this instance  we were able to negotiate a solution that allowed us to retain the revenue stream for an additional year  and allowed brookdale to take advantage of the deprecation deduction related to the assets immediately 
as a result  we sold these five facilities to brookdale for  and provided a mortgage loan for that amount 
this transaction resulted in a deferred gain of  also  during  we funded two mortgage loans  excluding loans for facilities sold in the transactions discussed above  secured by one skilled nursing facility and one land parcel totaling  in addition  three mortgage loans receivable were prepaid 
financing activities on december   we amended our  credit facility credit facility 
the prior  revolving credit commitment maturing october  and the  term credit commitment maturing october  were replaced with a four year  revolving senior unsecured credit facility maturing on december  the maturity date may be extended by one additional year at our discretion 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at prime at december  or applicable libor plus at december  
we pay a facility fee of per annum on the total commitment under the agreement 
at december   we had  available under our credit facility 
on may   in connection with the acquisition of hearthstone assisted living  inc  we entered into a  credit agreement bridge facility 
the bridge facility matured on september   and accordingly  no amounts were outstanding at december  our credit facility requires us to maintain  among other things  the financial covenants detailed below covenant requirement actual minimum net asset value maximum total indebtedness to capitalization value minimum fixed charge coverage ratio maximum secured indebtedness ratio maximum unencumbered asset value ratio the amendment allows us to exceed the requirements  up to a maximum of  on the maximum total indebtedness to capitalization value and maximum unencumbered asset value ratio for up to two consecutive fiscal quarters 
under the amendment  the minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio was removed 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the above covenants 
we believe we have sufficient margin in the various debt covenants that we expect to remain in compliance throughout 
table of contents on july   we issued  of notes due july  at a fixed rate of resulting in net proceeds of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility and bridge facility 
in june  we entered into two  two month treasury lock agreements at rates of and in order to hedge the expected interest payments associated with a portion of the  of notes 
the treasury lock agreements were settled in cash on july   concurrent with the pricing of the  of notes  for the present value of the difference between the locked treasury rates and the unwind rate equal to the then prevailing treasury rate less the forward premium or 
the prevailing treasury rate exceeded the rates in the treasury lock agreements  thus the counterparty made payments to us of  the settlement amounts are being amortized over the life of the debt as a yield reduction 
during  we repaid  of fixed rate notes with a weighted average rate of 
the repayments were funded by borrowings on our credit facility and by cash on hand 
we anticipate repaying medium term notes at maturity with a combination of proceeds from borrowings on our credit facility and cash on hand 
we currently have  of notes maturing in there are also  of notes due in which may be put back to us at their face amount at the option of the holder on october st of specified years  including october  borrowings on our credit facility could be repaid by potential asset sales or the repayment of mortgage loans receivable  the potential issuance of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statements discussed below or cash from operations 
our medium term notes have been investment grade rated since our credit ratings at december  were baa from moody s investors service  bbb from standard poor s ratings services and bbb from fitch ratings 
during  we prepaid  of secured debt with a weighted average rate of 
the prepayments were funded by borrowings on our credit facility and by cash on hand 
on april   we closed on the sale of  shares of common stock including the underwriters over allotment option of  shares at per share net of the underwriters discounts 
in addition  we entered into forward sale agreements with affiliates of certain underwriters relating to  shares of common stock 
these agreements gave us the option of settling the  forward shares in shares of common stock or cash at any time during the twelve months following the closing date 
we settled the contracts by issuing  shares on june  at a price of per share the from the original sale as adjusted for interest earned and dividends paid from the forward sale date to the settlement date to settle the forward sale agreements

we sponsor a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan that enables existing stockholders to purchase additional shares of common stock by automatically reinvesting all or part of the cash dividends paid on their shares of common stock 
the plan also allows investors to acquire shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including a maximum monthly investment of  at a discount ranging from to  determined by us from time to time in accordance with the plan

in addition  at december   we had approximately  shares of common stock available for issuance under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
if our stockholders approve an increase to the number of authorized shares of common stock  we anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement for up to billion of securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
if a new shelf registration statement is filed  we anticipate rolling over any unused amounts of securities in our current shelf registration statement into the new registration statement

we anticipate the possible sale of certain facilities  primarily due to purchase option exercises 
in addition  mortgage loans receivable might be prepaid 
in the event that there are facility sales or mortgage loan receivable repayments in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any facility sales or mortgage loans receivable repayments to provide capital for future investments  to reduce the outstanding balance on our credit facility or to repay other borrowings as they mature 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe the combination of the available balance of  on our  credit facility and the availability under the shelf registration statements provides sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we may hold derivative instruments to manage our exposure to these risks  and all derivative instruments are matched against specific debt obligations 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in 
table of contents conjunction with our disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
we provide mortgage loans to tenants of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations  which generally have fixed rates 
some mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rates are equal to the then current rates 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain healthcare facilities or other mortgage debt 
during the twelve months ended december   the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility have decreased from  to  for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt other than the housing revenue bonds described above  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate
