competition the company s newspapers  direct marketing programs and internet sites compete for advertising revenues and readers time with television  radio  other internet sites  direct mail companies  free shoppers  suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications  and billboard companies  among others 
in some of its markets  the company s newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and towns 
competition for advertising is generally based upon circulation levels  readership demographics  price  internet usage and advertiser results  while competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon the content  journalistic quality  service and the price of the newspaper 
the company s major daily newspapers lead their direct local newspaper competitors in both advertising linage and general circulation and readership in their respective markets  and its internet sites are generally the leading local sites in each of the company s major daily newspaper markets  based upon research conducted by the company and various independent sources 
nonetheless  the company has experienced a greater shift of advertising in the classified categories to online advertising and faces greater competition  particularly in the areas of employment  automotive and real estate advertising  by online competitors 
employees labor as of december   the company had  full and part time employees equating to  full time equivalent employees  of whom approximately were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements expiring in various years 
twenty one of the company s daily papers have no unions 
while the company s newspapers have not had a strike for decades and do not currently anticipate a strike occurring  the company cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of its newspapers when future negotiations occur 
the company believes that  in the event of a newspaper strike  it would be able 
table of contents to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers  a capability which is critical to retaining revenues from advertising and circulation  although there can be no assurance of this

risk factors that could affect operating results forward looking information this report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding the company s actual and expected financial performance and operations 
these statements are based upon our current expectations and knowledge of factors impacting our business  including  without limitation  statements about litigation  successful disposition of the minneapolis star tribune newspaper  tax and other benefits from the sale of the star tribune  advertising revenues  return on pension plan assets and assumed salary increases  newsprint costs  amortization expense  stock option expenses  prepayment of debt  capital expenditures  sufficiency of capital resources and possible acquisitions and investments 
such statements are subject to risks  trends and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are generally preceded by  followed by or are a part of sentences that include the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions 
for all of those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements general economic  market or business conditions  especially in any of the markets where we operate newspapers  impact of any litigation or any potential litigation  geo political uncertainties including the risk of war  changes in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs from anticipated levels  changes in interest rates  changes in pension assets and liabilities  increased competition from newspapers  internet sites or other forms of media reaching the markets we serve  increased consolidation among major retailers in our markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  changes in our ability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining agreements with unions  competitive action by other companies  difficulties in servicing our debt obligations  other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from retail  classified and national advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
additional information regarding certain risks the company s primary source of revenue is advertising  followed by circulation revenues 
in recent years  the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward internet advertising and away from other traditional media 
in addition  the company s circulation has declined over the last two years  reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including consumer migration toward the internet and other media for news and information 
the company has attempted to take advantage of the growth of online media and advertising by operating local internet sites in each of its daily newspaper markets  but faces increasing competition from other online sources for both advertising and circulation revenues 
this increased competition has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results  including negatively impacting revenues and margins 
newsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses for fiscal accordingly  our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
we have not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if our newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect our operating results 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results 
our newspapers have not endured a 
table of contents labor strike for decades 
however  we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of our newspapers in the future 
as of december   approximately of our full time and part time employees were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times 
mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if our newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our newspaper operations 
the company continues to evaluate its business and make strategic investments in digital ventures  either alone or with partners  to further its growth in its online businesses 
there can be no assurances that these investments or partnerships will result in growth in advertising or will produce equity income in future years 
the company expects to realize cost savings of approximately million in the first year of ownership from the acquisition  primarily by reducing redundancy in staffing for corporate and digital functions  and to a lesser extent  savings at the individual newspaper level through combined purchasing of products and capital expenditures 
there is no assurance that these cost savings will be realized in the amount or timing that management has projected 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in total consolidated debt outstanding 
this debt could increase the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
debt service costs are subject to interest rate changes as well as any changes in the company s credit ratings 
negative changes in credit ratings could increase the level of debt service costs and also affect the company s future ability to refinance certain maturing debt  or affect the ultimate structure of such refinancing 
the company expects to use the sale of the minneapolis star tribune to reduce debt in the first quarter of fiscal  and expects that over the next several years its primary use of cash flow from operations will be to reduce debt

the company s primary source of revenue is advertising  which accounts for roughly of the company s revenue in any given year in fiscal 
while percentages vary from year to year and from newspaper to newspaper  retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising generally contributes roughly of advertising revenues at the company s newspapers in fiscal 
recent trends have been for certain national or regional retailers to use greater preprint and online advertising and less rop advertising  although that trend shifts from time to time 
nonetheless  rop advertising still makes up the majority of retail advertising 
classified advertising including online classified advertising primarily in automotive  employment and real estate categories  generally contributes about of advertising revenue in fiscal and national advertising generally contributes about of total advertising in fiscal 
direct marketing and other advertising make up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues 
circulation revenues contribute roughly in fiscal of the company s newspaper revenues  depending upon the size and locale of the newspaper 
most newspapers are delivered by independent contractors 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
see the following results of operations for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by category for fiscal  and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s accounting for income taxes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from advertising placed in a newspaper and or on a website over the advertising contract period or as services are delivered  as appropriate  and recognizes circulation revenues as newspapers are delivered over the applicable subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable  reserving for all accounts due days or longer  to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the company becomes aware that the financial condition of a customer has deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
acquisition accounting pursuant to emerging issues task force no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination  mcclatchy common stock issued on june  was valued based upon the average closing price of the mcclatchy s common stock from march  through march  two business days before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced  or per share 
as a result  the fair value of the million shares of the mcclatchy s common stock issued in the acquisition was recorded at billion  which was included in the total acquisition purchase price of approximately billion 
the fair value of such shares declined to approximately billion as of the acquisition closing date june   however  the decline of million in valuation had no effect on the total acquisition purchase price recorded 
this difference is included in the allocation to goodwill in the allocation of the purchase price 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
pursuant to sfas  business combinations  the purchase price is being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of june   the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price allocation was primarily based upon an independent valuation report 
the purchase price allocation  while substantially completed  is subject to further adjustments based upon completion of analyses of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and other items 
discontinued operations on june   the company acquired knight ridder and subsequently sold of the daily newspapers acquired in the acquisition 
four of the newspaper sales closed concurrently with the closing of the acquisition and eight were held by the company from two to days 
on december   the company entered into an agreement to sell the minneapolis star tribune newspaper 
as a result  the company has recorded the results of the eight former knight ridder newspapers and the star tribune newspaper as discontinued operations  including interest on debt related to the purchase of the newspapers 
no gain or loss was recorded on the sale of the former knight ridder newspapers  but discontinued operations does reflect a write down of the star tribune s net assets to fair market value based upon its expected sales proceeds 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more discussion of discontinued operations 
goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company periodically analyzes its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment 
see the discussion of the sale of the minneapolis star tribune newspaper below related to the write down to net realizable value recorded in discontinued operations in fiscal pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company is required to 
table of contents consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans requires recognition of the funded status of a pension plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation and funded status of a post retirement plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
as required  the company adopted this statement on december  and its net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets at december  were million 
this amount includes million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of assets for qualified plans netted to a million liability 
the company used discount rates of to  assumed salary rate increases of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in  based upon consultation with its outside actuaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
for fiscal  a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on the company s net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million 
the company has revised certain assumptions for its fiscal retirement plan calculations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used to value its year end pension obligations and fiscal expense 
income tax provision the company s current and deferred tax income provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if needed  throughout the year 
adjustments between the company s estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by federal and state authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
the company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is significantly affected by management judgments 
management believes that the company has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters based upon currently available information 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities when the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  earnings or deductions estimated to be in each jurisdiction by the company may differ from actual amounts 
as a result of these potential adjustments  the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the anticipated minneapolis star tribune disposition  the company s mix of state tax jurisdictions has resulted in a lower overall state tax rate 
accordingly  the company has recalculated its deferred tax liabilities and assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal at its new lower effective state tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was affected by similar calculations related to the acquisition in both the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal 
table of contents also as a result of the tax loss on the sale of the star tribune newspaper  the company expects to receive net cash income tax benefits of approximately million by the company recorded a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million when it wrote down the net assets of the star tribune newspaper to its fair market value based upon its expected sales proceeds 
however  when the transaction closes expected in the first quarter of fiscal  the company will recognize additional income tax expense estimated to be million related to the dissolution of subsidiaries holding star tribune related intellectual property 
these taxes will be recorded in discontinued operations 
insurance the company is insured for workers compensation using both self insurance and large deductible programs 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate provision for insurance claims 
the company used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate or a increase in claims would have had an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
stock based compensation the company implemented financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  at the beginning of fiscal and recorded share based compensation of million in the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology of calculating stock based compensation

the after tax proceeds from the sales of the eight knight ridder newspapers sold after the acquisition closed were used to reduce debt 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of june   the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price allocation  while substantially completed  is subject to further adjustments based upon completion of analyses of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and other items

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation specifies requirements for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective beginning on january  the company is currently evaluating the impact fin will have  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 
advertising revenues classified advertising revenues slowed over the course of fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in classified advertising partially reflected an industry wide slowdown in automotive advertising that began in in  employment advertising began to slow in most markets 
while real estate advertising remained strong in the first three quarters of fiscal  increases in long term interest rates and the resulting drop in home sales caused real estate advertising revenue declines at many newspapers in the fourth quarter of fiscal national advertising also declined in fiscal reflecting a slowdown in a number of segments including telecommunications and automotive manufacturing 
these declines were partially offset by growth in retail  direct marketing and online advertising 
see the revenue discussions in management s review of the company s results of operations 

table of contents newsprint the company incurred three newsprint price increases in fiscal and one newsprint price increase in fiscal newsprint expense was higher than pro forma newsprint expense in fiscal  reflecting higher prices  offset partially by lower newsprint usage 
newsprint pricing is dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
a significant increase in newsprint prices would increase the company s operating expenses 
however  because the company has ownership interests in newsprint producers ponderay and sp  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting operating expenses  would increase its share of earnings from these investments 
ponderay and sp could also be impacted by higher energy and other factors that would impact their results 
the impact of newsprint price increases on the company s financial results is discussed under results of operations 
results of operations the company noted the following items related to the acquisition and other matters that impacted fiscal results the company issued approximately million class a shares in connection with the acquisition

additionally  the results of star tribune s operations have been recorded as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
the company implemented financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payments fas r  at the beginning of fiscal and recorded share based compensation of million in the year ended december  as a result of the anticipated minneapolis star tribune disposition  the company s mix of state tax jurisdictions has resulted in a lower overall state tax rate 
the company recalculated its deferred tax liabilities and assets at the new lower effective state tax rate 
the effective tax rate was affected by similar calculations related to the acquisition in both the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal the fourth quarter of fiscal income tax provision was reduced by million  and the full year
