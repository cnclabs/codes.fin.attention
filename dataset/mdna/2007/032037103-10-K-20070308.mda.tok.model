item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation the corporation currently operates in two business segments the forged and cast rolls segment and the air and liquid processing segment 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel  one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with its principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana  and davy roll company limited davy roll  a producer of cast rolls with facilities in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment consists of aerofin corporation aerofin  buffalo air handling company buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  inc buffalo pumps 
aerofin and buffalo air handling have operations in virginia and buffalo pumps is located in new york 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process  and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling produces custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
the forged and cast rolls segment continues to benefit from the increased level of steel production  particularly in china  and unprecedented demand for its products resulting from the worldwide shortage of roll capacity 
year end backlog unfilled orders on hand and current demand provide confidence that these operations  particularly union electric steel  will operate at capacity for the next few years 
customers concerned with continuity of roll availability have entered into long term supply arrangements creating large backlogs going out several years 
these arrangements include provisions to cover increases in the cost of steel scrap and alloys and penalties for cancellation of orders 
emphasis for this segment will be to maximize capacity and the most favorable product mix while maintaining the reliability of equipment  superior quality  and on time delivery 
the outlook for the foreseeable future is good with improved sales and income from operations expected in results for the air and liquid processing segment were severely impacted in by a  pre tax charge for estimated settlement and defense costs of pending and future asbestos claims offset by estimated insurance recoveries see note to consolidated financial statements 
these claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiary companies within the air and liquid processing group 
due primarily to the uncertainty in the number and nature of future claims and the cost to resolve them  the corporation determined it could only reasonably estimate such costs for a period of seven years ending december excluding this asbestos provision  the segment had improved operating results in comparison to the prior year most notably due to the elimination of operating losses at buffalo air handling 
the focus for these companies will be to strengthen sales distribution  continue to search for additional product lines  and  because of near full employment in central virginia  address the shortage of labor potentially by opening a leased satellite plant 
the outlook for the segment in is for sales and operating results comparable to  excluding the  charge for asbestos litigation 
ampco pittsburgh annual report consolidated results of operations overview consolidated sales and operating income loss for  and are indicated below 
a full discussion of the operating results for each of the segments is presented later in this section 
the corporation net sales forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing total income loss from operations forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing corporate costs total backlog forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing total in comparison to the prior years  sales for improved significantly for each of the segments on higher volumes and  for the forged and cast rolls group  improved pricing 
additionally  sales for the forged and cast rolls group for were negatively affected by a flood at one of its domestic finishing plants 
operating income for includes a  charge for estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries  for a period of seven years ending december  the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment 
excluding this charge  operating income for the corporation improved over the prior year principally from increased sales of the forged and cast rolls group 
additionally  pension related costs decreased  due primarily to a higher expected rate of return on plan assets 
elimination of operating losses at the air handling operation improved income for the air and liquid processing group 
operating income for improved over the flood impaired results of and is attributable primarily to the performance of the forged and cast rolls segment including receipt of  of proceeds from its flood related business interruption insurance claim 
additionally  pension related costs decreased approximately due principally to curtailment of the uk defined benefit pension plan as of december  operating income for the air and liquid processing segment for decreased from as a result of an operating loss for the air handling operation 
the increase in backlog at december  against december  and is primarily attributable to the forged and cast rolls segment and increased demand for rolling mill rolls 
in addition  a shortage in roll manufacturing capacity has forced customers to place orders considerably in advance of shipment dates  accordingly  approximately  or of the backlog is scheduled for release beyond gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales approximated   and for  and  respectively 
the improvement is primarily attributable to better margins for the forged and cast rolls segment resulting from higher pricing and the variable index surcharge program implemented in which helps to protect the corporation against swings in the cost of steel scrap and alloys used in the manufacturing of rolls 
by comparison  part of and all of were negatively impacted by fixed price contracts and the inability to pass on higher costs which also put certain uk sales commitments in a loss position resulting in an additional charge to earnings 
the segment benefited from settlement of the flood related business interruption insurance claim in  but had uninsured costs associated therewith in ampco pittsburgh annual report selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales  and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the increase is due principally to higher sales commissions which are at fixed percentage and  accordingly  increase as sales increase 
the charge for asbestos litigation in represents the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries  for a period of seven years ending december  the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest and dividend income for further improved from and due to higher investment balances  an increase in rates of return  and receipt of the first dividend of from the corporation s uk chinese cast roll joint venture company 
interest expense increased in from the prior years due to higher interest rates on the corporation s variable rate industrial revenue bonds 
other income expense fluctuated primarily as a result of higher foreign exchange gains in versus and losses in the corporation s statutory income tax rate ranges between which compares to an effective rate of  and for  and  respectively 
for and  the provision for income taxes was reduced by the reversal of approximately  and  respectively  of valuation allowances previously provided against deferred income tax assets principally of the uk operations resulting in an overall income tax benefit for each of the years 
further improvement in earnings in and the expectation of sufficient income in future years made it more likely than not that the majority of the remaining deferred income tax assets would be realized  accordingly  the corresponding valuation allowances were released 
previously  in  a portion of the valuation allowances were released as a result of favorable earnings and the expectation of income in future years sufficient to utilize some of the loss carry forwards thus making it more likely than not that some of the deferred income tax assets would be realized 
beneficial permanent differences for the domestic operations also favorably impacted the effective rate for and for  losses for the uk operations for which no income tax benefit was provided and minimal taxable income for the domestic operations due to permanent tax benefits reduced its effective rate below the statutory rate 
as a result of the above  the corporation earned  or per common share for and  or per common share for in comparison to a net loss of  or per common share for forged and cast rolls sales operating income loss backlog world wide demand coupled with a shortage of forged roll production capacity continued to bolster sales for and operating income improved on the additional volume and higher margins 
with over three fourths of the segment s sales to customers outside its domestic borders  the weak dollar  in relationship to most international currencies  aided business 
the variable index surcharge program implemented in helps to protect the corporation against swings in the cost of steel scrap and alloys used in the manufacturing of rolls 
by comparison  part of and all of were negatively impacted by fixed price contracts and the inability to pass on these higher costs which also put certain uk sales commitments in a loss position resulting in an additional charge to earnings 
proceeds of  from its business interruption insurance claim relating to flood damage caused by remnants of hurricane ivan in were received in and are included in earnings in comparison to lost sales and uninsured costs for order backlogs have continued to improve in from and and are indicative of the increase in global demand coupled with customers ordering their roll requirements one and two years in advance to ensure continuity of supply 
approximately  or of the december  backlog is scheduled for shipment beyond ampco pittsburgh annual report air and liquid processing sales operating loss income backlog the charge for asbestos litigation relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment severely impacted earnings for see note to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the  asbestos related charge  earnings improved in due primarily to elimination of losses at the air handling operation which  in  was suffering from weak demand 
although volumes have improved  margins remain depressed 
with respect to aerofin  sales continued to improve in as a result of strong demand from oem customers 
margins on these products  however  are lower  accordingly  operating income remained comparable to a higher content of the more profitable nuclear work in improved aerofin sales and operating income from while sales and operating income for buffalo pumps remained relatively flat in and  each improved in due to a higher volume of commercial pumps for the power generation industry and pumps for navy shipbuilders 
in addition to the above mentioned asbestos related charge  uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation approximated  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in backlog as of december  is attributable primarily to improved demand for air handling equipment and coils 
approximately or of the december  backlog is scheduled for shipment beyond liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities were positive for  and at   and  respectively 
the increase for is primarily attributable to the positive cash flow effect from higher earnings 
while the  charge for asbestos litigation recorded in the fourth quarter of reduces earnings  it does not impact cash flows for instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a number of years see note to consolidated financial statements with an estimated net to be paid in the overall improvement in the corporation s business activity resulted in higher sales in the fourth quarter of increasing accounts receivable as of december  in comparison to and similarly  inventories were higher due to stronger demand for product  particularly rolling mill rolls  and other current liabilities  primarily customer related liabilities such as product warranties and deposits received on future orders  increased due to the overall increase in business activity 
in  the corporation received  of proceeds from its business interruption insurance claim it filed for damage caused to its principal roll finishing facility in pennsylvania as a result of remnants from hurricane ivan 
net cash flows provided by used in investing activities were   and  in  and  respectively

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents estimated contributions to the us non qualified defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plan and the curtailed davy roll defined benefit pension plan 
additional contributions may be necessary for the davy roll defined benefit pension plan as a result of its unfunded status  however  such amounts  if any  are currently not determinable 
no contributions are required in to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and amounts to be contributed in the future  if any  are currently not known 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents agreements to purchase goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding 
with respect to environmental matters  the corporation is currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned and has been named a potentially responsible party at three third party landfill sites 
in addition  as a result of the sale of the plastics processing machinery segment  the corporation retained the liability to remediate certain environmental contamination at two of the sold locations and has agreed to indemnify the buyer against third party claims arising from the discharge of certain contamination from one of these locations 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required  and identification of new sites 
however  in the opinion of management  the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately  accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature and scope of the corporation s business brings it into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  the corporation and its subsidiaries from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  the corporation does not anticipate that its financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in multiple claims for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components used in certain products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced in  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
additionally  product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment against the volatility in the cost of raw materials 
ampco pittsburgh annual report application of critical accounting policies the corporation has identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  litigation  environmental matters  and income taxes 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from the corporation s actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover  and discount rates 
specifically  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid out over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
consideration is also given to historical rates of return and the mix of investments 
for the domestic plan  the rates of return earned on the market related value of plan assets averaged for the ten year period of accordingly  the corporation believes the expected long term rate of return of for its domestic plan as of december  to be reasonable 
the foreign plan was formed in connection with the acquisition of the uk operations with plan assets transferred from the seller s plan to a newly created plan in october the rates of return earned on the market value of the plan assets averaged for accordingly  the corporation believes the assumed long term rate of return of as of december  to be reasonable 
the discount rates utilized in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
the corporation believes the assumed rates of and as of december  for its domestic and u 
k plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
the corporation believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  goodwill is no longer amortized but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in connection with the corporation s strategic planning process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information and represents the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions  pricing and volume 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amount recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for goodwill of  is recoverable and is not impaired as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of certain of the corporation s operating subsidiaries asbestos liability and of an inactive subsidiary of the corporation 
other than an accrual for certain deductible features of its relevant insurance polices  prior to the fourth quarter of  the corporation had not accrued for settlement or defense costs for pending claims for asbestos liability nor for settlement or defense costs for claims that may be asserted against certain subsidiaries and the corporation in the future 
for prior periods  the corporation did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of pending or future claims 
to assist the corporation in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability  along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amount of any estimates  the corporation hired nationally recognized asbestos liability experts and insurance consultants 
the experts were not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary  which the corporation believes are immaterial 
based on their analyses  the corporation has established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  through  and has also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that are deemed probable 
these amounts rely on assumptions that are based on currently known facts and strategy 
the corporation s actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect the corporation s asbestos liability and ability to recover under its insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
the corporation intends to evaluate its estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a periodic basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these periodic reviews may result in the corporation incurring future charges  however  the corporation is currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to the corporation s estimate of its recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable is recorded  and to the corporation s liquidity and consolidated financial position 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required  and identification of new sites 
the corporation believes the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  its tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of the corporation s operations 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if the corporation determined it would not be able to realize all or part of deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if the corporation determined it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  it would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   the corporation has deferred income tax assets approximating  net of a valuation allowance of  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on judgment as to the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event the corporation determines that tax related items would no longer be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential deficiencies  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
the corporation believes the potential liability for potential tax deficiencies based on information known to date has been adequately reserved

ampco pittsburgh annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation views its primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  the corporation s policy is to hedge a portion of its foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and foreign sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of the corporation s foreign operation may increase and gross margins improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for the corporation s domestic operations may increase and gross margins improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of its raw materials and energy  the corporation enters into contracts for a particular commodity copper and purchases a portion of its energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  scrap and alloys would have approximately a  and  impact in and  respectively 
the ability to pass these increases on to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with the corporation having to potentially absorb a significant portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect the corporation against such commodity price increases
