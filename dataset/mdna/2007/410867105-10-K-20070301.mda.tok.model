the results of afliac s variable life insurance and annuity operations are reported as discontinued operations 
hanover insurance and citizens are domiciled in the states of new hampshire and michigan  respectively  while faflic is domiciled in massachusetts 
executive overview as a result of the sale of the variable life insurance and annuity business in december  the property and casualty business constitutes our primary ongoing operations 
our property and casualty business includes personal lines business  commercial lines business and other property and casualty business 
in our personal lines business  we are focused on making investments that are intended to help us maintain profitability  build a distinctive position in the market and continue to provide us with profitable growth opportunities 
we expect that our focus will be on the expansion of our distribution capabilities by actively seeking to write more business with our best agents  and the development of new relationships with agents in the states where we conduct business 
at the same time  we expect continued growth from the significant investments made during the past several years to strengthen our product offerings  including from connections auto  our multivariate auto product  which is now available in seventeen states and accounts for most of our new personal automobile business 
part of our strategy is to broaden our product portfolio offerings and write whole accounts  which are accounts that include multiple personal line coverages for the same customer 
as such  we have made investments in our homeowners product  including an upgrade to our homeowners product released in september that enhanced our agents ease of doing business and decreased quote times 
we expect to introduce further homeowners product enhancements through a new homeowners product  to be branded connections home  in several states during the first half of additionally  we are making investments in and looking to grow our umbrella product throughout during  we generated growth in written premium primarily due to our connections auto product and from the appointment of new agents in several states 
during  we continued to focus on growing our commercial lines business by continuing to develop our product portfolio and specialty lines expertise in commercial lines in order to target small and first tier middle market accounts  which encompass clients whose annual premiums are generally below  through mid sized agents 
we continued to expand our business owner s policy to accommodate a broader spectrum of risks  and continued to enhance our inland marine  bond and umbrella programs  which on average are expected to offer higher margins over time and enable us to deliver a more complete product portfolio to our agents and policyholders in our target markets 
in  we experienced strong growth in both our inland marine and bond businesses  as well as growth in our more traditional products 
during  our objective is to increase the number of our partner agents and continue to achieve profitable growth in several lines of business  particularly in our inland marine  bond and other niche businesses 
our property and casualty group s earnings increased in as compared to the prior year due primarily to improved catastrophe losses in both commercial lines and personal lines 
catastrophe losses were unusually high in primarily due to hurricane katrina 
the improved earnings also resulted from increased favorable development of prior years reserves and improved current accident year results  primarily in commercial lines 
partially offsetting these improved earnings was an increase in underwriting and loss adjustment expenses 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments and increased expenses in order to  among other things  strengthen our product offerings and service capabilities  improve technology and our operating models  build expertise in our personnel and expand our distribution capabilities 
the ability to achieve profitable premium growth in and later years in order to earn adequate returns on such investments and expenses  and to grow further without proportionate increases in expenses  is key to our current strategy 

table of contents in the third quarter of  the property and casualty industry was significantly and adversely affected by the damage caused by hurricane katrina 
this catastrophe placed unprecedented demands on both the industry and hanover insurance  one of our primary property and casualty companies 
in  the estimated impact of this catastrophe  on a gross  pre tax basis was million 
the estimated impact  net of reinsurance  of this catastrophe was approximately million on a pre tax basis  or million on an after tax basis 
recent trends in claims activity observed during led us to re evaluate and increase our estimate of hurricane katrina loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves 
in  we increased our hurricane katrina gross reserves by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
our increase in this reserve  net of reinsurance  totaled million on a pre tax basis  or million on an after tax basis 
this results in an inception to date gross impact from this event of approximately million on a gross  pre tax basis 
our net of reinsurance impact from this catastrophe was approximately million on a pre tax basis  or approximately million on an after tax basis 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 
description of operating segments our business includes insurance products and services in two areas property and casualty and life companies 
within these broad areas  we have ongoing operations principally in three operating segments 
these segments are personal lines  commercial lines  and other property and casualty 
our fourth operating segment  life companies  is in run off 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the property and casualty group manages its operations principally through three segments personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
personal lines includes such property and casualty coverages as personal automobile  homeowners and other personal coverages  while commercial lines includes such property and casualty coverages as commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  workers compensation and other commercial coverages  such as bonds and inland marine business 
in addition  the other property and casualty segment consists of amgro  inc amgro  our premium financing business  opus investment management  inc opus  which markets investment management services to institutions  pension funds and other organizations  and earnings on holding company assets  as well as voluntary pools business in which we have not actively participated since as a result of the aforementioned sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business  our life companies segment consists primarily of a block of traditional life insurance products principally the closed block  our group retirement annuity contract business and our guaranteed investment contract gic business  as well as certain non insurance subsidiaries 
assets and liabilities related to our reinsured variable life insurance and annuity business  as well as our discontinued group life and health business  including group life and health voluntary pools  are also reflected in this segment 
we report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments 
corporate debt consists of our junior subordinated debentures and our senior debentures 
results of operations our consolidated net income includes the results of our four operating segments segment income  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis  and our interest expense on corporate debt 
in addition  segment income excludes certain items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations 
the income of our segments excludes items such as federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  including net gains or losses on certain derivative instruments  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe segment income enhances an investor s understanding of our results of 
table of contents operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business 
however  segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
catastrophe losses are a significant component in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our property and casualty insurance business 
however  catastrophic events  such as hurricane katrina  make it difficult to assess the underlying trends in this business 
management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to a net loss of million in the increase in of million is primarily the result of the absence in of the million loss on the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business recorded in  as well as an increase in segment results from our property and casualty business 
this improvement in property and casualty segment results primarily reflects lower after tax catastrophe losses in we experienced unusually high catastrophe losses in from hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
our consolidated net loss was million in  compared to net income of million in the decrease in of million resulted primarily from the aforementioned loss on the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business  as well as a decrease in segment results in our property and casualty business  primarily due to increased catastrophe losses from hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
net income in included the effect of the implementation of statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop  which resulted in an after tax charge of million  as well as a million favorable federal income tax settlement

table of contents segment income compared to the property and casualty group s segment income increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily due to a decrease in catastrophe related activity of million in in  we experienced significant catastrophe related activity primarily due to hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
in  we increased our catastrophe reserves for hurricane katrina by million 
segment income was also positively affected by a litigation settlement which resulted in a million benefit for excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity and the litigation settlement  our property and casualty group s segment income would have increased million for the year ended december   as compared to segment income was positively affected by an increase of million of favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves excluding hurricane katrina activity 
also  positively affecting segment income was improved current accident year underwriting results of an estimated million  primarily due to earned premium growth in our inland marine and bond lines of business and favorable loss performance in most of our commercial lines of business 
net investment income increased by million  primarily due to improved operational cash flows  and other income increased by approximately million 
these items were partially offset by increased underwriting and lae expenses of million  primarily attributable to a million increase in variable compensation costs primarily a result of improved property and casualty group segment results  a million increase in stock based compensation primarily due to the impact of the new accounting for stock based compensation in  a million increase in investments in technology and million of higher expenses in support of our inland marine and bond business 
in addition  there was a million increase in the proportion of the corporate overhead expenses assigned to the property and casualty group as a result of the disposal of the variable life insurance and annuity business in december life companies segment loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million during the same period in this improvement was primarily due to lower expenses resulting from the run off of our continuing life business and due to lower losses in our gic business 
this improvement is partially offset by the absence  in  of earnings from faflic variable products that were coinsured at december  our federal income tax expense on segment income was million in compared to an expense of million in the increase in federal income tax expense is primarily due to higher segment income in  as well as by a reduced level of tax exempt interest income 
compared to the property and casualty group s segment income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in in  we experienced significant catastrophe losses due primarily to hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
as a result  segment income was negatively impacted by million of catastrophe related activity  which includes million of reinsurance reinstatement premiums resulting from hurricane katrina  in catastrophe losses for the year ended december  were million  primarily resulting from several hurricanes in the southeast 
excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity  our property and casualty group s segment income would have increased million for the year ended december   compared to segment income was positively affected  as compared to  by an increase of million of favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves 
also positively affecting segment income in was an estimated million of improved current accident year underwriting results 
underwriting expenses decreased million in compared to  primarily due to lower contingent commissions  to lower employee related expenses and to a reduction in expenses due to a premium tax credit associated with our participation in an involuntary pool 
life companies segment loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million during the same period in this improvement of million was primarily the result of lower expenses due to the run off of our continuing life business  partially offset by a million provision related to a regulatory matter 
our federal income tax expense on segment income was million in compared to an expense of million in the change in federal income tax expense is primarily due to lower segment income in  offset  in part  by a reduced level of tax exempt interest income in 
table of contents other items in and  we recorded benefits of million and million  respectively  due to a reduction in our federal income tax reserves resulting from ongoing internal revenue service audits 
in and  we recorded income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  relating to federal income tax settlements for prior years see income taxes on pages and of this form k for further information 
net realized investment losses were million in  primarily related to million of charges resulting from impairments 
partially offsetting these losses were million of gains recognized primarily from the sale of million of fixed maturities 
also  we incurred million in partnership losses in during  net realized investment gains were million  primarily due to million of gains recognized from the sale of approximately billion of fixed maturities 
partially offsetting these gains were million of impairments  primarily related to fixed maturities  and million of losses related to the termination of certain derivative instruments 
during  net realized investment gains were million  primarily due to million of gains from the sale of million of fixed maturities 
partially offsetting these gains were losses of million related to the termination of certain derivative instruments and million of impairments primarily of fixed maturities 
gains on derivative instruments were million in as compared to losses on derivative instruments of million in and gains of million in the changes in net gains on derivative instruments in  and resulted from derivative activity that does not meet the requirements of hedge accounting 
in  and  we recognized expenses of million  million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of a restructuring effort related to our broker dealer in our life companies segment 
these restructuring costs consisted of severance and other employee related expenses  as well as the cancellation of certain lease agreements and contracted services 
additionally  in  we ceased certain employee and affinity group businesses and restructured certain commercial lines operations in our property and casualty group and recognized million in expenses related to this effort 
in  we sold our variable life insurance and annuity business see significant transactions on pages and of this form k for further information 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement no 
 we reflected the results of afliac variable life insurance and annuity business as a discontinued operation 
as such  we have restated prior year balances related to this business as discontinued operations 
we recognized income of million from the discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business in  compared to million in in  we recorded a loss of million related to the aforementioned sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business see life companies discontinued operations on pages and of this form k for a further discussion of this business 
additionally  in  we recorded losses of million  net of taxes  related to these discontinued operations 
the losses in relate to both a million increase to the existing provision for our estimated potential liability for certain contractual indemnities to goldman sachs relating to the pre sale activities of the business sold  as well as a million loss related to costs associated with the transition of this business to goldman sachs 
the additional million provision was recorded under fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this additional provision relates to preliminary estimated expenses  reimbursements  penalties and other costs of remediating certain pre closing processing errors relating to tax reporting to certain policyholders and others in connection with distributions under a subset of our former variable annuity business 
on august   we sold all of the outstanding shares of financial profiles  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  to emerging information systems incorporated and recognized a million after tax gain on the sale during the third quarter of see significant transactions on pages and of this form k 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no

table of contents positively affecting segment income was an estimated million of improved current accident year underwriting results  primarily due to favorable loss performance in both our personal and commercial lines of business

compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  in  net premiums written were negatively impacted by a reinstatement premium of million  resulting from hurricane katrina 
excluding the impact of the reinstatement premiums  personal lines net premiums written would have increased million  or  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to an increase in new business written in the personal automobile line due to the continued introduction of our product  connections auto  and to the related appointment of new agents 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business increased in compared to policies in force at the end of this increase was due to new business growth in selected states as a result of the introduction of our connections auto product and the related appointment of new agents 
this increase was partially offset by reduced exposures in massachusetts and new jersey  where the decline in policies in force is primarily due to the reduction of certain unprofitable agency relationships and certain group business that was not well aligned with our current strategy 
policies in force in the homeowners line of business decreased in  compared to policies in force at the end of  while decreasing modestly by as 
table of contents compared to september  the decrease from prior year primarily reflects declines in michigan  massachusetts and new jersey 
in michigan  policies in force declined in compared to  while decreasing by as compared to september  we attribute this decline to the slowing economy in the state  which has affected new business production 
in massachusetts  the decrease was primarily driven by our decision to exit certain unprofitable agency relationships that were not well aligned with our current strategy and  to a lesser extent  by our actions to reduce coastal exposures 
in new jersey  we exited certain group business that was also not well aligned with our current strategy 
personal lines segment income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this was primarily the result of fewer catastrophes  more favorable development of prior years loss and lae reserves and higher net investment income  partially offset by lower underwriting profit excluding prior year reserve development and the effect of catastrophes 
catastrophe related activity decreased million  from million in compared to million in  primarily due to hurricane katrina 
in addition  segment income was positively affected by an increase of million in favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves excluding hurricane katrina activity  to million in from million in investment earnings grew million in due to an increase in average invested assets  primarily due to higher operational cash flows 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  declined million  from million in to million in this decline was primarily due to higher underwriting and lae expenses of million  principally attributable to a million increase in variable compensation costs due to improved results  a million increase in stock based compensation primarily due to the impact of new accounting for stock based compensation in  a million increase in investments in technology and million of higher independent adjuster costs 
in addition  there was a million increase in the proportion of the corporate overhead expenses assigned to this segment  primarily as a result of the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business in december partially offsetting these items  our underwriting results for involuntary pools  primarily massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers car  improved million in our ability to maintain and increase personal lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results is expected to be affected by increasing price competition  our ability to achieve acceptable margins on new business written and to retain our existing business  regulatory actions  and our plans to continue to reduce coastal exposures 
for example  the massachusetts commissioner of insurance has ordered a reduction in net rates of personal automobile insurance of beginning april   which follows a reduction of in also  new business  such as that which we are generating through connections auto  generally experiences higher loss ratios than renewal business  and is more difficult to predict 
in certain states  we have experienced loss ratios with our new connections auto personal automobile business which are currently higher than expected  particularly in states in which we have less experience and data 
we have initiated several actions to improve our results in new business  however  our ability to maintain or increase earnings and continue to grow could be adversely affected should the loss ratios for new business prove to be higher than our pricing and profitability expectations 
in addition  as discussed under contingencies and regulatory matters other regulatory matters on pages and of this form k  the state of florida has taken actions which significantly affect the property and casualty insurance market in that state  including ordering rate reductions for homeowners insurance products and subjecting insurance companies that do business in the state to potentially significant assessments in the event of catastrophic losses that are insured or reinsured by state sponsored insurance or reinsurance entities 
while we have not determined our strategies in response to this action  or similar issues which may arise in other states with coastal exposures  such state actions or our responses thereto could have a significant impact on our underwriting margins and growth prospects 
commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  in  net premiums written were negatively impacted by a reinstatement premium of million  resulting from hurricane katrina 
excluding the impact of this reinstatement premium  commercial lines net premiums written would have increased million  or  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to an increase in new business driven by growth in our other commercial lines businesses  primarily inland marine and bonds  as well as growth in the commercial multiple peril line of business 
commercial lines segment income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the same period in this was primarily the result of fewer catastrophes and more 
table of contents favorable development of prior years loss and lae reserves  partially offset by lower underwriting results excluding prior year reserve development and the effect of catastrophes 
catastrophe related activity decreased million  from million in compared to million in primarily due to hurricane katrina 
in addition  segment income was positively affected by an increase in favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves excluding hurricane katrina activity of million  to million for the year ended december   from million in our underwriting loss  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  increased million in  from a profit of million in to a loss of million in this was primarily due to increased underwriting and lae expenses of million  primarily attributable to a million increase in variable compensation costs due to improved results  a million increase in investments in technology  million of higher expenses in support of our specialty lines  and a million increase in stock based compensation primarily due to the impact of the new accounting for stock based compensation in in addition  there was a million increase in the proportion of the corporate overhead expenses assigned to this segment  primarily as a result of the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business in december these items were partially offset by an estimated million of improved current accident year results primarily due to earned premium growth in our inland marine and bond lines of business and continued favorable loss trends 
we have experienced increasing competition in our commercial lines of business 
in addition  we believe the industry experienced overall rate decreases during our ability to increase commercial lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results may be affected by increased price competition 
other property and casualty segment income of the other property and casualty segment increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in segment income in includes a payment to opus in the amount of million in settlement of claims which opus alleged in a lawsuit filed in against various parties 
excluding this settlement  other property and casualty segment income would have increased million as compared to the increase is principally due to additional investment and other income in our holding company  primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business at the end of compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  the decrease in net premiums written was partially due to reinsurance reinstatement premiums of million  resulting from hurricane katrina 
excluding the impact of the reinsurance reinstatement premiums  personal lines net premiums written would have decreased million  or  for the year ended december  this was primarily the result of a decrease of million  or  in the personal automobile line and a decrease of million  or  in the homeowners line 
the decreases in the personal automobile and homeowners lines resulted primarily from and decreases in policies in force since december   respectively 
approximately three fourths of the decline in policies in force in both lines was the result of our strategies to enhance margins by reducing policies in certain less profitable portions of our business 
we reduced exposures in massachusetts  where the regulatory structure is challenging and where we conduct a significant amount of business 
we continued to exit certain unprofitable agency relationships 
we also exited certain employer and affinity group accounts that were unprofitable and not well aligned with our current strategy 
however  policies in force also declined in other markets  most significantly in michigan  where policies in force decreased in we attribute this decline partly to the introduction of an insurance score based product toward the end of that enhanced our ability to segment risks  certain service issues which management has addressed  and rate increases on specific classes of business 
personal lines segment income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  despite significant catastrophe losses due primarily to hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
this increase in segment income was primarily attributable to higher underwriting results in  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  and to more favorable development of prior years loss and lae reserves  partially offset by the impact of catastrophe related activity 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  increased million  from million in to million in this increase was principally due to a decrease in underwriting expenses of approximately million primarily from lower contingent commissions  reflecting a change in the agency commission program  from lower employee related costs and from a decrease in expenses due to a premium tax credit associated with our participation in an involuntary pool

reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  taking into account actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and policy coverage  and other factors 
we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information 
table of contents obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  our actuaries develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the actuarial estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior years claims  the trend in loss costs  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
on a quarterly basis  our actuaries provide to management a point estimate for each significant line of our direct business to summarize their analysis 
in establishing the appropriate loss reserve balances for any period  management carefully considers these actuarial point estimates  which are the principal bases for establishing our reserve balances  along with a qualitative evaluation of business trends  environmental changes  and numerous other factors 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
at december  and  total recorded reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated point reserves  respectively 
management s review of judgments and key assumptions there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims change regularly 
there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business  particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines  by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business 
in such cases  there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely 
we maintain a practice of significantly limiting the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability 
the industry has experienced adverse loss trends in these lines of business 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation and increasing medical costs in the projection of ultimate costs 
we have experienced increasing medical costs  which have moderated slightly in  including those associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan  as well as in our workers compensation line in most states 
this increase is reflected in our reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies written by us and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent 
table of contents actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 
as discussed below  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years  excluding development related to hurricane katrina  developed favorably by million  million and million for  and  respectively  which represents  and of gross loss and lae reserves held  respectively 
reserves for hurricane katrina developed unfavorably by million during the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
in  we experienced significant catastrophe losses associated with hurricane katrina and established gross loss and lae reserves of million and incurred a reinstatement premium of million 
our loss estimate for hurricane katrina was developed using closed claims data  an analysis of the claims reported to date and estimated values of properties in the affected areas 
wind speed data  flood maps and intelligence provided by on the ground staff and independent adjusters  were used to project anticipated claims and damage projections 
anticipated costs for demand surge increased costs for construction material and labor due to the increased damage resulting from the hurricane were also included in the estimate 
however  estimating losses following a major catastrophe is an inherently uncertain process  which was made more difficult by the unprecedented nature of this event  including the legal and regulatory uncertainty  difficulty in accessing portions of the affected areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  delays in claim reporting  aggravating circumstances of hurricane rita and a slower pace of recovery resulting from the extent of damage sustained in the affected areas 
in  recent trends in claims activity caused us to re evaluate and increase our estimate of hurricane katrina net loss and loss adjustment reserves by approximately million on a pre tax basis  or million  net of reinsurance  on a pre tax basis 
in commercial lines  the estimate of net losses increased primarily due to the recognition of higher business interruption exposure as more complete information was provided by insureds in response to our initiative to obtain related documentation  the impact of disputes related to wind versus water as the cause of loss  the continuation of supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages and inflationary pressures on repair costs 
in personal lines  the estimate of net losses increased by approximately million  primarily due to the continuation of supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages and inflationary pressures on repair costs 
the estimate of loss adjustment expenses also increased million  driven primarily by an increase in litigation activity leading up to the pre existing one year limit on a homeowner policyholders ability to challenge claims this period was extended to two years by legislative action and a change to the louisiana bad faith law 
we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which dispute the scope or enforceability of the flood exclusion  claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  all in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters on pages and of this form k 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 

table of contents loss and lae reserves by line of business we perform actuarial reviews on certain detailed line of business coverages 
these individual estimates are summarized into six broader lines of business personal automobile  homeowners  workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other personal and commercial lines 
the process of estimating reserves involves considerable judgment by management and is inherently uncertain 
actuarial point estimates by lines of business are the primary bases for determining ultimate expected losses and lae and the level of net reserves required  however  other factors are considered as well 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the amount of data or experience we have with respect to a particular product or geographic area  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
the table below shows our recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  and the related actuarial reserve point estimates by line of business at december  and december in millions recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate personal automobile homeowners other personal lines workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial lines asbestos and environmental pools and other total the principal factors considered by management in addition to the actuarial point estimates in determining the reserves at december  and vary by line of business 
in our commercial lines segment  management considered the growth and product mix changes in commercial lines and recent adverse severity trends in certain commercial line coverages 
in addition  management also considered the significant growth in our inland marine and bond businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate losses and the product mix change in our bond business towards a greater proportion of contract surety bonds where losses tend to emerge over a longer period of time and are cyclical related to general economic conditions 
moreover  in our commercial lines segment  management considered the likelihood of adverse development in the workers compensation line where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time and rising medical costs  while moderating in  have continued to be a concern 
in our personal lines segment  management considered the significant growth in our new business with the new connections auto product and related growth in a number of states where there is additional uncertainty in the ultimate profitability and development of reserves due to the unseasoned nature of our new business and new agency relationships in these markets 
also in personal lines  management considered the significant improvement in frequency and severity trends the industry has experienced over several years in these lines of business which were unanticipated and remain to some extent unexplained 
in  and to a lesser extent in  management considered the likelihood of future adverse development related to significant catastrophe losses experienced in regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other factors 
at december  and  total recorded reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated reserves  respectively 

table of contents the table below provides a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending gross reserve for unpaid losses and lae as follows for the years ended december in millions reserve for losses and lae  beginning of year incurred losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverable provision for insured events of current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years  favorable development hurricane katrina total incurred losses and lae payments  net of reinsurance recoverable losses and lae attributable to insured events of current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior year hurricane katrina total payments change in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses reserve for losses and lae  end of year the table below summarizes the gross reserve for losses and lae by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial total reserve for losses and lae the total reserve for losses and lae as disclosed in the above tables decreased by million in and increased by million in the decrease in was mostly a result of payments to insureds for hurricanes katrina and rita 
the increase in was mostly a result of additional direct reserves  prior to reinsurance ceded  for hurricanes katrina and rita 
prior year development by line of business when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
the table below summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina see management s review of judgements and key assumptions on pages and of this form k for a further discussion of hurricane katrina by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions decrease increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial voluntary pools decrease increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years decrease in lae provision for insured events of prior years decrease in total loss and lae provision for insured events of prior years estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million and million during and  respectively  while loss reserves for prior years developed unfavorably by million during the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower bodily injury claim frequency in the personal automobile line  primarily in the and accident years  and lower severity in the workers compensation line  primarily in the and accident years 
in addition  lower frequency of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the  and accident years and lower frequency of bodily injury claims in the commercial automobile line  primarily in the and accident years  contributed to the favorable loss development 

table of contents the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of a decrease in personal lines claim frequency and claim severity in the accident year 
in addition  the commercial multiple peril line and other commercial lines experienced lower claim severity in the most recent accident years 
partially offsetting these items was adverse development in the workers compensation line during  which was primarily the result of increased medical and long term attendant care costs 
the unfavorable loss development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of continued adverse development in the workers compensation line of business related to increased medical and long term attendant care costs 
additionally  adverse loss development was experienced in other commercial lines  primarily in umbrella and general liability  which was the result of increases in estimated ultimate losses for these long tail lines 
partially offsetting these items was favorable loss development in the commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  homeowners and personal automobile lines of business 
the improvement in loss development on these lines of business was primarily the result of improved claim frequency trends 
during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the favorable development in and is primarily attributable to the aforementioned improvement in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years which results in the decrease of ultimate loss adjustment expenses  primarily related to workers compensation and personal automobile bodily injury 
development in and was also favorably affected by claims process improvement initiatives taken by us during the to calendar year period 
although we have experienced significant favorable development in both losses and lae in recent years  there can be no assurance that this level of favorable development will occur in the future 
we believe that we will experience less favorable development in future years than we experienced in asbestos and environmental reserves although we do not specifically underwrite policies that include asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  we may be required to defend such claims 
the table below summarizes our business asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools 
for the years ended december in millions asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total beginning reserves incurred losses and lae paid losses and lae ending reserves ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the reserve for losses and lae  were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the outstanding reserves for direct business asbestos and environmental damage have remained relatively consistent for the last three years 
as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and lae incurred experience 
in addition  and not included in the numbers above  we have established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
a significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time  the business has been in runoff 
our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately million annually over the past ten years 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient 
we estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability claims  whether resulting from direct business  assumed reinsurance or pool business  
table of contents based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
nevertheless  the asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised  and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position 
reinsurance our property and casualty group maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and lae activity 
we utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses  stabilize earnings and protect capital resources  including facultative reinsurance  excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured  exposure analyses prepared by consultants and or reinsurers and on market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers financial statements  reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies  and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance intermediaries  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us  as the ceding insurer  from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow  ice storm  windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements  we ceded losses and lae of million in and million in  primarily as a result of hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
as a result of changes made to our catastrophe reinsurance program effective january   we increased our reinsurance retention related to our property catastrophe occurrence treaty from million in to million in we also did not renew our property catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty which previously provided coverage for multiple catastrophic events where retentions aggregated to million or more 
however  in the event of a significant catastrophe with losses in excess of million  we have purchased million of additional coverage as compared to although we believe that our increased retention and our decision to non renew our aggregate catastrophe treaty are appropriate given our increased level of surplus  as well as the current reinsurance pricing environment  there can be no assurance that this reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during see reinsurance in item business on pages to of this form k for further information on our reinsurance programs 
we are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to conduct certain businesses in various states  we are required to participate in residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include  among others  the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers and the michigan catastrophic claims association 
life companies on december   we sold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of afliac  a life insurance subsidiary representing approximately of our run off variable life insurance and annuity business  to goldman sachs 
the transaction also included the reinsurance of of the variable business of faflic 
in connection with these transactions  allmerica investment trust ait agreed to transfer certain assets and liabilities of its funds to certain goldman sachs variable insurance trust managed funds through a fund reorganization transaction 
finally  we agreed to sell to goldman sachs all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of allmerica financial investment management services  inc afims  an investment advisory subsidiary  concurrently with the consummation of the fund reorganization transaction 
the fund reorganization transaction was consummated on january  in connection with these agreements  faflic provided transition services to goldman sachs from the december  closing through december  see loss on sale of afliac variable life insurance and annuity business on page of this form k 

table of contents description of life companies segment our life companies segment is discussed in two major components continuing operations and discontinued operations 
our life companies continuing operations business includes the run off blocks of traditional life insurance products principally the closed block  group retirement annuity contract business  our discontinued group life and health business  including group life and health voluntary pools  gic business and certain non insurance subsidiaries 
this segment also included the faflic variable business through december  our discontinued operations represents the results of operations of the afliac variable business through its sale on december  the discontinued operations also reflects the loss we incurred on the sale of afliac  as well as the net costs incurred to provide transition services to goldman sachs  employee severance costs  indemnification costs and operations conversion expenses

other operating expenses includes interest credited to the holders of such gics of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
compared to life companies continuing operations segment loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million during the same period in this improvement was primarily due to lower expenses resulting from the run off of our continuing life business and due to lower losses in our gic business 
the improvement in was partially offset by the absence  in  of earnings from faflic variable products that were coinsured at december  compared to life companies continuing operations segment loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million during the same period in this improvement was primarily the result of lower expenses due to the run off of our continuing life business  partially offset by a million provision in related to a regulatory matter 
discontinued operations income from operations of discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business the following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated related to the discontinued operations segment  primarily consisting of the afliac variable life insurance and annuity business 
this business was sold as of december   therefore  there were no earnings during and we do not expect future results related to the operations of this business

proceeds include deferred payments of million to be received over three years 
we received million of this deferred balance on december  shareholder s equity of the afliac variable life insurance and annuity business at december   prior to the impact of the sale transaction 
a hedging program was implemented on august  to reduce the volatility in the sales price calculation from effects of equity market movements through the date of the closing 
liability for certain contractual indemnities of afliac provided under the stock purchase agreement to goldman sachs recorded under fin transaction costs include investment banker  legal  vendor contract licensing and other professional fees 
included in the proceeds from goldman sachs is the faflic variable business coinsurance ceding commission of million 
this gain was deferred and is being amortized over the remaining life of the policies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
at december   thg holding company received a tax benefit primarily due to realized losses generated by the afliac sale 
in  we recorded additional costs associated with the sale of million  net of tax 
included in this charge was an additional million provision for our estimated potential liability for certain contractual indemnities to goldman sachs relating to the pre sale activities of the business sold recorded under fin this additional provision relates to preliminary estimated expenses  reimbursements  penalties and other costs of remediating certain pre closing processing errors relating to tax reporting to certain policyholders and others for a subset of our former variable annuity business 
this estimate is based on  among other things  our review of affected policies  mathematical extrapolations derived from such review  and our preliminary view of possible settlement ranges with the internal revenue service and affected policyholders 
although we believe our fin liability for legal and regulatory matter indemnities is appropriate  including with respect to this matter  such estimates are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these estimates will not materially increase in the future 
also included in the loss for was million of costs primarily related to employee severance costs  net costs of transitional services  operations conversion expenses and other litigation matters 
we substantially completed the transition services in  therefore  we believe that we will not incur a significant amount of such expenses during gic derivative instruments compared to we use derivative instruments to hedge our gic portfolio see derivative instruments on pages and of this form k 
for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  we manage the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
in addition  some funding agreements are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  we hedge this risk by entering into foreign exchange swap contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our net foreign currency exposure 
in  approximately half of theses derivative instruments qualified for effective hedge accounting in accordance with

these hedges resulted in a million reduction in net investment income during  as compared to a million reduction in net investment income during these reductions were offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during these periods 
the decreased effect of derivative instruments in was due to a decrease in average outstanding gic deposits and associated hedges 
any ineffectiveness related to these derivative instruments is recognized in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
although we do not expect our effective hedge to become ineffective in accordance with statement no 
 there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses from ineffective hedges in the future 
compared to derivative instruments utilized to hedge our gic portfolio reduced net investment income during by million  as compared to a million reduction in these reductions were offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during these periods 
the decreased effect of derivative instruments in was due to a decline in average outstanding gic deposits and associated hedges

total investment assets decreased approximately million  or  to billion during  of which cash and cash equivalents decreased million and fixed maturities decreased million 
cash and cash equivalents  particularly in the property and casualty segment  decreased primarily as a result of our share repurchase program  as well as from payments for losses related to hurricane katrina 
fixed maturities decreased primarily due to our funding the maturity of long term funding agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by purchases of fixed maturities resulting from improved operational cash flows in our property and casualty segment 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised primarily of investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  tax exempt issues of state and local governments  us government and agency securities and other issues

other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the industrial sector  million related to the consumer cyclical sector  million related to the communication sector  million related to the consumer non cyclical sector  million related to the automotive sector  million related to the capital goods sector and million related to the energy sector 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the industrial sector  million related to the airline transportation sector  million related to the automotive sector  million related to the finance sector  million related to the communication sector  million related to the utilities sector and million related to the consumer cyclical sector 
in addition  we recognized million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of other invested assets for the year ended december   of which million is from low income housing partnerships and million is from other invested asset partnerships 
we recognized million of realized losses attributable to other than temporary impairments related to equity securities in in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  the length of time in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  and with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
we apply these factors to all securities 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which serves to reduce net income and earnings per share 
temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive income 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will  in fact  be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future 

table of contents the following table provides information about our fixed maturities and equity securities that have been continuously in an unrealized loss position 
december in millions gross unrealized losses fair value gross unrealized losses fair value investment grade fixed maturities months or less greater than months total investment grade fixed maturities below investment grade fixed maturities months or less greater than months total below investment grade fixed maturities equity securities total fixed maturities and equity securities we had million of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in gross unrealized losses of investment grade fixed maturity investments is primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates  rather than a decline in the credit quality of these investments 
the decrease in gross unrealized losses of below investment grade fixed maturity investments is primarily due to the improvement in market price levels of below investment grade credit risk in compared to and other than temporary impairment of fixed maturities during obligations of the us treasury  us government and agency securities  states and political subdivisions had associated gross unrealized losses of million at december  and million at december  at both december  and  substantially all below investment grade securities with an unrealized loss had been rated by the naic  standard poor s or moody s 
we view the gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our expectations  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  the unrealized loss would then be realized and we would record a charge to earnings 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the fair value of the underlying investment  which does reflect the unrealized loss  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period  and for equity securities at december  and actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations  with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed securities are included in the category representing their ultimate maturity 
december in millions due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total fixed maturities equity securities total fixed maturities and equity securities the carrying value of fixed maturities on non accrual status at december  and  as well as the effect that non accruals had on net investment income were not material 
although we did not experience defaults in  we expect that defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio may negatively affect investment income in future periods 
derivative instruments we maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by foreign currency  equity market and interest rate volatility 
as such  we have entered into foreign currency swap contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts  to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposure on specific funding agreement liabilities 
we also had entered into various types of interest rate swap contracts to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that were matched with fixed rate securities 

table of contents we recognized in income from continuing operations million of net realized losses on derivatives for the year ended december   million of net realized gains on derivatives for the year ended december  and million of losses for the year ended december  the realized gains during were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge the embedded gains of certain bonds identified to be liquidated to settle the maturity of a particular long term funding agreement 
the realized losses during were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge funding agreements in response to the retirement of long term funding agreements at discounts 
in may  a long term funding agreement and its associated swap contract  with a notional value of million  matured 
the remaining long term funding agreements and their associated swap contracts  with a combined million notional value  will mature in and in  and  excluding those derivatives used in the gmdb program related to our discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business  our derivative instruments primarily consisted of swap contracts 
approximately half of our remaining derivative instruments were effective hedges under statement no 
we maintained an economic hedging program involving exchange traded futures contracts to hedge against increased gmdb claims that could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  we discontinued this program on august  in response to our entering into the agreement to sell our variable life insurance and annuity business 
we recognized million in losses for the year ended december  and million in losses for the year ended december  as a result of this program 
these results are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as income from operations of discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business 
the gmdb hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting under statement no 
on august   we implemented a derivative program designed to economically hedge against fluctuations in the purchase price of the variable life insurance and annuity business 
the purchase price was determined at the time of closing and was subject to changes in interest rate  equity market  implied equity market volatility and surrender activity 
the derivatives were terminated concurrent with the sale closing on december  the derivatives in this program included exchange traded futures contracts  interest rate swap contracts and strike price call options 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses  reflected in the consolidated statements of income as loss on disposal of variable life insurance and annuity business

market risk and risk management policies interest rate sensitivity our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of our interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are paid  withdrawn  mature or re price in specified periods 
we determine the appropriate asset allocation the selection of broad investment categories such as fixed maturities  equity securities and mortgage loans by a process that focuses overall on our types of businesses and the level of surplus net worth required to support these businesses 
for our property and casualty business  we develop an investment strategy that maximizes income balanced with driving long term growth of shareholders equity and book value 
through extensive fundamental research and credit analysis  our investment professionals seek to identify a combination of undervalued securities in the credit markets and stable income producing higher quality us agency  corporate and mortgage backed securities 
for our life business  our strategy is to generate investment income while maintaining stability of investment values and preserving capital 
we believe that our approaches achieve the separate investment objectives of our property and casualty and life businesses 
as part of this approach  we develop investment guidelines for each portfolio consistent with the return objectives  risk tolerance  liquidity  time horizon  tax and regulatory requirements of the related product or business 
we have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across all portfolios 
we monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors  and in the case of mortgages  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  we currently carry long term debt 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  with indices that correlate to balance sheet instruments to modify our indicated net interest sensitivity to levels that we deem appropriate 
specifically  for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched 
table of contents with fixed rate securities  we manage the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
the following tables for the years ended december  and provide information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturities  unless otherwise noted below 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity 
available for sale securities include both us and foreign denominated fixed maturities  but exclude interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency swap contracts  which are disclosed in separate tables 
foreign denominated fixed maturities  subject to foreign currency risk  are also shown separately in the table of financial instruments subject to foreign currency risk 
for liabilities that have no contractual maturity  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates based on our historical experience  management s judgment  and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
specifically  variable rate available for sale securities and mortgage loans comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted average interest rates

additionally in  a portion of our investment securities were denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  our operating results were exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen and british pound 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates  we hedge this risk by entering into foreign exchange swaps  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our net foreign currency exposure

table of contents commodity price risk sensitivity during  we utilized futures contracts to economically hedge increased gmdb claims that could arise as a result of a decline in the equity market below certain levels 
on august   we implemented a derivative program designed to economically hedge against fluctuations in the purchase price of the variable life insurance and annuity business 
the business was sold and the derivatives were closed on december  as of december   we no longer held equity market sensitive derivatives used to economically hedge either the increased gmdb claims or the purchase price for the sale of the variable life insurance and annuity business 
income taxes we file a consolidated united states federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its domestic subsidiaries including non insurance operations 
we segregate the entities included within the consolidated group into either a life insurance or a non life insurance company subgroup 
the consolidation of these subgroups is subject to certain statutory restrictions on the percentage of eligible non life tax losses that can be applied to offset life company taxable income 
the provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations in was an expense of million  compared to a benefit of million and million during and  respectively 
these provisions resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of  and on pre tax income for  and  respectively 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from a reduction in federal income tax reserves for prior years from ongoing internal revenue service audits 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from the settlement of disputed items in our federal tax returns filed for to and a million benefit resulting from a reduction in federal income tax reserves for prior years from ongoing internal revenue service audits 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from the settlement of disputed items in our federal tax returns filed for to the largest of these disputed items relates to deductions taken for increased death benefits pertaining to certain life insurance contracts existing in and under this settlement  we received a refund of amounts paid for these years  as well as various tax credits that have been applied to offset federal tax liabilities in other years 
absent the aforementioned benefits  the effective tax rates in  and would have been  and  respectively 
the unusually low tax rate in reflects low underwriting income resulting primarily from hurricane katrina 
the rates in and result primarily from the level of underwriting income in those years  as well as a lower proportion of tax exempt interest income in we expect that at current levels of underwriting income  our federal income tax rate in future years may be marginally higher due to reduced levels of tax exempt investment income and low income housing credits 
during  our valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax asset increased slightly from million to million 
the increase in this valuation allowance resulted first from net realized losses which generated a million net deferred tax asset 
we recorded a valuation allowance for this entire amount since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be fully realized 
this valuation allowance was reflected as part of our federal income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income in additionally  our accumulated other comprehensive loss included net unrealized losses associated with our pension liability and net unrealized investment losses  together totaling million as of december  these unrealized losses resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to the unrealized losses associated with our investment portfolio  since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this asset will also not be fully realized 
we recorded this valuation allowance as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
finally  the sale of financial profiles  inc in resulted in a tax capital gain of million which produced a tax liability of million 
we decreased our valuation allowance by the million and recorded the reduction in the valuation allowance in our consolidated statements of income in the gain on sale of financial profiles  inc  a component of discontinued operations 
included in our deferred tax net asset as of december  is an asset of million related to capital loss carryforwards 
our pre tax capital losses carried forward are million  including million resulting from the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business in a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our gross capital loss carryforwards  since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be fully realized 
our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of capital loss carryforwards may change over time 
in addition  at december   we have a deferred tax asset of million  of which million relates to alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million relates to low income housing tax credit carryforwards and general business credits 
the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and the low income housing credit carryforwards will expire beginning in we may utilize the credits to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income  and 
table of contents although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable  there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included on pages to of this form k 
property casualty insurance loss reserves we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves  as discussed in segment results property and casualty  overview of loss reserve estimation process based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  our actuaries develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the actuarial estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior years claims  the trend in loss costs  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
on a quarterly basis  our actuaries provide to management a point estimate for each significant line of our direct business to summarize their analysis 
in establishing the appropriate loss reserve balances for any period  management carefully considers these actuarial point estimates  which are the principal bases for establishing our reserve balances  along with a qualitative evaluation of business trends  environmental changes  and numerous other factors 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
specific factors considered by management in determining the reserves at december  and included the current extent to which growth and product mix changes in our commercial lines segment have affected our ultimate loss trends  the significant growth in our personal lines new business and related growth in a number of states  the significant improvement in personal lines frequency and severity trends the industry has experienced over the past couple of years which were unanticipated and remain to some extent unexplained  significant growth and product mix changes in our surety bond and inland marine businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate ultimate losses and the likelihood of continued adverse development in the workers compensation line where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time and rising medical costs  while moderating in  continue to be a concern 
in  and to a lesser extent in  management also considered the likelihood of future adverse development related to significant catastrophe losses experienced in regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
at december  and  total recorded reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated reserves  respectively 
we exercise judgment in estimating all loss reserves based upon our knowledge of the property and casualty business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other factors to record an estimate which reflects our expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 

table of contents when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly see segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages and of this form k for further explanation of factors affecting our reserve estimates  our review process and our process for determining changes to our reserve estimates 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
as discussed in segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages and of this form k  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina  developed favorably by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents  and of loss reserves held  respectively 
also in  reserves for hurricane katrina developed unfavorably by million 
see also analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve development in item business on pages and of this form k  for guidance related to the annual development of our loss and lae reserves 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
in  our loss estimate for hurricane katrina was developed using an analysis of the claims reported to date and estimated values of properties in the affected areas 
wind speed data  flood maps and intelligence provided by on the ground staff and independent adjusters were used to project anticipated claims and damage projections 
anticipated costs for demand surge increased costs for construction material and labor due to the increased damage resulting from the hurricane were also included in the estimate 
however  estimating losses following a major catastrophe is an inherently uncertain process  which was made more difficult by the unprecedented nature of this event  including the legal and regulatory uncertainty  difficulty in accessing portions of the affected areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  delays in claim reporting  aggravating circumstances of hurricane rita and a slower pace of recovery resulting from the extent of damage sustained in the affected areas 
in  trends in claims activity caused us to re evaluate and increase our estimate of hurricane katrina net loss and loss adjustment reserves 
in commercial lines  the estimate of net losses increased primarily due to the recognition of higher business interruption exposure as more complete information was provided by insureds in response to our initiative to obtain related documentation  the impact of disputes related to wind versus water as the cause of loss  the continuation of supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages and inflationary pressures on repair costs 
in personal lines  the estimate of net losses increased primarily due to the continuation of supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages and inflationary pressures on repair costs 
the estimate of loss adjustment expenses also increased  driven primarily by an increase in litigation activity leading up to the pre existing one year limit on a homeowner policyholders ability to challenge claims this period was extended to two years by legislative action and a change to the louisiana bad faith law 
we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which dispute the scope or enforceability of the flood exclusion  claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  all in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters on pages and of this form k 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 

table of contents property casualty reinsurance recoverables we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to the reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
pension benefit obligations prior to  we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula 
in addition to the cash balance allocation  certain transition group employees  who had met specified age and service requirements as of december   were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment 
as of january   the defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
we account for our pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements    and r and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans  we must make various estimates and key assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
in addition  we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with this plan 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we determined our discount rate utilizing the citigroup pension discount curve as of december  as of december   based upon our plan assets in relation to this discount curve  we increased our discount rate to  from at december  to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we consider the historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
for the years ended december  and  the expected rate of return on plan assets was 
increases in actual returns on plan assets will generally reduce our net actuarial losses that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity 
as a result of an increase in the actual return on assets in  as well as demographic participant changes and a slight increase in the year end discount rate  we expect our pre tax pension expense to decrease by approximately million in from an expense of million in to a benefit of million in holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions are as follows discount rate a basis point increase in discount rate would decrease our pension expense in by million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by million and increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in by million 
significant transactions on august   we sold all of the outstanding shares of financial profiles  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  to emerging information systems incorporated 
we originally acquired financial profiles  inc in in connection with our then ongoing life insurance and annuity operations 
we received pre tax proceeds of million from the transaction and recognized an after tax gain of million 

table of contents on december   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
as of may   we completed our share repurchase program  with repurchases of million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
on december   we sold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of afliac  a life insurance subsidiary representing approximately of our run off variable life insurance and annuity business  to goldman sachs 
the transaction also included the reinsurance of of the variable business of faflic 
in connection with these transactions  ait agreed to transfer certain assets and liabilities of its funds to certain goldman sachs variable insurance trust managed funds through a fund reorganization transaction 
finally  we agreed to sell to goldman sachs all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of afims  our investment advisory subsidiary  concurrently with the consummation of the fund reorganization transaction 
the fund reorganization transaction was consummated on january  for the year ended december   we recorded a loss million  related to this sale transaction 
in connection with the sale  faflic provided transition services from the december  closing through december  costs associated with these transition services and additional costs provided for indemnification obligations to goldman sachs in connection with the sale  totaled million 
these were reflected in as a loss on disposal of variable life insurance and annuity business 
statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital rbc 
rbc ratios for regulatory purposes  as described in the glossary  are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the authorized control level the regulatory scale  however  in the insurance industry rbc ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the company action level 
set forth below are total adjusted capital  the company action level  the authorized control level and rbc ratios for faflic and hanover insurance  as of december  and december   expressed both on the industry scale total adjusted capital divided by the company action level and regulatory scale total adjusted capital divided by authorized control level in millions  except ratios total adjusted capital company action level authorized control level rbc ratio industry scale rbc ratio regulatory scale hanover insurance faflic hanover insurance s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  citizens 
faflic s total adjusted capital is reported net of the million dividend declared to the holding company in december in millions  except ratios total adjusted capital company action level authorized control level rbc ratio industry scale rbc ratio regulatory scale hanover insurance faflic hanover insurance s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  citizens 
faflic s total adjusted capital is reported net of the million dividend declared to the holding company in december 
table of contents the total adjusted statutory capital position of hanover insurance improved during  from billion at december  to billion at december  this increase is primarily due to improved underwriting results in our property and casualty business  as well as a benefit resulting from a decrease in the additional minimum pension liability associated primarily with our qualified defined benefit pension plan 
the total adjusted statutory capital position of faflic declined during  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in statutory surplus primarily resulted from the million dividend declared to the holding company in december and from losses incurred as a result of an agreement to provide transition services to goldman sachs in connection with the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business see life companies on pages to of this form k for further information 
in addition  faflic statutory surplus decreased as a result of lower underwriting results and the adoption of new statutory accounting principles 
these decreases were partially offset by the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and the recognition of tax attributes  as well as a benefit resulting from a decrease in the additional minimum pension liability associated primarily with our qualified defined benefit pension plan 
the improvement of faflic s rbc ratios reflects lower required risk based capital primarily due to lower asset and statutory reserve levels as a result of scheduled gic maturities  coinsurance  and continued business run off 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators  such as the requirement that cash dividends be paid out of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus 
as a result of this limitation  no dividends may be paid from faflic without the consent of the massachusetts commissioner of insurance 
also  the payment of extraordinary dividends  as defined  from any of our insurance subsidiaries is restricted 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with the massachusetts commissioner of insurance  upon the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business  whereby we agreed to maintain faflic s rbc ratio at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
approximately million is currently available to dividend from our property and casualty companies without prior approval from the insurance commissioners in the states of domicile

the massachusetts division of insurance approved a cash dividend from faflic of million effective december  this dividend was paid to the holding company in in  in connection with the sale of the variable life insurance and annuity business to goldman sachs  the massachusetts division of insurance approved both a cash dividend from faflic of million  including the million ceding commission related to the reinsurance of of faflic s variable life insurance and annuity business  and the distribution of other non insurance subsidiaries  from which the holding company received an additional million of funds 
these dividends were paid to the holding company in our sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums and fees collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
we periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from an increase in cash outflows for loss and lae payments primarily related to catastrophes 
also  payments to fund our qualified defined pension plan increased by million 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to lower net loss and lae payments in our property and casualty business  as well as to lower net payments from the general account as a result of fewer annuity contract surrenders  and our receipt in of a non recurring federal income tax settlement for million 
these were partially offset by lower written premiums  increased payments in for contingent commissions related to business and an increase in federal income tax payments in

this was principally comprised of million related to the sale of ait and million of the million deferred payment 
the remaining million of proceeds from goldman sachs continues to be deferred and will be received in annual installments over the next two years

based on current law  we are required to contribute million in we expect to continue to make significant cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in future years 
as the single employer of thg  the funding of these plans is the responsibility of faflic 
this contribution will not affect the statutory surplus of faflic

contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters emerald litigation on july   an action captioned american national bank and trust company of chicago  as trustee f b o emerald investments limited partnership  and emerald investments limited partnership v 
allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company emerald was commenced in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division 
in  plaintiffs purchased two variable annuity contracts with initial premiums aggregating million 
plaintiffs  who afliac subsequently identified as engaging in frequent transfers of significant sums between sub accounts that in our opinion constituted market timing  were subject to restrictions upon such trading that afliac imposed in december plaintiffs allege that such restrictions constituted a breach of the terms of the annuity contracts 
in december  the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs  holding that at least certain restrictions imposed on their trading activities violated the terms of the annuity contracts 
on may   plaintiffs filed a brief statement of damages in which  without quantifying their damage claim  they outlined a claim for i amounts totaling  for surrender charges imposed on the partial surrender by plaintiffs of the annuity contracts  ii loss of trading profits they expected over the remaining term of each annuity contract  and iii lost trading profits resulting from afliac s alleged refusal to process five specific transfers in because of trading restrictions imposed on market timers 
with respect to the lost profits  plaintiffs claim that pursuant to their trading strategy of transferring money from money market accounts to international equity accounts and back again to money market accounts  they have been able to consistently obtain relatively risk free returns of between to annually 
plaintiffs claim that they would have been able to continue to maintain such returns on the account values of their annuity contracts over the remaining terms of the annuity contracts which are based in part on the lives of the named annuitants 
the aggregate account value of plaintiffs annuities was approximately million in december on february   the court issued a ruling which precluded plaintiffs from claiming any damages accruing beyond july  a jury trial on plaintiffs damage claim was held in december  which resulted in an aggregate award to plaintiffs of million for lost profits and reimbursement of surrender charges 
plaintiffs motion for a new trial was subsequently denied 
plaintiffs currently have until march to file a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals  seventh circuit 
we will continue to vigorously defend this matter  and regard plaintiffs claims for lost trading profits as being speculative and  in any case  subject to an obligation to mitigate damages 
further  in our view  these purported lost profits would not have been earned because of various actions taken by the investment management industry and regulators  to deter or eliminate market timing  including the implementation of fair value pricing 
the monetary damages sought by plaintiffs  if awarded  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
although afliac was sold to goldman sachs on december   we have agreed to indemnify afliac and goldman sachs with respect to this litigation 
however  in our judgment  the outcome is not expected to be material to our financial position  although it could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
hurricane katrina litigation we have been named as a defendant in various litigation  including putative class actions  relating to disputes arising from damages which occurred as a result of hurricane katrina in as of december   there were in excess of such cases  six of which were styled as class actions 
these cases have been filed in both louisiana state courts and federal district courts 
these cases involve  among other claims  disputes as to the amount of reimbursable claims in particular cases  as well as the scope of insurance coverage under homeowners and commercial property policies due to flooding  civil authority actions  loss of landscaping  business interruption and other matters 
certain of these cases claim a breach of duty of good faith or violations of louisiana insurance claims handling laws or regulations and involve claims for punitive or exemplary damages 
certain of the cases claim that under louisiana s so called valued policy laws  the insurers must pay the total insured value of a home which is totally destroyed if any portion of such damage was caused by a covered peril  even if the principal cause of the loss was an excluded peril 
other cases challenge the scope or enforceability of the water damage exclusion in the policies 
several actions pending against various insurers  including thg  were consolidated for purposes of pretrial discovery and motion practice under the caption in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation  civil 
table of contents action no 
in the united states district court  eastern district of louisiana 
on november   the federal district court issued an order in these consolidated cases denying our motion to dismiss 
the court held that the flood exclusions utilized in the forms of homeowners and commercial lines policies issued by thg and a number of other insurance carriers were ambiguous because such exclusions did not specify that they applied to flooding caused by negligent acts or omissions as well as to flooding caused by natural incidents such as acts of god 
the plaintiffs in these cases claim  among other things  that the efficient proximate cause of their losses was the third party negligence of orleans levee district in the maintenance of the canal walls or in its failure to warn the plaintiffs and others of the impending water intrusion 
the federal district court ordered that discovery proceed on the questions of whether there was such negligence and whether such negligence was in fact the efficient proximate cause of such losses 
on february   the united states court of appeals  fifth circuit  issued an order granting our and the other defendant s motion for leave to appeal 
we continue to vigorously defend this matter and other cases related to losses incurred in connection with hurricane katrina 
we believe that the flood exclusions at issue are unambiguous and enforceable 
however  a final non appealable order that our flood exclusions do not exclude losses from flooding caused by third party negligence and a determination that such negligence was the efficient proximate cause of such flooding or that such an exclusion is inapplicable where any portion of a loss is attributable to a covered peril  would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position  as well as on our results of operations 
we have established our loss and loss adjustment reserves on the assumption that the flood exclusion will be found to be enforceable and effective to exclude losses caused by third party negligence  as well as by acts of god  and that the application of the valued policy law will not result in our having to pay damages for perils not otherwise covered 
other matters we have been named a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business  including one other suit which  like the emerald case described above  challenges our imposition of certain restrictions on trading funds invested in separate accounts 
in addition  we are involved  from time to time  in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies 
the potential outcome of any such action  or regulatory proceedings or other legal proceedings in which we have been named a defendant  and our ultimate liability  if any  from such action or legal proceedings  is difficult to predict at this time 
in our opinion  based on the advice of legal counsel  the ultimate resolutions of such proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position  although they could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
other regulatory matters in september  the massachusetts commissioner of insurance directed the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers to redistribute the exclusive representative producers erps amongst the state s insurance carriers  effective during on january   the commissioner of insurance approved the redistribution plan for erps and the plan was implemented on march  for all new business and may  for all renewal business 
we expect this redistribution will at least temporarily lead to a better equalization of the loss burden from the erps and is not likely to adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
in addition  recently  the massachusetts supreme judicial court unanimously affirmed the authority of the commissioner to promulgate an assigned risk plan for the residual market of personal automobile insurance 
on december   the commissioner of insurance issued an order directing the implementation of an assigned risk plan on a phased in basis beginning in april in january  the commissioner of insurance resigned and the acting commissioner issued an order suspending the implementation of the assigned risk plan until a review could be completed by the administration of the newly elected governor 
the proposed assigned risk plan would distribute the residual market based on individual policyholder assignments rather than the distribution of erps 
separately  the massachusetts division of insurance mandated a personal automobile rate decrease of for  following an decrease in legislation was enacted in louisiana to extend the time period for louisiana homeowners who have policy coverage claims arising out of hurricanes katrina and rita to take legal action against their insurance companies from the pre existing month period to months from the date of loss 
the louisiana supreme court has determined that the legislation is constitutional 
legislation was also adopted which increased an insurer s potential exposure if it is determined to have acted in bad faith in the claim adjustment process 
additionally  the state of louisiana continues to impose regulatory restrictions on our ability to reduce exposure to areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita 
in january  the governor of florida signed into law significant changes affecting the property and casualty insurance market 
the legislation reverses two 
table of contents recently approved rate increases for the residual market property insurer  citizens property insurance corporation and mandated that private insurer rates be adjusted to reflect projected savings in reinsurance costs realized through purchases of catastrophe reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund 
insurers are presently prohibited by an emergency rule from canceling  non renewing or raising rates with very limited exceptions  until rate filings reflecting the reduced cost of reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund have been filed with the office of insurance regulation 
the newly enacted restrictions also require any company which writes personal automobile business in florida to write homeowners insurance if it or any of its affiliates write homeowners in any other state 
in addition  the legislation is expected to result in a substantial increase in the size of citizens property insurance corporation  thereby increasing the potential for significant assessments or other liabilities on insurance companies in the event of catastrophic losses 
such assessments apply to property and non property lines of business and to commercial as well as to personal lines 
in the event of a significant catastrophic event  it is possible that reinsurance purchased from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund would be uncollectible or that we would be unable to recoup such assessments or assessments arising under the florida insurance guaranty association in the event of the insolvency of other insurance companies doing business in florida 
we are in the process of assessing the potential impact of these actions on our business and our potential responses thereto 
in the event citizens property insurance corporation incurred significant catastrophic losses  we could incur assessment expenses which could be material 
it is possible that any efforts we undertake to mitigate this exposure could significantly affect our premiums and profitability in florida 
over the past year other state sponsored insurers  reinsurers or involuntary pools have increased significantly  particularly those states which have atlantic or gulf coast exposures 
as a result  the potential assessment exposure of insurers doing business in such states and the attendant collection risks have increased  particularly  in our case  in the states of massachusetts  louisiana and florida 
it is possible that other states may take action similar to those taken in the state of florida 
at this time we are unable to predict the likelihood or impact of any such potential assessments or other actions 
rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
we believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security
