critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the following critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make the most significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
net operating revenue we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs and from managed care health plans 
payments for services we render to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid revenue  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce the charges to these patients to estimated cash receipts based upon the programs principles of payment reimbursement ie  either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these programs are subject to administrative review and audit and  accordingly  we periodically provide reserves for the adjustments that may ultimately result therefrom 
estimates for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based primarily on the payment terms of contractual arrangements  such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for their care 
accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net operating revenue 
the policy and practice at each of our hospitals is to write off a patient s entire account balance upon determining that the patient qualifies under a hospital s charity care and or indigent policy 
we continually monitor the levels of charity and indigent care provided by our hospitals and the procedures employed to identify and account for these patients 
in light of a recent class action lawsuit settlement that involved billings to uninsured patients see note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we began discounting our gross charges to uninsured patients for non elective procedures by forty to sixty percent in early as discussed below  we also recently changed our policy for establishing accounts receivable reserves 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the expected prospective reduction in net operating revenue from uninsured patients will be largely offset by correspondingly lower provisions for doubtful accounts 
provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage  as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of their bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the patient s specific health care or insurance plan 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as the local hospital s policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment  if any  is received from a third party  statements are sent to individual patients indicating the outstanding balance on their account 
if the account is still outstanding after a period of time  it is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the purpose of this process is to work with the patient to resolve the outstanding debt 
the primary collection agency acts  in most cases  as an extension of our local hospital business office 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect and require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in the local hospital business office 
we believe that the primary collection agencies have proven very successful in collecting the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is utilized when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off at that point as uncollectible 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if deemed necessary or appropriate  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
in many cases  patients who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their account balance 
accounts that are identified as self pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th day of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy for self pay accounts during june in order to reserve of those accounts that had aged days or more from the date of discharge prior thereto such accounts were reserved at days 
effective december  we further modified our reserve policy for self pay patients in order to reserve those accounts at when the services are rendered and  consistent with our modified reserve policies for other commercial and governmental payors  when the account ages days from the date of discharge 
these accounting policy modifications were based on  among other things  our cash collection rates and reflect increases in uninsured and underinsured patient service volume that have been experienced by us and the hospital industry as a whole 
although we believe that the current policy is appropriate and responsive to the current health care environment and the overall economic climate  we will continue to monitor these circumstances and related industry trends 
changes in payor mix  general economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could adversely affect our accounts receivable collections  cash flows and results of operations 
impairments of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the determination of possible impairment for assets to be held and used is predicated on our estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of  including discontinued operations  are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges that were material to our consolidated financial position or income from continuing operations during the calendar year  the three month period  the fiscal year or the fiscal year 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
however  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever circumstances indicate that a possible impairment might exist 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on  among other things  market conditions and operational performance 
when performing the impairment test  we initially compare the fair values of our reporting units net assets to the corresponding carrying amounts thereof on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets is less than the balance sheet carrying amount  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill  compare such fair value to the reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge 
however  there were no goodwill impairment charges to continuing operations during the calendar year  the three month period  the fiscal year or the fiscal year 
changes in the estimates used to conduct impairment tests  including revenue and profitability projections and market values  could indicate that our goodwill is impaired in future periods and result in a write off of some or all of our goodwill at that time 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 
therefore  after consideration of sfas no 
s aggregation rules  our goodwill impairment testing is performed at a divisional operating level 
goodwill is discretely allocated to our reporting units ie  each hospital s goodwill is included as a component of the aggregate reporting unit goodwill being evaluated during the impairment analysis 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recognized a long lived asset and goodwill impairment charge of million in our discontinued operations during the calendar year 
income taxes we make estimates to record the provision for income taxes  including conclusions regarding deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  as well as valuation allowances that might be required to offset deferred tax assets 
we estimate valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
when establishing valuation allowances  we consider all relevant information  including ongoing tax planning strategies 
we believe that  other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  future taxable income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and  therefore  we have not recorded any significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the year ended september  and resulted in no material audit adjustments 
our federal income tax returns for the three month period  the fiscal year and the fiscal year are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates in order to record tax reserves that adequately provide for audit adjustments  if any 
during june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
among other things  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity s financial statements 
fin requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if  as of the balance sheet reporting date  it is more likely than not ie  more than a fifty percent likelihood that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits 
when making this assessment  we must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information 
the new accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed  or expected to be claimed  on a company s income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin requires significant new and expanded footnote disclosures in all annual periods 
we are required to adopt fin with an effective date of january  implementation adjustments  if any  will be treated as a change in accounting principle and will be reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to our retained earnings on such date 
retrospective application of fin is prohibited 
due to the recent issuance of fin and the complex analyses required thereunder  we have not yet determined the impact that such accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and footnote disclosures  however  there will be no material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
professional liability claims commencing october   we began utilizing our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary that is domiciled in the cayman islands in order to self insure a greater portion of our primary professional and general liability risk 
since its inception  the captive insurance subsidiary has provided claims made coverage to all of our hospitals and certain of our employed physicians 
during the year ended september  and the fiscal year  we also procured claims made policies from independent commercial carriers in order to provide coverage for losses and loss expenses beyond the captive insurance company s policy limits 
subsequent to september   the captive insurance company provided enhanced coverage to us and  in connection therewith  it obtained claims made reinsurance policies for professional liability risks above certain retention levels 
we determine our reserves for self insured professional liability risks using asserted and unasserted claim data that has been accumulated by our incident reporting system  as well as independent third party actuarial analyses that are predicated on our historical loss payment patterns and industry trends 
we have discounted these long term liabilities to their estimated present value using discount rates of and at december  and  respectively 
we select a discount rate by estimating a risk free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the claims are projected to be paid 
the discounted reserves are periodically reviewed and adjustments thereto are recorded as more information about claim trends becomes known to us and our actuary 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our professional liability reserve requirements by approximately million 
although the ultimate settlement of these liabilities may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable and adequate 
however  if the actual claim payments and expenses exceed our projected estimates  our reserves could be materially adversely affected 
other self insured programs we provide income continuance and certain reimbursable health costs collectively workers compensation to our disabled employees and we provide health and welfare benefits to our employees  their spouses and certain beneficiaries 
such employee benefit programs are primarily self insured 
at the end of each reporting period  we record estimated liabilities for both reported and incurred but not reported workers compensation and health and welfare claims based upon historical loss experience  independent actuarial determinations and other information provided by our third party administrators 
the long term liabilities for our workers compensation program are discounted to their estimated present value using a discount rate selected by us that represents an estimated risk free interest rate corresponding to the period when such benefits are projected to be paid 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our workers compensation reserve requirements by approximately million 
we believe that the estimated liabilities for these self insured programs are adequate and reasonable but there can be no assurances that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
if the costs of these programs exceed our estimates  the liabilities could be materially adversely affected 
stock based compensation on october   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r and elected the modified prospective methodology thereunder 
as prescribed by this transitional methodology  prior periods have not been restated 
moreover  pursuant to the requirements of the modified prospective methodology  compensation expense is recognized for i all stock based awards granted or modified after september  and ii the portion of previously granted outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the sfas no 
r adoption date 
we use a black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including  among other things  our expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates  in our opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single fair value measure for our employee stock options 
we also grant deferred stock and restricted stock awards to certain key employees and outside directors on our board of directors 
the fair values of deferred stock and restricted stock awards that do not have market conditions as a prerequisite to vesting are predicated on the fair values of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
for awards with market conditions  we utilize a lattice valuation model to determine the fair values thereof 
stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally aligned with the underlying stock based award s vesting period 
for stock based arrangements with performance conditions as a prerequisite to vesting  compensation expense is not recognized until it is probable that the corresponding performance condition will be achieved 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements during september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
 which  among other things  established a framework for measuring fair value and required supplemental disclosures about such fair value measurements 
the modifications to current practice resulting from the application of this new accounting pronouncement primarily relate to the definition of fair value and the methods used to measure fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within the year of adoption 
in certain circumstances  early adoption is permissible 
we are currently evaluating when to adopt sfas no 
 however  we do not believe that the adoption of this new accounting standard will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in item on december   we operated general acute care hospitals with a total of  licensed beds in non urban communities in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  virginia  washington and west virginia 
historically  we also operated two psychiatric hospitals in florida with a total of licensed beds  however  such hospitals were sold on september  on february   we opened our newly constructed bed general acute care hospital in naples  florida 
unless specifically indicated otherwise  the following discussion excludes our discontinued operations  which are identified at note to the consolidated financial statements in item except for i a pre tax gain of approximately million in september from the disposition of the business and assets of our two psychiatric hospitals and ii a pre tax long lived asset and goodwill impairment charge of million in december  discontinued operations during the periods presented herein were not material  in the aggregate  to our consolidated results of operations 
moreover  for the periods presented herein  there is no meaningful distinction between our consolidated results from continuing operations and disaggregated segment reporting amounts see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item as a result of our change in fiscal year end from september to december  the first full fiscal year affected by this change is the calendar year 
in order to provide meaningful financial and other comparative operational analyses  we included herein unaudited consolidated financial information for the year ended december  the calendar year 
such unaudited financial information was derived from our unaudited results of operations during the last nine months of the fiscal year and the audited three month period 
during the calendar year  we experienced net operating revenue growth over the calendar year of approximately that resulted from the inclusion of revenue from hospitals we acquired after december   favorable case mix trends and improvements in reimbursement rates 
income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by approximately and  respectively  during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
offsetting the increase in net operating revenue during the calendar year and ultimately causing a year over year reduction in income from continuing operations  were a significant increase in the provision for doubtful accounts discussed below  incremental costs pertaining to a new accounting pronouncement for stock based compensation and higher interest costs 
also  adversely impacting income from continuing operations during the calendar year were increased payroll costs for newly hired physician employees  utilities  professional fees primarily related to non employed temporary physicians and physician on call charges  property taxes and insurance 
at our hospitals that were in operation during all of the calendar year and the calendar year  which we refer to as the same hospitals  surgeries increased by approximately  however  same hospital admissions and emergency room visits experienced corresponding declines of and  respectively 
despite these declines  we believe that our adherence to the acquisition criteria we have strictly followed for many years  whereby we acquire hospitals in growing non urban areas and in areas where we believe the opportunity exists to reverse outmigration to other hospitals  will be successful 
furthermore  our hospitals continue to add physicians to their medical staffs and medical equipment to their hospitals in order to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
we believe that  over time  these investments  coupled with improving demographics  will yield increased hospital surgeries  emergency room visits and admissions 
outpatient services continue to play an important role in the delivery of health care in our markets  with approximately half of our net operating revenue during the calendar year and the calendar year generated on an outpatient basis 
we continue to improve our emergency room and diagnostic imaging services to meet the needs of the communities we serve and have invested capital in nearly every one of our hospitals during the last five years in one of these two areas 
notwithstanding this continuous operational focus  our same hospital adjusted admissions  which adjusts admissions for outpatient volume  declined by approximately during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
economic conditions and changes in commercial health insurance benefit plans over the past several years have contributed to an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking health care in the united states 
this general industry trend has affected us  with our self pay same hospital admissions as a percent of total admissions increasing to approximately during the calendar year  as compared to during the calendar year 
moreover  self pay admissions at our same hospitals as a percent of total admissions were during the three months ended december  we continually evaluate our policies and programs in light of these trends and other information available to us and consider changes or modifications to our policies as circumstances warrant 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year increased to approximately of net operating revenue from of net operating revenue during the calendar year 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  during both the calendar year and the calendar year we modified our provision for doubtful accounts policy for  among others  self pay accounts receivable  resulting in the recognition of additional expenses of approximately million and million  respectively 
such policy modifications contributed approximately basis points and basis points to the calendar year and calendar year percentages  respectively 
excluding the impact of such accounting policy modifications  there was an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenue 
such increase was a further indicator of the increased prevalence of uninsured and underinsured patients in the mix of the patients we serve 
despite these changes  we believe that our provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenue has historically been lower than our industry peer group average because our historical charity and indigent care policies have resulted in a higher percent of uninsured patient accounts being treated as foregone unrecognized revenue rather than as a component of the provision for doubtful accounts 
however  as we have more recently attempted to pursue collection of amounts due from uninsured patient accounts that are at a higher multiple of the federal poverty level guidelines  such accounts are now more likely to remain in our accounts receivable for a longer period of time and be reserved in our provision for doubtful accounts 
calendar year compared to the calendar year the tables below summarize our operating results for the calendar year and the calendar year

this change represented an increase of million or 
same hospitals provided approximately million  or  of the increase in net operating revenue as a result of increases in surgeries and reimbursement rates and favorable case mix trends 
the remaining million increase in net operating revenue was primarily attributable to hospitals we acquired after december  net operating revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
contributing factors to such change included increased patient acuity and improvements in medicare and medicaid pricing  as well as the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial providers 
accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net operating revenue 
foregone charges for charity and indigent care write offs were approximately million or of total patient charges during the calendar year and million or of total patient charges during the calendar year 
we believe that our decentralized management strategy  including maintaining local business office operations in each of our hospitals  significantly contributes to billing accuracy and effective accounts receivable management 
our hospitals also work diligently to help uninsured patients qualify for medicaid and other state and local financial assistance programs 
salaries and benefits as a percent of net operating revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
this increase was partially attributable to i the incremental impact of stock based compensation ie  an increase of approximately million in the calendar year over the calendar year and ii an increase in total employed physicians that primarily resulted from our may  acquisition of cleveland clinic naples hospital now known as physicians regional medical center pine ridge see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
same hospital salaries and benefits  exclusive of the impact of stock based compensation  were and of net operating revenue during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
this increase was a result of our strategic initiatives to i hire more primary care physicians and family practitioners to improve and enhance referral patterns and ii employ physicians on a short term basis in order to facilitate their entry into markets where our hospitals operate 
supplies decreased as a percent of net operating revenue to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
this decrease was due to the implementation of certain strategic sourcing agreements in high cost areas such as cardiovascular devices and increased utilization of our group purchasing organization  which resulted in increased rebates and discounts 
other operating costs as a percent of net operating revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
in addition to increased costs for utilities  professional fees  property taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance during the calendar year  the percent increase was due to higher costs at hospitals we acquired after december  during the calendar year  we recognized approximately million of gains on sales of i a medical office building and land in jackson  mississippi and ii two home health agencies 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  we also recorded insurance claim recovery gains for renovations and equipment approximating million and million  respectively 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item interest expense increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such change was attributable to i an increased weighted average revolving credit agreement outstanding balance during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year  ii higher effective interest rates during the calendar year and iii the non put payments described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  which became effective on august   under our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
borrowings under our revolving credit agreement during the calendar year resulted from acquisition activity and certain required income tax payments 
the repurchase of certain of our exchange zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due the new notes on january  caused our interest expense to increase by approximately million during the calendar year because the effective annual interest rate on the new notes ie  is substantially less than the effective interest rate on our senior notes due additionally  the note non put payments caused interest expense to increase by approximately million during the calendar year 
see liquidity capital resources  credit facilities below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item in light of the recapitalization of our balance sheet  which is described at note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we anticipate that our interest expense during the year ending december  will be approximately million to million 
in connection with our repurchase of certain of the new notes on january  and the execution of the third supplemental indenture to the notes  we wrote off approximately million of deferred financing costs and incurred approximately million of non capitalizable debt restructuring costs 
such amounts  which were recorded as refinancing and debt modification costs  adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately during the calendar year 
our effective income tax rates were approximately and during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item regarding the calendar year effective rate

this change represented an increase of million or 
our hospitals that were in operation during all of the fiscal year and the fiscal year  which we refer to as our same hospitals  provided approximately million  or  of the increase in net operating revenue as a result of i increases in surgeries  admissions  emergency room visits and reimbursement rates  ii favorable case mix trends and iii approximately million more business interruption insurance revenue in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the remaining million increase in net operating revenue was primarily attributable to hospitals we acquired after september  net operating revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased approximately during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year 
contributing factors to such change included improvements in medicare pricing and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial providers 
accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net operating revenue 
foregone charges for charity and indigent care write offs were approximately million or of total patient charges during the fiscal year and million or of total patient charges during the fiscal year 
our provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenue was approximately during the fiscal year  which represents a basis point increase over the fiscal year 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  during the fiscal year our provision for doubtful accounts policy modification for self pay accounts receivable resulted in the recognition of additional expense of approximately million during such period  thereby contributing approximately basis points to the fiscal year percent 
therefore  after excluding the impact of such accounting policy modification  there was effectively no change in the fiscal year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenue 
salaries and benefits were of net operating revenue during both the fiscal year and the fiscal year 
additionally  same hospital salaries and benefits were and of net operating revenue during the fiscal year and the fiscal year  respectively 
these financial ratios reflect our ability to adjust salary and benefit cost levels to accommodate patient volume and acuity trends 
supplies increased as a percent of net operating revenue to during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year 
the majority of this increase was due to higher costs at hospitals we acquired after september  and increased supply costs for certain surgical procedures eg  orthopedic implants  drug eluting stents  etc 
that demonstrated significant volume increases during the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year  we recognized approximately million of gains on sales of i a medical office building and land in jackson  mississippi and ii two home health agencies 
additionally  during such period we also recorded insurance claim recovery gains for renovations and equipment approximating million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item our effective income tax rates were approximately and during the fiscal year and the fiscal year  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures liquidity our cash flows from continuing operating activities provide the primary source of cash for our ongoing business needs 
below is a summary of our recent cash flow activity in thousands 
years ended december  years ended september  sources uses of cash and cash equivalents operating activities     investing activities     financing activities     discontinued operations    cumulative effect adjustment  net decrease in cash and cash equivalents   this adjustment is described at note to the consolidated financial statements in item calendar year cash flows compared to the calendar year cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities decreased approximately million or during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
despite lower net income and substantial growth in accounts receivable during the calendar year  we believe that efficient management of our other operating assets and liabilities led to stable cash flows from continuing operating activities during such period 
substantially all of the growth in accounts receivable during both the calendar year and the calendar year were attributable to our corresponding acquisition activity 
business interruption insurance proceeds of approximately million and million were included in cash flows from continuing operating activities during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
such amounts have generally been utilized to make minor repairs and fund remediation efforts at the hospitals impacted by hurricane and storm activity 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the calendar year consisted primarily of i million that was paid for hospitals we acquired with effective acquisition dates of february   may  and june   ii a final working capital settlement payment of approximately million pertaining to a hospital acquisition from a prior period  iii million for additions to property  plant and equipment  which primarily consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities  new hospital construction and capital expenditures for hospital replacement projects  and iv a net increase in restricted funds of million 
during the calendar year  the disposition of two psychiatric hospitals and certain real property in lakeland  florida yielded approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations that were recognized as cash flows from investing activities 
cash receipts of approximately million from sales of assets principally property  plant and equipment and insurance recoveries were also realized during the calendar year 
during the calendar year  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of i million paid for three hospitals we acquired in february  individual hospitals we acquired in april and december and the hospital we acquired with an effective date of january  and ii million for additions to property  plant and equipment  which primarily consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with two hospital replacement projects 
offsetting these cash outlays were cash receipts of approximately million from sales of assets and insurance recoveries and a net decrease in restricted funds of million 
insurance proceeds have generally been utilized for major repairs and property  plant and equipment replacement at the hospitals impacted by hurricane and storm activity 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities during the calendar year included i borrowings of million under our revolving credit agreement in order to finance our hospital acquisitions  certain income tax payments and our repurchase of a portion of the new notes  ii net proceeds from the april  sale of million of our senior notes due and iii proceeds from exercises of stock options of approximately million 
as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  during the calendar year we i repurchased approximately million of the new notes on january   which represented the accreted value of such notes on that date  and ii utilized the net proceeds from the sale of our senior notes to repay a portion of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit agreement

see note to the consolidated financial statements in item fiscal year cash flows compared to the fiscal year cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities increased million or during the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
enhanced profitability  as well as improved asset and liability management  led to the increased cash flows from continuing operating activities during the fiscal year 
uses of cash attributable to accounts receivable in the fiscal year and the fiscal year were approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in an increase to net cash flows from continuing operating activities of million in the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year 
in both years  acquisitions accounted for the majority of the increases in accounts receivable 
increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities contributed approximately million to the fiscal year increase in cash flows from continuing operating activities when compared to the fiscal year 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year consisted primarily of i approximately million  in the aggregate  for the hospital we acquired in october  the three hospitals we acquired in february and the hospital we acquired in april  ii million for additions to property  plant and equipment  which primarily consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities  new hospital construction and capital expenditures for two hospital replacement projects  and iii a net increase in restricted funds of million 
offsetting these cash outlays were cash receipts of approximately million from sales of assets and insurance recoveries 
insurance proceeds have generally been utilized for major repairs and property  plant and equipment replacement at the hospitals impacted by hurricane and storm activity 
during the fiscal year  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of million paid for the five hospitals we acquired in november  million for additions to property  plant and equipment and a net increase in restricted funds of million

additionally  during such period  we used million of cash to collateralize a standby letter of credit 
cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year included borrowings of million under our prior revolving credit agreement for the acquisition of five hospitals in november  however  we subsequently repaid such debt with cash provided by continuing operating activities during the same fiscal year 
proceeds from exercises of stock options provided an additional million during the fiscal year 
payments of dividends in the fiscal year represented a million use of cash during such period 
discontinued operations the cash provided by operating our discontinued operations during the fiscal year and the fiscal year was approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not believe that the eventual exclusion of such amounts from our consolidated cash flows in future periods will have a material effect on our liquidity or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item days sales outstanding dso at the beginning of each fiscal year  we announce a number of financial and quality objectives for the coming fiscal year  including days sales outstanding  or dso 
our dso is calculated by dividing quarterly net operating revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain our dso 
we believe that this statistic is an important measure of collections on our accounts receivable 
our dso at december  was days  which compares to days at december  and our published dso objective range of days to days 
however  as a result of the calendar year accounting policy change regarding the provision for doubtful accounts for self pay accounts  our dso at december  was reduced by approximately days 
after excluding of the effect of such change in accounting policy  the nominal increase in our dso from december  to december  was primarily due to billing delays at our most recently acquired hospitals 
we believe that virtually no accounts receivable identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing that are aged less than days past date of discharge will convert to self pay 
however  as such accounts age  a small percentage of those accounts may convert to self pay upon denials from third party payors 
those accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for potential denial and are reclassified as appropriate 
the approximate percent of total gross billed accounts receivable  summarized by aging category and including discontinued operations  is as follows december  december  days days days and over days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals in addition to dso  we utilize other factors to analyze the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in that regard  we compare subsequent cash collections to net accounts receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  and review the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percent of gross accounts receivable 
these and other factors are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for developing trends in our accounts receivable portfolio 
effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to ongoing changes as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
although we believe that these changes will continue to limit reimbursement increases under these programs  we do not believe that these changes will have a material adverse effect on our future revenue or liquidity 
nevertheless  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  numerous areas are subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that could affect payments made to us under those programs 
in the future  federal and or state governments might reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care services in the united states and or the continued prevalence of managed care programs could have an adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources credit facilities new senior secured credit facilities on january   we announced a recapitalization of our balance sheet hereinafter referred to as the recapitalization

the new credit facilities  which will be secured by a substantial portion of our real property and other assets and will be guaranteed as to payment by our subsidiaries other than certain exempted subsidiaries  consist of a seven year billion term loan and a million six year revolving credit facility 
the collateral for the new credit facilities will also secure our senior notes due  which are discussed below  on a pari passu basis 
our new term loan requires principal payments to amortize of the loan s original face value during each of the first six years of the loan s term and a balloon payment for the remaining outstanding balance will be due in the final year of the agreement 
our new revolving credit facility allows us to borrow up to million including standby letters of credit 
during the new revolving credit facility s six year term  we will be obligated to pay commitment fees based upon the amounts available for borrowing

we can elect whether interest  which is generally payable monthly in arrears  is based on i the libor rate or ii the higher of the prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the effective interest rate includes a spread above our selected base rate and is subject to modification in the event that our debt ratings change 
additionally  we may elect differing base interest rates for the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility 
however  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying agreements  we will maintain interest rate swap contracts or other hedging contracts covering at least of the outstanding borrowings 
such contracts must provide for i effective payment of interest on a fixed rate basis or ii fixed interest rates for a period of at least three years 
as of february   our effective interest rate on the new credit facilities was approximately  however  at such date  there were no amounts outstanding thereunder 
the agreements underlying the new credit facilities contain covenants that  without prior consent of the lenders  limit certain of our activities  including those relating to mergers  consolidations  our ability to secure additional indebtedness  sales  transfers and other dispositions of property and assets  capital expenditures  providing new guarantees  investing in joint ventures  and granting additional security interests

additionally  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the new credit facilities  limitations are imposed on us regarding the manner in which we can redeem some or all of the notes as described below 
should we use future proceeds from the new credit facilities for such redemption  we must meet certain financial ratios and  in some circumstances  maintain a specified minimum availability under our new revolving credit facility 
if we elect to borrow funds other than under the new credit facilities or issue equity securities in order to fund a redemption of some or all of the notes  we will be subject to separate requirements  including  among other things  a requirement that we maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
furthermore  as set forth under the new credit facilities  such additional borrowed funds must be in the form of either permitted subordinated indebtedness or permitted senior unsecured indebtedness 
in addition to the annual principal payments of million on the new term loan  we anticipate that the incremental interest payments under the new credit facilities during the first year of its term will range from approximately million to million 
we intend to fund such required principal and interest payments with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
million revolving credit agreement the existing credit agreement on may   we entered into the existing credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
as part of the recapitalization  the existing credit agreement will be terminated on february  and the outstanding balance thereunder will be satisfied with proceeds from the new credit facilities 
the existing credit agreement  as amended  allowed us to borrow  on an unsecured basis  up to million including standby letters of credit

at both february  and december   we had million outstanding under the existing credit agreement 
promissory demand note on august   we executed a million unsecured demand promissory note in favor of a bank  which is to be used as a working capital line of credit in conjunction with our cash management program

absent such a demand  interest is payable monthly and determined using the libor market index rate  as that term is defined in the demand promissory note  plus 
the demand promissory note s effective interest rate on december  was approximately  however  there were no amounts outstanding thereunder on such date 
senior debt securities senior notes due the senior notes as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  on april  we completed an underwritten public offering of million of our senior notes 
such notes  which rank equally in priority with the existing credit agreement  were initially unsecured obligations 
however  as a result of the recapitalization  the senior notes will be secured pari passu with the new credit facilities and such notes will be guaranteed as to payment by our subsidiaries other than certain exempted subsidiaries 
the senior notes are expressly senior in right of payment to our convertible senior subordinated notes due  exchange zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due and zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due the sale of the senior notes resulted in our receipt of net proceeds approximating million  which we utilized to repay a portion of the balance outstanding under the existing credit agreement 
the senior notes mature on april  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october we intend to fund our semi annual interest payments with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  amounts available under the new credit facilities 
convertible debt securities exchange zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due the new notes on january  and january   the holders of approximately million and million  respectively  in principal face value new notes exercised their contractual rights to require us to repurchase their notes 
as a result  we were obligated to repurchase such new notes at their accreted values of approximately million and million  respectively 
the holders of  in principal face value new notes did not require us to repurchase their notes and  accordingly  such notes remain outstanding 
we financed the million new note repurchase with borrowings under the existing credit agreement 
the latter new note repurchase was financed with cash on hand 
convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes at december   approximately million was outstanding under the notes 
the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase such notes for their principal face value on august  following the announcement of the recapitalization  our credit ratings were downgraded and  accordingly  a triggering event under the notes caused such notes to become immediately convertible 
as of february   no holders of the notes have indicated to us an intent to convert their notes 
however  should some or all of the notes be converted before august   we intend to fund such conversion with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of our cash requirements upon a conversion of the notes 
as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified the indenture that governs the notes on june  such modification requires us to make additional cash payments non put payments to the noteholders equal to per annum of the principal face amount of their outstanding notes 
inclusive of the per annum interest provided in the original indenture  the noteholders will receive total annual payments of of the principal face amount of their outstanding notes 
the non put payments will be made semi annually along with the recurring interest payments  in arrears  on february and august of each year 
we intend to fund our semi annual interest payments and non put payments under the notes with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  amounts available under the new credit facilities 
dividends and stock repurchase program during the calendar year  we paid aggregate cash dividends of per common share  or approximately million 
additionally  on january  we announced that our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregate payment of approximately billion  payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  who continue to hold their shares on march  this special cash dividend is part of the recapitalization and will be funded with the proceeds from our new credit facilities 
in light of the special cash dividend  we have indefinitely suspended all future dividend payments 
on june   we announced that our board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
through february   we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under this program in the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
this common stock repurchase program will remain in effect  however  in light of the recapitalization  our board of directors does not anticipate additional common stock repurchases unless there exists a significant undervaluation of our common stock in the marketplace 
our dividend payments and common stock repurchases were funded with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the existing credit agreement 
see market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in item standby letters of credit at december   we maintained approximately million of standby letters of credit in favor of third parties with various expiration dates through october  should any or all of these letters of credit be drawn upon  we intend to satisfy such obligations with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  amounts available under the new credit facilities 
capital expenditures among other things  our long term business strategy calls for us to acquire additional hospitals that meet our acquisition criteria 
historically  acquisitions of hospitals accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures in any given fiscal year and or quarter 
we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospitals and other ongoing capital expenditure requirements with available cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  amounts available under revolving credit agreements and proceeds from long term debt issuances  or a combination thereof 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for discussion of our recently completed acquisitions 
a number of hospital renovation and or expansion projects were underway at december  we do not believe that any of these projects are individually significant or that they represent  in the aggregate  a substantial commitment of our resources 
we completed construction of our replacement hospital in carlisle  pennsylvania in january and our de novo general acute care hospital bed physicians regional medical center collier boulevard in naples  florida in early additionally  we are contractually obligated to commence construction of a replacement hospital at our monroe  georgia location on or before september  the aggregate cost for such project has not yet been determined but the underlying land parcel was acquired for cash in march hospital divestitures as more fully discussed at note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we entered into a definitive agreement to divest three general acute care hospitals and certain affiliated entities 
subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions customary to closing  we anticipate that two of such hospitals will be divested during the first half of  including one through a sublease arrangement with a third party 
while we still intend to sell the third hospital  the timing of such disposition is to be determined 
we expect to utilize the net proceeds from these divestitures for general corporate purposes 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth in the table below  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   contractual obligations for each of the next five years ending december and thereafter including principal and interest and other commitments are summarized in the table below 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  the recapitalization will have a significant impact on our debt structure 
interest rates at december  were used in the table to estimate interest payments on variable rate debt 
payments due by year ending december  contractual obligations thereafter in thousands long term debt  excluding the revolving credit agreement a     revolving credit agreement b  capital leases       operating leases c       physician commitments d  total contractual obligations     other commitments not recorded on the consolidated commitment expiration by year ending december  balance sheet thereafter in thousands letters of credit e  physician commitments d  other f total commitments  a on january   certain holders of the notes and the new notes as such debt securities are defined at note to the consolidated financial statement in item exercised their contractual rights to require us to repurchase approximately million of their principal face value notes at their accreted value of approximately million 
the holders of  in principal face value notes did not require us to repurchase their notes 
for purposes of the above table  we assumed that we would repurchase all of the notes as such debt securities are defined at note to the consolidated financial statement in item on august  because the noteholders can unilaterally exercise their contractual rights to require us to repurchase some or all of their notes on such date 
b as part of the recapitalization  we will terminate the existing credit agreement on february  and the outstanding balance thereunder will be satisfied with the proceeds from new long term borrowings 
c obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near our hospitals for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings to third parties 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
d see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item for discussion of certain physician and physician group guarantees and commitments 
e amounts primarily relate to outstanding letters of credit with financial institutions 
the letters of credit principally serve as security for our workers compensation self insurance program  construction vendors and utility companies 
f other primarily includes our new hospital construction in naples  florida but excludes our monroe  georgia construction project because the cost thereof has not yet been determined 
impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volume and net operating revenue in the first and second quarters of each calendar year because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which in turn results in significant increases in the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and is subject to wage and related employee benefit expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when shortages of skilled labor occur 
there is an ongoing shortage of skilled nursing staff throughout the health care industry  which has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed the nursing staff needs in our markets by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  suppliers  utility companies and other vendors pass on rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we believe that we have been able to offset increases in our operating costs by increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases through our group purchasing agreement and by efficiently utilizing our resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs  we cannot predict our ability to recover or offset future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates at december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of the variable rate existing credit agreement 
however  interest rates on substantially all of our other long term debt at december  were fixed and  accordingly  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on us but increases in interest rates would correspondingly increase interest expense associated with our future borrowings 
as of december   we did not use derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of our debt 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  the recapitalization will have a significant impact on our debt structure and  among other things  requires us to use certain derivative financial instruments in connection with our new variable rate borrowings 
at december   the fair value and carrying amount of our fixed rate debt  including capital lease obligations  were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
additionally  at such date  both the fair value and carrying amount of our variable rate debt was approximately million 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  the fair values of our fixed rate debt changed after the announcement of the recapitalization 
in light of the recapitalization and our repurchase of certain notes and new notes in january  the table below summarizes principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of our outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations that existed at december  years ending december  thereafter totals in thousands long term debt fixed rate long term debt  including capital leases     weighted average interest rates fixed rate convertible long term debt  a  b weighted average interest rates variable rate long term debt  c  weighted average interest rates a on january   certain holders of the notes and the new notes exercised their contractual rights to require us to repurchase approximately million of their principal face value notes at their accreted value of approximately million 
the holders of  in principal face value notes did not require us to repurchase their notes 
b for purposes of the above table  we assumed that we would repurchase all of the notes on august  because the noteholders can unilaterally exercise their contractual rights to require us to repurchase some or all of their notes on such date 
c as part of the recapitalization  we will terminate the existing credit agreement on february  and the outstanding balance thereunder million at december  will be satisfied with the proceeds from new long term borrowings 
the interest rate on the existing credit agreement is the libor rate plus 
the effective interest rate on the outstanding balance at december  was approximately
