item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as of february   we operated casual dining restaurants featuring on premises breweries under the name granite city food brewery 
using the proceeds from the sale of our securities  debt and equipment financing and cash flow from operations  we intend to finance our working capital needs and expand our restaurant chain into markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
we believe that our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  changes in food and labor costs  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  the skill and experience of our restaurant level management teams and weather conditions 
we expect the timing of new restaurant openings to have a significant impact on restaurant revenues and costs 
we believe we will incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a new restaurant within the two months immediately preceding  and the month of  the opening of such restaurant 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the last tuesday of december to account for our operations 
all references to   and within the following discussion represent fiscal years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
our fiscal year ended december  included restaurant weeks 
our fiscal year ended december  included restaurant weeks 
our fiscal year ended december  included restaurant weeks  which is the sum of the actual number of weeks each restaurant operated 
weeks of operations at each of our restaurants for fiscal year   and are shown in the following chart location fiscal weeks of operation fiscal weeks of operation fiscal weeks of operation st

louis park  minnesota omaha  nebraska roseville  minnesota madison  wisconsin total restaurant weeks because we continue to expand our operations and open new restaurants at various times throughout the year  we provide the statistical measure of restaurant weeks to enhance the comparison of revenues from period to period as changes occur in the number of units we are operating 
our restaurant revenues are comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
the sale of retail items  such as cigarettes and promotional items  typically represents less than one percent of total revenue 
product costs include the costs of food  beverages and retail items 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the salaries and related costs of our dedicated new store opening team  and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations which include management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  market research  professional fees  supplies and corporate rent 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures at the restaurant and corporate levels and amortization of intangibles that do not have indefinite lives 
other income and expense represents the cost of interest expense on debt and capital leases  interest income on invested assets and loss on disposal of assets

critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of our financial statements property and equipment the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to years 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the initial term of the related lease  which is generally years 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes 
amortization of assets acquired under capital lease is included in depreciation expense 
we review property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
we base this assessment upon the carrying value versus the fair market value of the asset and whether or not that difference is recoverable 
such assessment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis and includes other relevant facts and circumstances including the physical condition of the asset 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates we have made 
leasing activities we have entered into various leases for our buildings  equipment and for ground leases 
at the inception of a lease  we evaluate it to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease pursuant to sfas no 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurants sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease which can impact the classification and account for a lease as capital or operating 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  rent expense and interest expense than would be reported if different assumptions were made 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under such provisions  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
under the black scholes option pricing model  we determine the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date 
this requires judgment  including but not limited to the expected volatility of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of prepared food and beverage and select retail items and is recognized at the time of sale 
revenue derived from gift card sales is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  the outstanding balances on such cards are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize gift card breakage amounts based upon historical redemption patterns  which represent the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
we arrive at this amount using certain management judgments and estimates 
such judgments and estimates may produce different amounts of breakage than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues we generated  and  of revenues during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in revenues of for over was primarily the result of the additional restaurant operating weeks related to the seven new restaurants that opened in fiscal year included restaurant operating weeks  which is the sum of the actual number of weeks each restaurant operated  while fiscal included operating weeks 
comparable restaurant revenues  which include restaurants in operation over months  increased for the increase in comparable restaurant revenues was primarily driven by an increase in guest traffic 
a price increase that took effect at the end of november also contributed to the increase in revenues and comparable restaurant revenues 
average weekly revenues increased from  per week in to  per week in for all the restaurants in operation during the year 
average weekly revenues for comparable restaurants were  for fiscal as compared to  in the prior year 
we anticipate that restaurant revenues will vary from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate seasonal fluctuations in restaurant revenues due in part to increased outdoor seating and generally favorable weather conditions at our locations during the summer months 
due to the honeymoon effect that periodically occurs when some of our restaurants open  we expect the timing of new restaurant openings to cause fluctuations in restaurant revenues 
additionally  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in consumer preferences may affect our future revenues 
restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in the decrease was due primarily to more experienced staff members generating less waste  as well as lower per unit product prices due to continued higher volume company wide purchasing 
we expect that our food and beverage costs will vary going forward due to numerous variables  including seasonal changes in food and beverage costs  and guest preferences 
we periodically create new menu offerings and introduce new craft brewed beers based upon guest preferences 
although such menu modifications may temporarily result in increased food and beverage cost  we believe we are able to offset such increases with our weekly specials which provide variety and value to our guests 
our varieties of craft brewed beer  which we believe we can produce at lower cost than beers we purchase for resale  also enable us to keep our food and beverage costs low while fulfilling guest requests and building customer loyalty 
as we open additional units  we believe we will experience increased purchasing power  partially offsetting food and beverage cost increases  and maintain or reduce our food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue 
additionally  as we add new units  we believe our brewing process  fermentus interruptus  will allow us to keep our high quality beer products intact while leveraging our fixed production costs  thereby enhancing overall profitability 
labor labor expenses consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items and partner and management bonuses 
our experience to date has been that staff labor costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
our labor costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in primarily due to improvement in managing our labor costs along with a favorable trend in our workers compensation insurance costs 
we expect that labor costs will vary as we add new restaurants 
minimum wage laws  local labor laws and practices  as well as unemployment rates vary from state to state and will affect our labor costs  as will hiring and training expenses at our new units 
we believe that retaining good employees and more experienced staff ensures high quality guest service and reduces hiring and training costs 
direct operating and occupancy expenses direct operating expenses consist primarily of various restaurant level costs  a substantial portion which is fixed or indirectly variable and are expected to fluctuate with revenues 
operating supplies  repairs and maintenance expenses  utility costs  promotion expenses and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct operating expenses 
our experience to date has been that operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
our direct operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased during to from for the decrease was attributable to lower use of take out paper and packaging supplies  lower utility costs  and lower repair and maintenance expenses 
occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes 
occupancy costs  as a percentage of revenues  increased during to from for this increase was due primarily to increases in rent and property taxes 
pre opening costs pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the wages and expenses of our dedicated new store opening team and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
pre opening costs during represented costs of opening seven new restaurants 
the pre opening costs in represented the costs of opening four new restaurants 
beginning in fiscal year  we included rental costs incurred during construction periods in pre opening costs in accordance with fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp fas 
based upon the costs of labor  travel  lodging  training and rent incurred prior to opening  we expect pre opening costs to average between  and  per unit  of which we anticipate approximately  to  to be construction period rent 
pre opening costs  excluding construction period rent  are primarily incurred in the month of  and two months prior to  restaurant opening 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include all salaries and benefits associated with our corporate staff that is responsible for overall restaurant quality  future expansion into new locations  financial controls and reporting  restaurant management recruiting  training at granite city university  excess capacity costs related to our beer production facility that we opened in june  and salaries and expenses of our new store opening team when it is not dedicated to a particular restaurant opening 
other general and administrative expenses also include advertising  professional fees  office administration  centralized accounting system costs  and travel by our corporate management to the restaurant locations 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in from  in during  we added five corporate staff members 
additionally in we had a full year of impact for various new corporate level positions that were initially added in those new positions included our chief financial officer  granite city university trainers  members of our new store opening team  two regional directors of operations  as well as certain it  accounting and beer production facility employees 
these positions increased corporate level payroll by  in compared to non cash stock compensation comprised  of the total general and administrative expenses in as compared to  in the remainder of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to recruiting and training of new managers to support our continued growth 
the costs of all salaries  employee benefits  meals and lodging while the managers were attending granite city university and the cost of recruiting and relocating those managers following their assignments to restaurant locations increased as a result of adding seven new restaurants in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in as compared to in this decrease was the result of our continued improvement in leveraging corporate overhead across the increase in revenues 
as we continue to expand our restaurant chain  we expect general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues in the long term 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  in compared to due to the additional depreciation related to the newly opened restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation expense remained consistent at in and interest net interest expense consists of interest expense on capital leases and long term debt  net of interest earned from cash on hand 
interest expense increased  in as compared to  due to an increase in capital leases as a result of additional restaurants  while interest income decreased  due to a reduction of available cash

fiscal year included restaurant weeks  which is the sum of the actual number of weeks each restaurant operated  while fiscal year included restaurant weeks 
the increase in sales of for over was primarily the result of the additional restaurant weeks in related to our davenport  lincoln  and maple grove restaurants being in operation for a full year in  and our wichita  eagan  and kansas city  missouri  restaurants being in operation for a portion of due to increased demand fostered by the opening of a new restaurant  that restaurant typically experiences a temporary period of high revenues immediately following its opening the honeymoon effect 
we had five restaurants experiencing the honeymoon effect at various times during  while we had only three restaurants experiencing the honeymoon effect in  none of which experienced such effect until the last half of the year 
additionally  the three restaurants we opened in generated average weekly sales that were less than the average weekly sales of those restaurants we opened prior to as such  average weekly sales decreased from  per week in to  per week in comparable restaurant sales  which include restaurants in operation over months  decreased in restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease was due primarily to more experienced staff members generating less waste  as well as lower per unit product prices due to higher volume company wide purchasing 
labor our labor costs  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in  due primarily to increases in hourly labor as minimum wages increased and we had to compete more aggressively for management and hourly employees at our new restaurants 
direct operating and occupancy expenses our direct operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in operating supplies  repairs and maintenance  promotions and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct operating expenses  a substantial portion of which is fixed or indirectly variable

these new positions include our chief financial officer  granite city university trainers  members of our new store opening team  two regional directors of operations  as well as certain it  accounting and beer production facility employees 
this increase in corporate level payroll related costs accounted for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  during  in order to recruit and retain restaurant managers for the purpose of executing our restaurant growth plans and to allow for attrition  we trained over managers at granite city university 
the costs of all salaries  employee benefits  meals and lodging while the managers were attending granite city university and the cost of recruiting and relocating these managers accounted for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
salaries of restaurant managers whom we employed in our restaurants in excess of the needed level of managers to properly staff our restaurants and that we retained so as to strengthen our manager ranks for our restaurant growth plans were included in general and administrative expenses in this additional general and administrative payroll related cost for these managers accounted for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
finally  our fiscal year professional fees  including investor relations  consulting  legal and accounting  were approximately  higher than such fees in fiscal year depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  in compared to due to the additional depreciation related to the newly opened restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation expense increased from to interest interest expense increased  in compared to  due to an increase in debt and capital leases as a result of additional restaurants

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  of cash and a  working capital deficit compared to  of cash and  of net working capital at december  during the year ended december   the net cash generated from operations was  we used  to purchase assets for our new restaurants  beer production facility and our existing restaurants 
we obtained proceeds of  from capital leases to fund a portion of the property and equipment for restaurants we opened in we made payments of  on our bank debt and the building and equipment capital leases 
additionally we received  from the exercise of stock options 
during the year ended december   the private placement to accredited investors of common stock in october provided us  of net cash and the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants provided us  in net cash 
we used  of net cash in operating activities   in net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily for our wichita  eagan  and both kansas city locations as well as our beer production facility  made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations  and paid cash dividends to shareholders of our convertible preferred stock aggregating  we intend to continue expansion in markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
we plan to continue using our model as we open future restaurants  however  where appropriate  we will convert existing restaurants to our granite city concept 
additionally  we intend to explore alternative restaurant designs to reduce the cost of our initial capital investment and we may alter our model to meet various state and local regulatory requirements  including  but not limited to  pollution control requirements  liquor license ordinances and smoking regulations 
we intend to open eight new restaurants in and have entered into agreements or are in negotiation for location in illinois  arkansas  missouri and minnesota 
based upon our existing prototype  we anticipate that pre opening costs and the initial purchase of furniture  fixtures and equipment will require an investment by us of approximately million to million for each new restaurant 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will require an investment by our developer of approximately million to million each for land and building 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  labor markets and other variables 
to finance certain restaurant openings during  we entered into a master lease agreement with carlton financial corporation in august and an equipment lease commitment and master equipment lease with dhw leasing  llc during fiscal years and  we also commenced leases for our beer production facility corporate offices  test kitchen and ten restaurant properties 
details regarding such arrangements appear below under the captions commitments and contingent liabilities capital leases and commitments and contingent liabilities operating leases 
we will need to expend significant capital in connection with our expansion plans 
with our existing capital resources  cash generated from operations  and the proceeds available from our equipment lease facilities described below  we believe that we will have sufficient funds to complete our planned eight restaurant openings in and maintain sufficient working capital for our operations 
we will require further funding to open additional restaurants beyond we are continually evaluating our development plans and we are exploring options relative to the pace of our growth 
if our available sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our expected capital needs for  or our needs are greater than anticipated  we will be required to raise additional funds in the future through public or private sales of equity securities or the incurrence of indebtedness 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from current operations or if financing is not available to us  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our ability to fund our operations in future periods will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we elect to raise additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the sales may be at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations  covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business  and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs

in september  we entered into an amendment of this development agreement that applies to our omaha  madison and roseville restaurants as well as all future restaurants under the development agreement 
under the terms of the amendment  in lieu of previously negotiated future adjustments to restaurant lease rates  lease rates would be increased by commencing on the fifth anniversary of each lease and on each five year anniversary thereafter 
dunham also has the right to sell the underlying land and building to third parties or assign our leases 
as of february   dunham has sold three of our restaurants sites to third parties 
the assignment or sale of a lease by dunham has no material impact on our agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations under contractual agreements as of december  and the time frame within which payments on such obligations are due 
this table does not include amounts related to percentage rent  as such future amounts are not determinable 
in addition  whether we would incur any additional expense on our employment agreements depends upon the existence of a change in control of the company 
therefore  no percentage rent nor severance expense has been included in the following table

on april   the sec adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas r

 accounting for income taxes 
fin also provides guidance on the de recognition of uncertain tax positions  financial statement classification  accounting for interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods and adds new disclosure requirements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated statements 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
generally  the staff position requires companies to expense rental costs incurred during a construction period 
we were required to adopt fas beginning in fiscal year  and as a result  included such rental costs in pre opening expense during fiscal year prior to the adoption of fas  we did not expense rental costs during the construction period  but rather capitalized such costs as then permitted under gaap 
in march  the fasb emerging issues task force issued issue eitf  how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
a tentative consensus was reached that a company should disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf if taxes are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adapting eitf on our consolidated financial statement disclosure 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach  as those terms are defined in sab financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
if a company determines that an adjustment to prior year financial statements is required upon adoption of sab and does not elect to restate its previous financial statements  then it must recognize the cumulative affect of applying sab in fiscal year beginning balances of the affected assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the fiscal opening balance in retained earnings 
sab is effective for interim periods of the fiscal year ending after november  we do not believe sab will have material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas expands required disclosures about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality we expect that our sales and earnings will fluctuate based on seasonal patterns 
we anticipate that our highest sales and earnings will occur in the second and third quarters due to the milder climate and availability of outdoor seating during those quarters in our existing and proposed markets 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  supplies and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
in the past  we have been able to minimize the effect of these increases through menu price increases and other strategies 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
changes in interest rate pursuant to the terms of the loan we entered into in august for equipment at our des moines location  the interest rate increased from to effective august  as of december   the unpaid balance on this loan was  the interest rate on the loan we entered into in january for equipment at our davenport location increased from to effective january  as of december   the unpaid balance on this loan was  the basis point change we experienced in each of these rates  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt  will have an impact of approximately  on annual interest expense 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of the end of fiscal year  a basis point change in each of these rates would not have a significant effect on interest expense 
in fiscal year  we had cash equivalents throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds  which were most closely tied to the federal funds rate 
assuming a basis point change in the rate of interest associated with our investment  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
changes in commodity prices many of the food products we purchase are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
extreme fluctuations in commodity prices and or long term changes could have an adverse affect on us 
although sysco corporation is our primary supplier of food  substantially all of the food and supplies we purchase are available from several sources  which helps to control commodity price risks 
additionally  we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  in response to a food product price increases 
if  however  competitive circumstances limit our menu price flexibility  margins could be negatively impacted 
our company does not enter into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
