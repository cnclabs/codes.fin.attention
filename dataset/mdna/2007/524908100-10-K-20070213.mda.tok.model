item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management market risk for a further discussion of the market risks to which we are exposed 
our client flow revenues may decline in adverse market conditions 
we have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years  though over the past two years some central banks  and in particular the us federal reserve  have raised short term rates 
further increases in interest rates and long term rates in particular  especially if such changes are rapid  may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses 
rising interest rates may cause a decline in our mortgage origination and securitization businesses in particular  as the volume of our origination and securitization activity may decline 
recently  the residential real estate market in the us has experienced a downturn due to declining real estate values 
further declines in real estate values could further reduce our level of mortgage loan originations and could also reduce our level of securitizations 
our investment banking revenues  in the form of financial advisory and debt and equity underwriting fees  are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn 
a market downturn would also likely lead to a decline in the volume of capital market transactions that we execute for our clients and  therefore  to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads earned from the trades we execute for our clients 
in addition  because the fees that we charge for managing our clients portfolios are in many cases based on the value of those portfolios  a market downturn that reduces the value of our clients portfolios would reduce the revenues we receive from our asset management business 
even in the absence of a market downturn  below market investment performance by our fund and portfolio managers could reduce investment management revenues and assets under management 
we may incur losses due to fluctuations in market rates  prices and volatility 
market risk is inherent in our client driven market making transactions and proprietary trading and principal investment activities in equity and fixed income securities  commodities  currencies and derivatives and our mortgage and loan origination and syndication activities 
fluctuations in market rates  prices and volatility can adversely affect the market value of our long or short inventory and proprietary and principal positions and  to the extent that such positions are not adequately hedged  cause the firm to incur losses 
in our market making transactions  we maintain substantial inventory positions from time to time  acting as a financial intermediary for our clients  and we hold inventory positions in the normal course of business to allow clients to rebalance their portfolios and diversify risks across market cycles 
to the extent that we hold long inventory positions  a downturn in the market could result in losses from a decline in the value of those positions 
on the other hand  to the extent that we have sold inventory short  an upturn in those markets could expose us to losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
in our mortgage and loan origination and securitization businesses  we are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates 
most residential mortgages and consumer loans provide that the borrower may repay them early 
borrowers often exercise this right when interest rates decline 
as prepayments increase  the value of mortgages and other loans with prepayment features held in inventory prior to securitization generally will decrease  and to the extent that prepayment risk has not been hedged  prepayments may result in a loss 
market credit spreads are at historically tight levels  and a widening of credit spreads could negatively impact the value of our corporate debt and other inventory 
we also maintain long and short positions through our other proprietary trading activities and make principal investments such as in real estate and private equity  both of which are also subject to market risks 
the value of these positions can be adversely affected by changes in market rates  prices and volatility 
these risks will increase to the extent that we increase our proprietary trading and principal investing activities 
on the other hand our client flow and proprietary trading businesses generally depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and a decline in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses 
concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market making  block trading  underwriting  proprietary trading  principal investment and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we have committed substantial amounts of capital to these businesses  which often require us to take large positions in the securities of  or make large loans to  a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry  country or region 
moreover  the trend in all major capital markets is towards larger and more frequent commitments of capital in many of these activities  and we expect this trend to continue 
for example  large positions of securities are increasingly being sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis  which could increase the risk that we may be unable to resell the securities at favorable prices 
concentration of risk will increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and principal investing activities or commit additional capital to facilitate client driven business 
market risk may increase the other risks that we face 
in addition to the potentially adverse effects on our businesses described above  market risk could exacerbate other risks that we face 
for example  if we were to incur substantial market risk losses  our need for liquidity could rise significantly  while our access to liquidity could be impaired 
in addition  in conjunction with a market downturn  our clients and counterparties could incur substantial losses of their own  thereby weakening their financial condition and increasing our credit risk exposure to them 
credit risk we may incur losses associated with our credit exposures 
credit risk represents the possibility a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other financial instruments we hold or a borrower of funds from us will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
default risk may also arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect  such as fraud 
credit risk may arise  for example  from holding securities of third parties  entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us  executing securities  futures  currency or commodity trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries  and extending credit to our clients through bridge or margin loans or other arrangements 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk for a further discussion of the credit risks to which we are exposed 
our principal focus has been acting as an intermediary of credit 
in recent years  we have expanded our activities associated with providing our clients access to credit and liquidity and have also expanded our swaps and derivatives businesses 
as a result  our credit exposures have increased in amount and in duration 
defaults by another large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally 
the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit  trading  clearing or other relationships between the institutions 
as a result  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant market wide liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions 
this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries  such as clearing agencies  clearing houses  banks  securities firms and exchanges  with which we interact on a daily basis  and therefore could adversely affect lehman lehman brothers holdings inc 
brothers 
liquidity risk liquidity  that is ready access to funds  is essential to our businesses 
financial institutions rely on external borrowings for the vast majority of their funding  and failures in our industry are typically the result of insufficient liquidity 
an inability to access the debt markets could impair our liquidity 
we maintain a liquidity pool available to holdings that is intended to cover all expected cash outflows for one year in a stressed liquidity environment  which assumes  among other things  that during that year we cannot issue unsecured debt 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity risk management for a discussion of our liquidity needs and liquidity management 
to the extent that a liquidity event lasts for more than one year  or our expectations concerning the market conditions that exist during a liquidity event  or our access to funds  prove to be inaccurate eg  the level of secured financing haircuts the difference between the market and pledge value of the assets required to fund our assets in a stressed market event is greater than expected  or the amount of drawdowns under our commitments to extend credit in a stressed market environment exceeds our expectations  our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and fund operations could be significantly impaired 
even within the one year time frame contemplated by our liquidity pool  we depend on continuous access to secured financing in the repurchase and securities lending markets  which could be impaired by factors that are not specific to lehman brothers  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets 
we are a holding company and are dependent on our subsidiaries for funds 
since holdings is primarily a holding company  our cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations under securities we issue are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings as dividends or loans or other payments by those subsidiaries to holdings 
several of our principal subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory  banking and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate and or to capital targets established by various ratings agencies 
these regulatory rules  and certain covenants contained in various debt agreements  may restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries by dividends  loans or other payments 
further information about these requirements and restrictions is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  of this report 
additionally  our ability to participate as an equity holder in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation is generally subordinate to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary 
credit ratings our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings 
a reduction in our long or short term credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
credit ratings are also important to us when competing in certain markets  such as longer term over the counter derivatives 
therefore  a substantial reduction in our credit ratings would reduce our earnings and adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity risk management and credit ratings for additional information concerning our credit ratings 
operational risk operational risks may disrupt our businesses  result in losses or reputational damage or limit our growth 
we face operational risk arising from errors made in the execution  confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted for 
derivative contracts are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis  while the transaction remains unconfirmed  we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
consequently  we rely heavily on our financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  we could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of complex transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
in recent years  lehman brothers holdings inc 
we have substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other operating technology  and we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade and expand in the future to avoid disruption of  or constraints on  our operations 
our businesses and operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information  and  increasingly  on the internet 
we take extensive protective measures for our computer systems  internet sites  software and networks to protect against vulnerabilities to unauthorized access  computer viruses  denial of service attacks or other events that could have a security or business impact 
if  nevertheless  such events should occur  they could result in significant losses or reputational damage 
we also face the risk of operational or business failure of any of the clearing agents or other financial intermediaries or data providers we use  and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows  we face higher levels of operational risk that could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions  service our clients and manage our exposure to risk 
when we originate or purchase residential mortgage loans  we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties  including the information contained in the loan application  property appraisal  title information and employment and income documentation 
if any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented  whether by the loan applicant  the mortgage broker  another third party or one of our employees  and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding  the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected and or be unsaleable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation 
while relevant laws may not explicitly hold the originating lenders responsible for the legal violations of mortgage brokers  increasingly federal and state agencies have sought to impose such assignee liability 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical systems  communications  transportation or other services used by lehman brothers or third parties with which we conduct business  terrorist activities or disease pandemics 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in part ii  item  of this report for a description of our risk management infrastructure and procedures 
acquisitions or joint ventures could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs 
acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including difficulty with integrating personnel and financial and other systems  hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
in addition  we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition  and we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business 
legal  regulatory and reputational risk we face the risk of litigation and intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses 
among other things  we could be subjected to judgments or fines  be prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or be subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities  all of which could result in significant losses or reputational damage 
we face significant litigation risks in our businesses 
the volume of litigation against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have increased over the past several years 
we are exposed to potential liability as an underwriter under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities and other transactions  potential liability for the fairness opinions and other advice we provide to participants in corporate transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements 
we also face the possibility that counterparties in complex or risky trading transactions will claim that we improperly failed to tell them of the risks or that they were not authorized or permitted to enter into these transactions with us and that their obligations to lehman brothers are not enforceable 
in our investment management segment  we are exposed to claims against us for recommending investments that are not consistent with a client s investment objectives or engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading 
during a prolonged market downturn  we would expect these types of claims to increase 
we are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we incur significant legal expenses every year in defending against litigation  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
see part i  item  legal proceedings for a discussion of some of the legal and regulatory matters in which we are currently involved 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
extensive regulation of our businesses limits our activities and may subject us to significant penalties 
lehman brothers  as a participant in the financial services industry  is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in the us and under the laws of the many global jurisdictions in which we do business 
we are also regulated by a number of self regulatory organizations 
the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators  including the sec  nyse  nasd and state attorney generals 
penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities in our industry have increased substantially over the last several years 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with lehman brothers 
consequently  these regulations often serve to limit our activities  including through net capital  customer protection and market conduct requirements 
if we were found to have breached certain of these rules or regulations  we could face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities  including extended investigation and surveillance activity  adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties 
among other things  we could be fined or prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities 
additional legislation and regulations  changes in rules imposed by regulatory authorities  self regulatory organizations and exchanges or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may adversely affect our business and profitability 
our business may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable to us as an investment bank  but also by regulations of general application  including existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies including the interest rate and monetary policies of the federal reserve board and other central banks and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities 
in emerging markets in particular  we may be subject to risks of possible price controls  capital controls  currency exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions 
in many countries  the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving  and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market 
we are also subject to greater risk in these jurisdictions that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases 
in addition  in conducting business in these jurisdictions  we are often faced with the challenge of ensuring that our activities are also consistent with us or other laws with extra territorial application  such as the usa patriot act and the us foreign corrupt practices act 
our failure to comply with such laws could result in significant losses or reputational damage 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we have business operations 
these tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes 
we are subject to contingent tax risk that could adversely affect our results of operations  to the extent that our interpretations of tax laws are disputed upon examination or audit  and are settled in amounts in excess of established reserves for such contingencies 
see part i  item  business regulation for a further discussion of the regulatory environment in which we conduct our businesses 
our mortgage origination business is subject to special litigation and regulatory risks 
the laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our mortgage lending business are complex  frequently changing and  in some cases  in direct conflict with each other 
in particular  this business is subject to various laws  regulations and guidance that restrict non prime loan origination or purchase activities 
some of these laws and regulations provide for extensive assignee liability for warehouse lenders  whole loan buyers and securitization trusts 
in addition  the recent downturn in the us residential real estate market could result in increased complaints and claims relating to non prime mortgage origination practices 
as our mortgage origination operations continue to grow  both internally and through acquisitions  it may be more difficult to comprehensively identify and accurately interpret  and to implement our risk management policies  properly program our systems and effectively train our personnel with respect to  all of these laws and regulations  thereby potentially increasing our exposure to the risks of noncompliance  including possible civil and criminal liability  demands for indemnification or loan repurchases from purchasers of our loans including securitization trusts  class action lawsuits or administrative enforcement actions 
moreover  our customer base and counterparties in this business is substantially different from the high net worth and institutional customers and counterparties of most of our other businesses  which presents a different litigation risk profile 
exposure to reputational risks could impact the value of our brand 
our reputation is critical in maintaining our relationships with clients  investors  regulators and the general public  and is a key focus in our risk management efforts 
in recent years  there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud  conflicts of interest or lehman brothers holdings inc 
other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry  and we run the risk that misconduct by our employees could occur 
misconduct by employees could include binding lehman brothers to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks  or hiding from lehman brothers unauthorized or unsuccessful activities  which  in either case  may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
in addition  in certain circumstances our reputation could be damaged by activities of our clients in which we participate  or of hedge funds or other entities in which we invest  over which we have little or no control 
potential conflicts of interest are increasing 
as we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base  we increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest  including those relating to our proprietary activities 
for example  conflicts may arise between our position as a financial advisor in a merger transaction and a principal investment we hold in one of the parties to the transaction 
in addition  hedge funds and private equity funds are an increasingly important portion of our client base  and also compete with us in a number of our businesses 
in addition  the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest 
we have extensive procedures and controls that are intended to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest are appropriately addressed 
however  properly dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult  and our reputation could be damaged if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest and  it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions 
competitive environment all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
our competitive success depends on many factors  including our reputation  the quality of our services and advice  intellectual capital  product innovation  execution ability  pricing  sales efforts  and the talent of our personnel 
many of our competitors have greater capital resources and greater geographic reach than we do  which enhances their competitive positions 
we face increased competition due to a trend toward consolidation 
in recent years  there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry 
in particular  a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired broker dealers or have merged with other financial institutions 
many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products  from loans  deposit taking and insurance to brokerage  asset management and investment banking services  which may enhance their competitive position 
they also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share 
these abilities have resulted in pricing pressure in our businesses 
we have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years 
for example  equity and debt underwriting and trading spreads and fees for lending and other activities have been under competitive pressure for a number of years 
our revenues may decline due to competition from alternative trading systems 
securities and futures transactions are now being conducted through the internet and other alternative  non traditional trading systems  and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate 
a dramatic increase in computer based or other electronic trading may adversely affect our commission and trading revenues 
our ability to retain our key employees is critical to the success of our business 
our people are our most important resource 
our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract top talent and retain and motivate our existing employees while managing compensation costs 
risk management we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk  including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated 
some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior 
as a result  these methods may not predict future risk exposures  which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate 
management of operational  legal and regulatory risk requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events  and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify  monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses

business environment as a global investment bank  our results of operations can vary in response to global economic and market trends and geopolitical events 
a favorable business environment is characterized by many factors  including a stable geopolitical climate  transparent financial markets  low inflation  low unemployment  global economic growth  and high business and investor confidence 
these factors can influence i levels of debt and equity issuance and merger and acquisition m a activity  which can affect our investment banking business  ii trading volumes  financial instrument and real estate valuations and client activity in secondary financial markets  which can affect our capital markets businesses and iii wealth creation  which can affect both our capital markets and investment management businesses 
the global market environment was favorable again in  and generally supportive for growth in our businesses 
positive market conditions in included a combination of factors strong corporate profitability  deep pools of global liquidity  strong equity markets  low inflation and tightening credit spreads 
global equity markets rose to new highs on active trading levels 
m a and underwriting activities were also strong  driven by improved valuations  increased financial sponsor activity and a favorable interest rate environment 
equity markets 
global equity markets rose in local currency terms during  as most major global indices posted double digit increases from levels 
us equity markets ended the year strong as concerns over oil prices and inflation earlier in the year subsided and the federal reserve board the fed paused its interest rate tightening 
in  the new york stock exchange  dow jones industrial average  s p and nasdaq indices rose    and  respectively  from in the european equity markets  the ftse and dax rose and  respectively  from in asia  the nikkei and hang seng indices rose and  respectively  from these higher valuations served to fuel the equity origination calendar  and industry wide market volumes increased from levels 
in the us  the new york stock exchange  dow jones industrial average  s p and nasdaq average daily trading volumes increased    and  respectively  from in europe  average lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations daily trading volumes of the ftse and dax increased and  respectively  from average daily trading volumes on the nikkei and hang seng exchanges rose and  respectively  in from fixed income markets 
global interest rates  while up slightly over levels  continued to remain low in absolute terms 
the global economy grew at a strong pace in  with particular strength in the first half of the year 
with the exception of the united kingdom  growth rates generally slowed in the second half of due to the impacts of higher oil prices and the slowdown in the us housing market 
the us yield curve continued to flatten  as longer term yields were little affected by the federal funds rate increases of basis points during calendar the fed ended its interest rate tightening cycle in the third quarter as the us economy began to slow down  and inflationary concerns lessened 
conditions in europe were favorable as the economy expanded by during  on strong profitability and improved exports 
in japan  prospects for growth improved throughout as the bank of japan signaled its confidence by ending its policy of zero percent interest rates in july 
the yield curve ended the year inverted both in the us and uk  while flattening in japan and continental europe compared to strong global growth  deep pools of liquidity and low absolute interest rates all served to increase global trading volumes in fixed income in over levels 
total global debt origination increased in from  on higher issuances in virtually all products 
strong investor demand also led to a further tightening of credit spreads  most notably in high yield products 
mergers and acquisitions 
stronger equity valuations  together with a favorable interest rate environment during  led to a record m a market 
financial sponsors in particular were very active  and had large pools of capital at their disposal 
announced m a volumes increased in from  while completed m a volumes increased in compared to the prior year period 
economic outlook the financial services industry is significantly influenced by worldwide economic conditions in both banking and capital markets 
we expect global gdp growth of in  a slower rate than  but a level that continues to be favorable for this industry 
we expect the interest rate outlook to remain positive with the fed not raising interest rates next year  the european central bank raising interest rates only one more time  the bank of england raising rates twice during and the bank of japan increasing rates gradually throughout the year 
we also expect global corporate profitability will remain resilient in spite of the slower growth  with corporate earnings growing by in additionally  corporate balance sheets will remain strong  as cash on hand currently comprises approximately of total balance sheets 
we expect that all of the above will lead to continued growth of capital markets activities across all regions  with prospects for growth in non us regions in particular being highly favorable 
equity markets 
we expect that solid corporate profitability and pools of excess liquidity will continue to have a positive effect upon the equity markets in we expect global equity indices to gain in we also expect the equity offering calendar to increase by another to in  as businesses continue to look to raise capital 
fixed income markets 
we expect fixed income origination to remain strong  which in turn should have a positive impact on secondary market flows 
we expect approximately trillion of global fixed income origination in calendar  on par with as growth continues in europe and asia  we expect these regions to account for a more significant portion of global issuance 
we also expect both fixed income related products and the fixed income investor base to continue to grow with a global trend of more companies debt financing requirements being sourced from the debt capital markets 
fixed income activity is driven in part by the absolute level of interest rates  but also is highly correlated with the degree of volatility  the shape of the yield curve and credit quality  which in the aggregate impact the overall business environment 
the fixed income investor base has changed dramatically from long only investors of a few years ago to a continually growing hedge fund base and an expanding international investor base 
investors now employ far more developed risk mitigation tools to manage their portfolios 
in addition  the size and diversity of the global fixed income marketplace have become significantly larger and broader over the last several years as capital markets continue to represent a deeper and more viable source of liquidity 
mergers and acquisitions 
we expect announced m a activity to grow by in companies are looking to grow given the current market environment  and strategic m a is a viable option  particularly for companies with lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations strong balance sheets and stronger stock valuations 
furthermore  given the high levels of uninvested capital among financial sponsors  together with a continued favorable interest rate environment  we expect financial sponsor led m a activity to remain strong 
asset management and high net worth 
we expect the rise of global equity indices and continued growth in economies to lead to further wealth creation 
given the growth in alternative products being offered coupled with favorable demographics and intergenerational wealth transfer  our outlook for asset management and services to high net worth individuals is positive 
this growth will be further supported by high net worth clients continuing to seek multiple providers and greater asset diversification along with high service 
we believe the significant expansion of our asset management offerings and the strong investment return performances of our asset managers  coupled with our cross selling initiatives  position us well for continued growth in consolidated results of operations overview we achieved record net revenues  net income and diluted earnings per share in for the third consecutive fiscal year

liquidity  funding and capital resources management s finance committee is responsible for developing  implementing and enforcing our liquidity  funding and capital policies 
these policies include recommendations for capital and balance sheet size as well as the allocation of capital and balance sheet to the business units 
management s finance committee oversees compliance with policies and limits with the goal of ensuring we are not exposed to undue liquidity  funding or capital risk 
liquidity risk management we view liquidity and liquidity management as critically important to the company 
our liquidity strategy seeks to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all of our funding obligations in all market environments 
our liquidity strategy is centered on five principles we maintain a liquidity pool available to holdings that is of sufficient size to cover expected cash outflows over the next twelve months in a stressed liquidity environment 
we rely on secured funding only to the extent that we believe it would be available in all market environments 
we aim to diversify our funding sources to minimize reliance on any given providers 
liquidity is assessed at the entity level 
for example  because our legal entity structure can constrain liquidity available to holdings  our liquidity pool excludes liquidity that is restricted from availability to holdings 
we maintain a comprehensive funding action plan to manage a stress liquidity event  including a communication plan for regulators  creditors  investors and clients 
liquidity pool 
we maintain a liquidity pool available to holdings that covers expected cash outflows for twelve months in a stressed liquidity environment 
in assessing the required size of our liquidity pool  we assume that assets outside the liquidity pool cannot be sold to generate cash  unsecured debt cannot be issued  and any cash and unencumbered liquid collateral outside of the liquidity pool cannot be used to support the liquidity of holdings 
our liquidity pool is sized to cover expected cash outflows associated with the following items the repayment of all unsecured debt maturing in the next twelve months 
the funding of commitments to extend credit made by holdings and certain unregulated subsidiaries based on a probabilistic model 
the funding of commitments to extend credit made by our regulated subsidiaries including our banks is covered by the liquidity pools maintained by these regulated subsidiaries 
see contractual obligations and lending related commitments in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of adverse changes on secured funding either in the form of wider haircuts the difference between the market and pledge value of assets or in the form of reduced borrowing availability 
the anticipated funding requirements of equity repurchases as we manage our equity base including offsetting the dilutive effect of our employee incentive plans 
see equity management below 
in addition  the liquidity pool is sized to cover the impact of a one notch downgrade of holdings long term debt ratings  including the additional collateral that would be required for our derivative contracts and other secured lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding arrangements 
see credit ratings below 
the liquidity pool is primarily invested in highly liquid instruments including money market funds  bank deposits  us  european and japanese government bonds  and us agency securities and other liquid securities that we believe have a highly reliable pledge value 
we calculate our liquidity pool on a daily basis 
at november   the estimated pledge value of the liquidity pool available to holdings was billion  which is in excess of the items discussed above 
additionally  our regulated subsidiaries  such as our broker dealers and bank institutions  maintain their own liquidity pools to cover their stand alone one year expected cash funding needs in a stressed liquidity environment 
the estimated pledge value of the liquidity pools held by our regulated subsidiaries totaled an additional billion at november  funding of assets 
we fund assets based on their liquidity characteristics  and utilize cash capital to provide financing for our long term funding needs 
our funding strategy incorporates the following factors liquid assets ie  assets for which a reliable secured funding market exists across all market environments including government bonds  us agency securities  corporate bonds  asset backed securities and high quality equity securities are primarily funded on a secured basis 
secured funding haircuts are funded with cash capital 
illiquid assets eg  fixed assets  intangible assets  and margin postings and less liquid inventory positions eg  derivatives  private equity investments  certain corporate loans  certain commercial mortgages and real estate positions are funded with cash capital 
unencumbered assets  which are not part of the liquidity pool irrespective of asset quality  are also funded with cash capital 
these assets are typically unencumbered because of operational and asset specific factors eg  securities moving between depots 
we do not assume a change in these factors during a stressed liquidity event 
as part of our funding strategy  we also take steps to mitigate our main sources of contingent liquidity risk as follows commitments to extend credit cash capital is utilized to cover a probabilistic estimate of expected funding of commitments to extend credit 
see contractual obligations and lending related commitments in this md a 
ratings downgrade cash capital is utilized to cover the liquidity impact of a one notch downgrade on holdings 
a ratings downgrade would increase the amount of collateral to be posted against our derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
see credit ratings below 
client financing we provide secured financing to our clients typically through repurchase and prime broker agreements 
these financing activities can create liquidity risk if the availability and terms of our secured borrowing agreements adversely change during a stressed liquidity event and we are unable to reflect these changes in our client financing agreements 
we mitigate this risk by entering into term secured borrowing agreements  in which we can fund different types of collateral at pre determined collateralization levels  and by maintaining liquidity pools at our regulated broker dealers 
our policy is to operate with an excess of long term funding sources over our long term funding requirements 
we seek to maintain a cash capital surplus at holdings of at least billion 
as of november  and  our cash capital surplus at holdings totaled billion and billion  respectively 
additionally  cash capital surpluses in regulated entities at november  and amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
we hedge the majority of foreign exchange risk associated with investments in subsidiaries in non us dollar currencies using long term debt and forwards 
diversification of funding sources 
we seek to diversify our funding sources 
we issue long term debt in multiple currencies and across a wide range of maturities to tap many investor bases  thereby reducing our reliance on any one source 
cash capital consists of stockholders equity  portions of core deposit liabilities at our bank subsidiaries  and liabilities with remaining terms of over one year 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during  we issued billion of long term borrowings 
long term borrowings excluding borrowings with remaining contractual maturities within one year of the financial statement date increased to billion at november  from billion at november  principally to support the growth in our assets  as well as pre funding a portion of maturities 
the weighted average maturities of long term borrowings were years and years at november  and  respectively 
we diversify our issuances geographically to minimize refinancing risk and broaden our debt holder base 
as of november   of our long term debt was issued outside the united states 
we typically issue in sufficient size to create a liquid benchmark issuance ie  sufficient size to be included in the lehman bond index  a widely used index for fixed income asset managers 
in order to minimize refinancing risk  we set limits for the amount of long term borrowings maturing over any three  six and twelve month horizon at  and of outstanding long term borrowings  respectively that is  billion  billion and billion  respectively  at november  if we were to operate with debt above these levels  we would not include the additional amount as a source of cash capital 
long term debt is accounted for in our long term borrowings maturity profile at its contractual maturity date if the debt is redeemable at our option 
long term debt that is repayable at par at the holder s option is included in these limits at its earliest redemption date 
extendible issuances in which  unless debt holders instruct us to redeem their debt instruments at least one year prior to stated maturity  the maturity date of these instruments is automatically extended are included in these limits at their earliest maturity date 
based on experience  we expect the majority of these extendibles to remain outstanding beyond their earliest maturity date in a normal market environment and roll through the long term borrowings maturity profile 
the quarterly long term borrowings maturity schedule over the next five years at november  is as follows long term borrowings maturity profile chart 
gbkigif 

gbkigif 
included in long term debt is billion of structured notes with contingent early redemption features linked to market prices or other triggering events eg  the downgrade of a reference obligation underlying a credit linked note 
in the above maturity table  these notes are shown at their contractual maturity 
however  in determining the cash capital value of these notes we have excluded billion of the billion from our cash capital sources at november  lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use both committed and uncommitted bilateral and syndicated long term bank facilities to complement our long term debt issuance 
in particular  holdings maintains a billion unsecured  committed revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which expires in february in addition we maintain a billion multi currency unsecured  committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for lehman brothers bankhaus ag bankhaus  with a term of three and a half years expiring in april our ability to borrow under such facilities is conditioned on complying with customary lending conditions and covenants 
we have maintained compliance with the material covenants under these credit agreements at all times 
as of november   there were no borrowings against holdings or bankhaus credit facilities 
we have established a billion conduit that issues secured liquidity notes to pre fund high grade loan commitments 
this is fully backed by a triple a rated  third party  one year revolving liquidity back stop 
bank facilities provide us with further diversification and flexibility 
for example  we draw on our committed syndicated credit facilities described above on a regular basis typically to of the time on a weighted average basis to provide us with additional sources of long term funding on an as needed basis 
we have the ability to prepay and redraw any number of times and to retain the proceeds for any term up to the maturity date of the facility 
as a result  we see these facilities as having the same liquidity value as long term borrowings with the same maturity dates  and we include these borrowings in our reported long term borrowings at the facility s stated final maturity date to the extent that they are outstanding as of a reporting date 
we own three bank entities lehman brothers bank  a us based thrift institution  lbcb  a us based industrial bank  and bankhaus  a german bank 
these regulated bank entities operate in a deposit protected environment and are able to source low cost unsecured funds that are primarily term deposits 
these are generally insulated from a company specific or market liquidity event  thereby providing a reliable funding source for our mortgage products and selected loan assets and increasing our funding diversification 
overall  these bank institutions have raised billion and billion of customer deposit liabilities as of november  and  respectively 
legal entity structure 
our legal entity structure can constrain liquidity available to holdings 
some of our legal entities  particularly our regulated broker dealers and bank institutions  are restricted in the amount of funds that they can distribute or lend to holdings 
as of november   holdings total equity capital defined as total stockholders equity of billion plus billion of junior subordinated notes amounted to billion 
we believe total equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of our equity than stockholders equity because junior subordinated notes are equity like due to their subordinated nature  long term maturity and interest deferral features 
leading rating agencies view these securities as equity capital for purposes of calculating net leverage 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we aim to maintain a primary equity double leverage ratio the ratio of equity investments in holdings subsidiaries to its total equity capital of x or below 
our primary equity double leverage ratio was x as of november  and x as of november  certain regulated subsidiaries are funded with subordinated debt issuances and or subordinated loans from holdings  which are counted as regulatory capital for those subsidiaries 
our policy is to fund subordinated debt advances by holdings to subsidiaries for use as regulatory capital with long term debt issued by holdings having a maturity at least one year greater than the maturity of the subordinated debt advance 
funding action plan 
we have developed and regularly update a funding action plan  which represents a detailed action plan to manage a stress liquidity event  including a communication plan for regulators  creditors  investors and clients 
the funding action plan considers two types of liquidity stress events a company specific event  where there are no issues with the overall market liquidity  and a broader market wide event  which affects not just our company but the entire market 
in a company specific event  we assume we would lose access to the unsecured funding market for a full year and have to rely on the liquidity pool available to holdings to cover expected cash outflows over the next twelve months 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in a market liquidity event  in addition to the pressure of a company specific event  we also assume that  because the event is market wide  some counterparties to whom we have extended liquidity facilities draw on these facilities 
to mitigate the effect of a market liquidity event  we have developed access to additional liquidity sources beyond the liquidity pool at holdings  including unutilized funding capacity in our bank entities and unutilized capacity in our bank facilities 
see funding of assets above 
we perform regular assessments of our funding requirements in stress liquidity scenarios to best ensure we can meet all our funding obligations in all market environments 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents of billion at november  increased by billion from november   as net cash provided by financing activities of billion was partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of billion attributable primarily to growth in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and net cash used in investing activities of million 
cash and cash equivalents of billion at november  decreased million from november   as net cash used in operating activities of billion attributable primarily to growth in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned coupled with net cash used in investing activities of million exceeded net cash provided by financing activities of billion 
balance sheet and financial leverage assets 
our balance sheet consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  and collateralized financing agreements 
the liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business 
the majority of these assets are funded on a secured basis through collateralized financing agreements 
our total assets at november  increased by to billion  from billion at november   due to an increase in secured financing transactions and net assets 
net assets at november  increased billion due to increases across all inventory categories as we continue to grow the firm  including our client related businesses 
we believe net assets is a more useful measure than total assets when comparing companies in the securities industry because it excludes certain low risk  non inventory assets including cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes  securities received as collateral  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
this definition of net assets is used by many of our creditors and a leading rating agency to evaluate companies in the securities industry 
under this definition  net assets were billion and billion at november  and november   respectively  as follows net assets in millions november total assets cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes securities received as collateral securities purchased under agreements to resell securities borrowed identifiable intangible assets and goodwill net assets our net assets consist of inventory necessary to facilitate client flow activities and  to a lesser degree  proprietary and principal investment activities 
as such  our mix of net assets is subject to change 
the overall size of our balance sheet will fluctuate from time to time and  at specific points in time  may be higher than the year end or quarter end amounts 
our total assets at quarter ends were  on average  approximately and lower than amounts based on a monthly average over the four and eight quarters ended november   respectively 
our net assets at quarter ends were  on average  approximately and lower than amounts based on a monthly average over the four and eight quarters ended november   respectively 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations leverage ratios 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one measure used to evaluate the capital adequacy of a company 
the leverage ratio is calculated as total assets divided by total stockholders equity 
our leverage ratios were x and x at november  and november   respectively 
however  we believe net leverage based on net assets as defined above which excludes certain low risk  non inventory assets and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill divided by tangible equity capital total stockholders equity plus junior subordinated notes less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  is a more meaningful measure of leverage in evaluating companies in the securities industry 
our net leverage ratio of x at november  increased from x at november  we believe tangible equity capital is a more representative measure of our equity for purposes of calculating net leverage because junior subordinated notes are deeply subordinated and have a long term maturity and interest deferral features  and we do not view the amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and goodwill as available to support our remaining net assets 
this definition of net leverage is used by many of our creditors and a leading rating agency 
tangible equity capital and net leverage are computed as follows at november  and november  tangible equity capital and net leverage ratio in millions november total stockholders equity junior subordinated notes identifiable intangible assets and goodwill tangible equity capital leverage ratio x x net leverage ratio x x see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net assets  tangible equity capital and net leverage ratio as presented above are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies in the securities industry because of different methods of calculation 
equity management the management of equity is a critical aspect of our capital management 
the determination of the appropriate amount of equity is affected by a number of factors  including the amount of risk equity needed  the capital required by our regulators and balance sheet leverage 
we continuously evaluate deployment alternatives for our equity with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
in addition  in managing our capital  returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing shares is among the alternatives considered 
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital 
our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases  as well as through employee transactions where employees tender shares of common stock to pay for the exercise price of stock options  and the required tax withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of restricted stock units to freely tradable common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock through open market purchases at an aggregate cost of approximately billion  or per share 
in addition  we withheld approximately million shares of common stock from employees for the purposes described above at an equivalent cost of billion or per common share 
in total  we repurchased and withheld million shares during for a total consideration of approximately billion 
during we also issued million shares resulting from employee stock option exercises and another million shares were issued out of treasury stock into the rsu trust 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase  subject to market conditions  of up to million shares of holdings common stock for the management of our equity capital  including offsetting dilution due to employee stock awards 
this authorization supersedes the stock repurchase program authorized in lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included below are the changes in our tangible equity capital for the years ended november  and tangible equity capital in millions year ended november beginning tangible equity capital net income dividends on common stock dividends on preferred stock common stock open market repurchases common stock withheld from employees equity based award plans net change in preferred stock net change in junior subordinated notes included in tangible equity other  net ending tangible equity capital represents shares of common stock withheld in satisfaction of the exercise price of stock options and tax withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of restricted stock units 
this represents the sum of i proceeds received from employees upon the exercise of stock options  ii the incremental tax benefits from the issuance of stock based awards and iii the value of employee services received as represented by the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
junior subordinated notes are deeply subordinated and have a long term maturity and interest deferral features and are utilized in calculating equity capital by leading rating agencies 
credit ratings like other companies in the securities industry  we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing are affected by our short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that may be significant to the determination of our credit ratings or otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing include our profit margin  our earnings trend and volatility  our cash liquidity and liquidity management  our capital structure  our risk level and risk management  our geographic and business diversification  and our relative positions in the markets in which we operate 
deterioration in any of these factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings 
this may increase the cost of  or possibly limit our access to  certain types of unsecured financings and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
in addition  our debt ratings can affect certain capital markets revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as otc derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
at november   the short and long term senior borrowings ratings of holdings and lbi were as follows credit ratings holdings lbi short term long term short term long term standard poor s ratings services a a a aa moody s investors service p a p aa fitch ratings f a f a dominion bond rating service limited r middle a high r middle aa low on june   moody s investors service revised its outlook on holdings and its subsidiaries to positive from stable

the revised outlook suggests an upgrade of holdings long term ratings may occur if current trends continue 
on september   dominion bond rating service revised the rating trend on all long term ratings of holdings and its related entities to positive from stable 
at november   counterparties had the right to require us to post additional collateral pursuant to derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements of approximately billion 
additionally  at that date we would have been required to post additional collateral pursuant to such arrangements of approximately billion in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of one notch and billion in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of two notches 
contractual obligations and lending related commitments contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at november  in total and by remaining maturity  and at november  excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including secured financing transactions  trading liabilities  deposit liabilities at our banking subsidiaries  commercial paper and other short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase obligations contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 
lending related commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various lending related commitments 
in all instances  we mark to market these commitments with changes in fair value recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
we use various hedging and funding strategies to actively manage our market  credit and liquidity exposures on these commitments 
we do not believe total commitments necessarily are indicative of actual risk or funding requirements because the commitments may not be drawn or fully used and such amounts are reported before consideration of hedges 
these commitments and any related drawdowns of these facilities typically have fixed maturity dates and are contingent on certain representations  warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower 
through our high grade and high yield sales  trading and underwriting activities  we make commitments to extend credit 
we define high yield non investment grade exposures as securities of or loans to companies rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies  as well as non rated securities or loans that  in management s opinion  are non investment grade 
in addition  we make commitments to extend mortgage loans through our residential and commercial mortgage platforms in our capital markets business 
from time to time  we may also provide contingent commitments to investment and non investment grade counterparties related to acquisition financing 
our expectation is  lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our past practice has been  to distribute through loan syndications to investors substantially all the credit risk associated with these acquisition financing loans  if closed  consistent with our credit facilitation framework 
we do not believe these commitments are necessarily indicative of our actual risk because the borrower may not complete a contemplated acquisition or  if the borrower completes the acquisition  often will raise funds in the capital markets instead of drawing on our commitment 
in addition  we enter into secured financing commitments in our capital markets businesses 
lending related commitments at november  and were as follows total expiration per period at november  contractual amount and november november in millions later high grade high yield mortgage commitments investment grade contingent acquisition facilities non investment grade contingent acquisition facilities secured lending transactions  including forward starting resale and repurchase agreements we view our net credit exposure for high grade commitments  after consideration of hedges  to be billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
we view our net credit exposure for high yield commitments  after consideration of hedges  to be billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about lending related commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we engage in a variety of off balance sheet arrangements  including certain derivative contracts meeting the fin definition of a guarantee that may require future payments 
other than lending related commitments already discussed above in contractual obligations and lending related commitments  the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements at november  and as follows notional expiration per period at november  maximum amount and november november in millions later derivative contracts municipal securities related commitments other commitments with variable interest entities standby letters of credit private equity and other principal investment commitments we believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional amount overstates the expected payout

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contracts meeting the fin definition of a guarantee 
for additional information on these guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
derivatives derivatives often are referred to as off balance sheet instruments because neither their notional amounts nor the underlying instruments are reflected as assets or liabilities in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
instead  the market or fair values related to the derivative transactions are reported in the consolidated statement of financial condition as assets or liabilities in derivatives and other contractual agreements  as applicable 
in the normal course of business  we enter into derivative transactions both in a trading capacity and as an end user 
when acting in a trading capacity  we enter into derivative transactions to satisfy the financial needs of our clients and to manage our own exposure to market and credit risks resulting from our trading activities collectively  trading related derivative activities 
in this capacity  we transact extensively in derivatives including interest rate  credit both single name and portfolio  foreign exchange and equity derivatives 
additionally  in the company increased its trading in commodity derivatives 
the use of derivative products in our trading businesses is combined with transactions in cash instruments to allow for the execution of various trading strategies 
derivatives are recorded at market or fair value in the consolidated statement of financial condition on a net by counterparty basis when a legal right of set off exists and are netted across products when such provisions are stated in the master netting agreement 
as an end user  we use derivative products to adjust the interest rate nature of our funding sources from fixed to floating interest rates and to change the index on which floating interest rates are based eg  prime to libor 
we conduct our derivative activities through a number of wholly owned subsidiaries 
our fixed income derivative products business is principally conducted through our subsidiary lehman brothers special financing inc  and separately capitalized aaa rated subsidiaries  lehman brothers financial products inc and lehman brothers derivative products inc our equity derivative products business is conducted through lehman brothers finance sa and lehman brothers otc derivatives inc our commodity derivatives product business is conducted through lehman brothers commodity services inc in addition  as a global investment bank  we also are a market maker in a number of foreign currencies 
counterparties to our derivative product transactions primarily are us and foreign banks  securities firms  corporations  governments and their agencies  finance companies  insurance companies  investment companies and pension funds 
we manage the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis  along with the risks associated with our non derivative trading and market making activities in cash instruments  as part of our firm wide risk management policies 
we use industry standard derivative contracts whenever appropriate

special purpose entities in the normal course of business  we establish special purpose entities spes  sell assets to spes  transact derivatives with spes  own securities or interests in spes and provide liquidity or other guarantees for spes 
spes are corporations  trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose 
spes by their nature generally do not provide equity owners with significant voting powers because the spe documents govern all material decisions 
there are two types of spes qualifying special purpose entities qspes and variable interest entities vies 
our primary involvement with spes relates to securitization transactions through qspes  in which transferred assets are sold to an spe that issues securities supported by the cash flows generated by the assets ie  securitized 
a qspe generally can be described as an entity whose permitted activities are limited to passively holding financial assets and distributing cash flows to investors based on pre set terms 
under sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  we do not consolidate qspes 
rather  we recognize only the interests in the qspes we continue to hold  if any 
we account for such interests at fair value 
we are a market leader in mortgage both residential and commercial asset backed securitizations and other structured financing arrangements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our securitization activities

risk management as a leading global investment bank  risk is an inherent part of our businesses 
global markets  by their nature  are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks 
risk management is considered to be of paramount importance in our day to day operations 
consequently  we devote significant resources including investments in employees and technology to the measurement  analysis and management of risk 
while risk cannot be eliminated  it can be mitigated to the greatest extent possible through a strong internal control environment 
essential in our approach to risk management is a strong internal control environment with multiple overlapping and reinforcing elements 
we have developed policies and procedures to identify  measure and monitor the risks involved in our global trading  brokerage and investment banking activities 
we apply analytical procedures overlaid with sound practical judgment and work proactively with the business areas before transactions occur to ensure that appropriate risk mitigants are in place 
we also seek to reduce risk through the diversification of our businesses  counterparties and activities across geographic regions 
we accomplish this objective by allocating the usage of capital to each of our businesses  establishing trading limits and setting credit limits for individual counterparties 
our focus is on balancing risks and returns 
we seek to obtain adequate returns from each of our businesses commensurate with the risks they assume 
nonetheless  the effectiveness of our approach to managing risks can never be completely assured 
for example  unexpected large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and on our financial condition 
those events could cause losses due to adverse changes in inventory values  decreases in the liquidity of trading positions  increases in our credit exposure to clients and counterparties  and increases in general systemic risk 
our overall risk limits and risk management policies are established by management s executive committee 
on a weekly basis  our risk committee  which consists of the executive committee  the chief risk officer and the chief financial officer  reviews all risk exposures  position concentrations and risk taking activities 
the global risk management division the division is independent of the trading areas 
the division includes credit risk management  market risk management  quantitative risk management  sovereign risk management and operational risk management 
combining these disciplines facilitates a fully integrated approach to risk management 
the division maintains staff in each of our regional trading centers as well as in key sales offices 
risk management personnel have multiple levels of daily contact with trading staff and senior management at all levels within the company 
these interactions include reviews of trading positions and risk exposures 
credit risk credit risk represents the possibility that a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other financial instruments we hold will be unable or unwilling to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk management is therefore an integral component of our overall risk management framework 
the credit risk management department the crm department has global responsibility for implementing our overall credit risk management framework 
the crm department manages the credit exposures related to trading activities by approving counterparties  assigning internal risk ratings  establishing credit limits and requiring master netting agreements and collateral in appropriate circumstances 
the crm department considers the transaction size  the duration of a transaction and the potential credit exposure for complex derivative transactions in making our credit decisions 
the crm department is responsible for the monitoring and review of counterparty risk ratings  current credit exposures and potential credit exposures across all products and recommending valuation adjustments  when appropriate 
credit limits are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of market events or the counterparty s financial condition 
our chief risk officer is a member of the investment banking commitment  investment  and bridge loan approval committees 
members of credit and market risk management participate in committee meetings  vetting and reviewing lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations transactions 
decisions on approving transactions not only take into account the risks of the transaction on a stand alone basis  but they also consider our aggregate obligor risk  portfolio concentrations  reputation risk and  importantly  the impact any particular transaction under consideration would have on our overall risk appetite 
exceptional transactions and or situations are addressed and discussed with management s executive committee when appropriate

market risk market risk represents the potential adverse change in the value of a portfolio of financial instruments due to changes in market rates  prices and volatilities 
market risk management is an essential component of our overall risk management framework 
the market risk management department the mrm department has global responsibility for developing and implementing our overall market risk management framework 
to that end  it is responsible for developing the policies and procedures of the market risk management process  determining the market risk measurement methodology in conjunction with the quantitative risk management department the qrm department  monitoring  reporting and analyzing the aggregate market risk of trading exposures  administering market risk limits and the escalation process  and communicating large or unusual risks as appropriate 
market risks inherent in positions include  but are not limited to  interest rate  equity and foreign exchange exposures 
the mrm department uses qualitative as well as quantitative information in managing trading risk  believing that a combination of the two approaches results in a more robust and complete approach to the management of trading risk 
quantitative information is derived from a variety of risk methodologies based on established statistical principles 
to ensure high standards of analysis  the mrm department has retained seasoned risk managers with the requisite experience and academic and professional credentials 
market risk is present in both our long and short cash inventory positions including derivatives  financing activities and contingent claim structures 
our exposure to market risk varies in accordance with the volume of client driven market making transactions  the size of our proprietary trading and principal investment positions and the volatility of financial instruments traded 
we seek to mitigate  whenever possible  excess market risk exposures through appropriate hedging strategies 
we participate globally in interest rate  equity  foreign exchange and commercial real estate markets and  beginning in  certain commodity markets 
our fixed income capital markets business has a broadly diversified market presence in us and foreign government bond trading  emerging market securities  corporate debt investment and non investment grade  money market instruments  mortgages and mortgage and asset backed securities  real estate  municipal bonds  foreign exchange  commodity and credit derivatives 
our equities capital markets business facilitates domestic and foreign trading in equity instruments  indices and related derivatives 
as a global investment bank  we incur interest rate risk in the normal course of business including  but not limited to  the following ways we incur short term interest rate risk in the course of facilitating the orderly flow of client transactions through the maintenance of government and other bond inventories 
market making in corporate high grade and high yield instruments exposes us to additional risk due to potential variations in credit spreads 
trading in international markets exposes us to spread risk between the term structures of interest rates in different countries 
mortgages and mortgage related securities are subject to prepayment risk 
trading in derivatives and structured products exposes us to changes in the volatility of interest rates 
we actively manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate futures  options  swaps  forwards and offsetting cash market instruments 
inventory holdings  concentrations and aged positions are monitored closely 
we are a significant intermediary in the global equity markets through our market making in us and us equity securities and derivatives  including common stock  convertible debt  exchange traded and otc equity options  equity swaps and warrants 
these activities expose us to market risk as a result of equity price and volatility changes 
inventory holdings also are subject to market risk resulting from concentrations and changes in liquidity conditions that may adversely affect market valuations 
equity market risk is actively managed through the use of index futures  exchange traded and otc options  swaps and cash instruments

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we enter into foreign exchange transactions through our market making activities  and are active in many foreign exchange markets 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk on our holdings of non dollar assets and liabilities 
we hedge our risk exposures primarily through the use of currency forwards  swaps  futures and options 
we are a significant participant in the real estate capital markets through our global real estate group  which provides capital to real estate investors in many forms  including senior debt  mezzanine financing and equity capital 
we also sponsor and manage real estate investment funds for third party investors and make direct investments in these funds 
we actively manage our exposures via commercial mortgage securitizations  loan and equity syndications  and we hedge our interest rate and credit risks primarily through swaps  treasuries  and derivatives  including those linked to collateralized mortgage backed securities cmbs indices 
we are exposed to both physical and financial risk with respect to energy commodities  including electricity  oil and natural gas  through proprietary trading as well as from client related trading activities 
in addition  our structured products business offers investors structures on indices and customized commodity baskets  including energy  metals and agricultural markets 
risks are actively managed with exchange traded futures  swaps  otc swaps and options 
we also actively price and manage counterparty credit risk in the cds markets 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
we face operational risk arising from mistakes made in the execution  confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies  and these transactions have become increasingly complex 
consequently  we rely heavily on our financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
in recent years  we have substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other operating technology  and we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade and expand in the future to avoid disruption of  or constraints on  our operations 
operational risk management the orm department is responsible for implementing and maintaining our overall global operational risk management framework  which seeks to minimize these risks through assessing  reporting  monitoring and mitigating operational risks 
we have a company wide business continuity plan the bcp plan 
the bcp plan objective is to ensure that we can continue critical operations with limited processing interruption in the event of a business disruption 
the bcp group manages our internal incident response process and develops and maintains continuity plans for critical business functions and infrastructure 
this includes determining how vital business activities will be performed until normal processing capabilities can be restored 
the bcp group is also responsible for facilitating disaster recovery and business continuity training and preparedness for our employees 
reputational risk we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is important 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
potential clients are screened through a multi step process that begins with the individual business units and product groups 
in screening clients  these groups undertake a comprehensive review of the client and its background and the potential transaction to determine  among other things  whether they pose any risks to our reputation 
potential transactions are screened by independent committees in the firm  which are composed of senior members from various corporate divisions of the company including members of the global risk management division 
these committees review the nature of the client and its business  the due diligence conducted by the business units and product groups and the proposed terms of the transaction to determine overall acceptability of the proposed transaction 
in so doing  the committees evaluate the appropriateness of the transaction  including a consideration of ethical and social responsibility issues and the potential effect of the transaction on our reputation

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations value at risk value at risk var is an estimate of the amount of mark to market loss that could be incurred  with a specified confidence level  over a given time period 
the table below shows our end of day historical simulation var for our financial instrument inventory positions  estimated at a confidence level over a one day time horizon 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues losses on a particular day would exceed the reported var 
the historical simulation approach involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of our positions based on market risk factors embedded in the current portfolio and historical observations of daily changes in these factors 
our method uses four years of historical data weighted to give greater impact to more recent time periods in simulating potential changes in market risk factors 
because there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  different assumptions concerning the number of risk factors and the length of the time series of historical simulation of daily changes in these risk factors as well as different methodologies could produce materially different results and therefore caution should be used when comparing such risk measures across firms 
we believe our methods and assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable and prudent 
it is implicit in a historical simulation var methodology that positions will have offsetting risk characteristics  referred to as diversification benefit 
we measure the diversification benefit within our portfolio by historically simulating how the positions in our current portfolio would have behaved in relation to each other as opposed to using a static estimate of a diversification benefit  which remains relatively constant from period to period 
thus  from time to time there will be changes in our historical simulation var due to changes in the diversification benefit across our portfolio of financial instruments 
var measures have inherent limitations including historical market conditions and historical changes in market risk factors may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions or future market risk factors  var measurements are based on current positions  while future risk depends on future positions  var based on a one day measurement period does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day 
var is not intended to capture worst case scenario losses and we could incur losses greater than the var amounts reported 
value at risk historical simulation at november  average in millions high low interest rate and commodity risk equity price risk foreign exchange risk diversification benefit average historical simulation var was million for  up from million in reflecting the increased scale of our fixed income and equities capital markets businesses 
historical simulation var was million at november   up from million at november  primarily attributable to higher interest rate risk  due in part to a lower diversification benefit across fixed income products 
the increase in historical simulation var to million at november  from million on average in is also reflective of the growth in the company s business activities throughout the year  including proprietary and principal investing activities 
as part of our risk management control processes  we monitor daily trading net revenues compared with reported historical simulation var as of the end of the prior business day 
during  there was day when our daily net trading loss exceeded our historical simulation var measured at the close of the previous business day 
other measures of risk we utilize a number of risk measurement methods and tools as part of our risk management process 
one risk measure that we utilize is a comprehensive risk measurement framework that aggregates var  event and counterparty risks 
event risk measures the potential losses beyond those measured in market risk such as losses associated with a downgrade for high quality bonds  defaults of high yield bonds and loans  dividend risk for equity derivatives  deal break risk for merger arbitrage positions  defaults for sub prime mortgage loans and property value losses on real estate lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
utilizing this broad risk measure  our average risk for increased compared with  in part due to increased event risk associated with our real estate and credit positions  as well as the increase in our historical simulation var 
we also use stress testing to evaluate risks associated with our real estate portfolios which are non financial assets and therefore not captured in var 
as of november   we had approximately billion of real estate investments  however our net investment at risk was limited to billion as a significant portion of these assets have been financed on a non recourse basis 
as of november  we estimate that a hypothetical decline in the underlying property values associated with these investments would result in a net revenue loss of approximately million 
revenue volatility the overall effectiveness of our risk management practices can be evaluated on a broader perspective when analyzing the distribution of daily net trading revenues over time 
we consider net trading revenue volatility over time to be a comprehensive evaluator of our overall risk management practices because it incorporates the results of virtually all of our trading activities and types of risk including market  credit and event risks 
substantially all of the company s positions are marked to market daily with changes recorded in net revenues 
as discussed throughout this md a  we seek to reduce risk through the diversification of our businesses and a focus on client flow activities along with selective proprietary and principal investing activities 
this diversification and focus  combined with our risk management controls and processes  helps mitigate the net revenue volatility inherent in our trading activities 
the following table shows a measure of daily net trading revenue volatility  utilizing actual daily net trading revenues over the previous rolling trading days at a confidence level 
this measure represents the loss relative to the median actual daily trading net revenues over the previous rolling trading days  measured at a confidence level 
this means there is a in chance that actual daily net trading revenues declined by an amount in excess of the reported revenue volatility measure 
at november  average in millions high low interest rate and commodity risk equity price risk foreign exchange risk diversification benefit average net trading revenue volatility measured in this manner increased to million in up from million in  primarily due to the growth in our businesses

critical accounting policies and estimates generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make significant judgments  assumptions  or estimates 
the determination of fair value is our most critical accounting policy and is fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
fair value is the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged between willing parties in a current transaction  other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
management estimates are required in determining the fair value of certain inventory positions  particularly otc derivatives  certain commercial mortgage loans and investments in real estate  certain non performing loans and high yield positions  private equity investments  and non investment grade interests in securitizations 
other critical accounting policies include accounting for business acquisitions  including the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and the allocation of the cost of acquired businesses to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for our involvement with spes 
management estimates are also important in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the fair value of equity based compensation awards and provisions associated with litigation  regulatory  and tax proceedings 
management believes the estimates used in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of these and other accounting policies 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fair value we record financial instruments classified as financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased at market or fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
in all instances  we believe we have established rigorous internal control processes to ensure we use reasonable and prudent measurements of fair value on a consistent basis 
when evaluating the extent to which estimates may be required in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities reflected in our financial statements  we believe it is useful to analyze the balance sheet as shown in the following table summary balance sheet in millions november  assets financial instruments and other inventory positions owned securities received as collateral collateralized agreements cash  receivables and pp e other assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill total assets liabilities and equity short term borrowings and current portion of long term borrowings financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased obligation to return securities received as collateral collateralized financing payables and other accrued liabilities deposits at banks total long term capital total liabilities and equity long term capital includes long term borrowings excluding borrowings with remaining maturities within one year of the financial statement date and total stockholders equity 
we believe total long term capital is useful to investors as a measure of our financial strength 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are recorded at amounts for which significant management estimates are not used 
the following balance sheet categories  comprising of total assets and of total liabilities and equity  are valued either at historical cost or at contract value including accrued interest which  by their nature  do not require the use of significant estimates collateralized agreements  cash  receivables and pp e  short term borrowings and the current portion of long term borrowings  deposits  collateralized financing  payables and other accrued liabilities and total long term capital 
securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received as collateral are recorded at fair value  but due to their offsetting nature do not result in fair value estimates affecting the consolidated statement of income 
financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased long and short inventory positions  respectively are recorded at market or fair value  the components of which may require  to varying degrees  the use of estimates in determining fair value 
when evaluating the extent to which management estimates may be used in determining the fair value for long and short inventory  we believe it is useful to consider separately derivatives and cash instruments 
derivatives and other contractual agreements 
the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at november  were billion and billion  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included within these amounts were exchange traded derivative assets and liabilities of billion and billion  respectively  for which fair value is determined based on quoted market prices 
the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities at november  were billion and billion  respectively 
with respect to otc contracts  we view our net credit exposure to be billion at november   representing the fair value of otc contracts in a net receivable position after consideration of collateral 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth the fair value of otc derivatives by contract type and by remaining contractual maturity fair value of otc derivative contracts by maturity cross maturity  cross product less greater and cash net in millions than to to than collateral otc credit november  year years years years netting derivatives exposure assets interest rate  currency and credit default swaps and options foreign exchange forward contracts and options other fixed income securities contracts equity contracts liabilities interest rate  currency and credit default swaps and options foreign exchange forward contracts and options other fixed income securities contracts equity contracts cross maturity netting represents the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within the maturity category when appropriate 
cash collateral received or paid is netted on a counterparty basis  provided legal right of offset exists 
assets and liabilities at november  were netted down for cash collateral of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
includes commodity derivatives assets of million and liabilities of million

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the majority of our otc derivatives are transacted in liquid trading markets for which fair value is determined using pricing models with readily observable market inputs 
where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data  we value the derivative at the transaction price at inception  and consequently  do not record a day one gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
subsequent to the transaction date  we recognize any profits deferred on these derivative transactions at inception in the period in which the significant model inputs become observable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of these and other accounting policies 
examples of derivatives where fair value is determined using pricing models with readily observable market inputs include interest rate swap contracts  to be announced transactions tbas  foreign exchange forward and option contracts in g currencies and equity swap and option contracts on listed securities 
however  the determination of fair value of certain complex  less liquid derivatives requires the use of significant estimates as they often combine one or more product types  requiring additional inputs  such as correlations and volatilities 
such derivatives include certain credit derivatives  equity option contracts with terms greater than five years  and certain other complex derivatives we provide to clients 
we strive to limit the use of significant estimates by using consistent pricing assumptions between reporting periods and using observed market data for model inputs whenever possible 
as the market for complex products develops  we refine our pricing models based on market experience to use the most current indicators of fair value 
cash instruments 
the majority of our non derivative long and short inventory ie  cash instruments is recorded at market value based on listed market prices or using third party broker quotes and therefore does not incorporate significant estimates 
examples of inventory valued in this manner include government securities  agency mortgage backed securities  listed equities  money market instruments  municipal securities and corporate bonds 
however  in certain instances we may deem such quotations to be unrealizable eg  when the instruments are thinly traded or when we hold a substantial block of a particular security such that the listed price is not readily realizable 
in such instances  we determine fair value based on  among other factors  management s best estimate giving appropriate consideration to reported prices and the extent of public trading in similar securities  the discount from the listed price associated with the cost at date of acquisition and the size of the position held in relation to the liquidity in the market 
when the size of our holding of a listed security is likely to impair our ability to realize the quoted market price  we record the position at a discount to the quoted price  reflecting our best estimate of fair value 
when quoted prices are not available  fair value is determined based on pricing models or other valuation techniques  including the use of implied pricing from similar instruments 
pricing models typically are used to derive fair value based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows including adjustments  when appropriate  for liquidity  credit and or other factors 
for the vast majority of instruments valued through pricing models  significant estimates are not required because the market inputs to such models are readily observable and liquid trading markets provide clear evidence to support the valuations derived from such pricing models 
examples of inventory valued using pricing models or other valuation techniques for which the use of management estimates are necessary include certain commercial mortgage loans investments in real estate  non performing loans and certain high yield positions  private equity investments  and non investment grade retained interests 
mortgages  mortgage backed and real estate inventory positions 
mortgages and mortgage backed positions include mortgage loans both residential and commercial  and non agency mortgage backed securities 
we are a market leader in mortgage backed securities trading 
we originate residential and commercial mortgage loans as part of our mortgage trading and securitization activities 
we securitized approximately billion and billion of residential mortgage loans in and  respectively  including both originated loans and those we acquired in the secondary market 
we originated approximately billion and billion of residential mortgage loans in and  respectively 
in addition  we originated approximately billion and billion of commercial mortgage loans in and  respectively  the majority of which has been sold through securitization or syndicate activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our securitization activities 
we record mortgage loans at fair value  with related mark to market gains and losses recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
management estimates are generally not required in determining the fair value of residential mortgage loans because these positions are securitized frequently 
certain commercial mortgage loans and investments  due to their less liquid nature  may require management estimates in determining fair value 
fair value for these positions is generally based on analyses of both cash flow projections and underlying property values 
we use independent appraisals to support our assessment of the property in determining fair value for these positions 
fair value for approximately lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations billion and billion at november  and  respectively  of our total mortgage loan inventory is determined using the above valuation methodologies  which may involve the use of significant estimates 
because a portion of these assets have been financed on a non recourse basis  our net investment position is limited to billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
we invest in real estate through direct investments in equity and debt 
we record real estate held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value 
the assessment of fair value generally requires the use of management estimates and generally is based on property appraisals provided by third parties and also incorporates an analysis of the related property cash flow projections 
we had real estate investments of approximately billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
because significant portions of these assets have been financed on a non recourse basis  our net investment position was limited to billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
high yield instruments 
we underwrite  syndicate  invest in and make markets in high yield corporate debt securities and loans 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield instruments are defined as securities of or loans to companies rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies  as well as non rated securities or loans that  in management s opinion  are non investment grade 
high yield debt instruments generally involve greater risks than investment grade instruments and loans due to the issuer s creditworthiness and the lower liquidity of the market for such instruments 
in addition  these issuers generally have relatively higher levels of indebtedness resulting in an increased sensitivity to adverse economic conditions 
we seek to reduce these risks through active hedging strategies and through the diversification of our products and counterparties 
high yield instruments are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
our high yield instruments at november  and november  were as follows in millions year ended november bonds and loans in liquid trading markets loans held awaiting securitization and or syndication loans and bonds with little or no pricing transparency high yield instruments credit risk hedges high yield position  net loans held awaiting securitization and or syndication primarily represent warehouse lending activities for collateralized loan obligations 
credit risk hedges represent financial instruments with offsetting risk to the same underlying counterparty  but exclude other credit and market risk mitigants which are highly correlated  such as index  basket and or sector hedges 
at november  and november   the largest industry concentrations were and  respectively  categorized within the finance and insurance industry classifications 
the largest geographic concentrations at november  and november  were and  respectively  in the united states 
we mitigate our aggregate and single issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives  non recourse financing and other financial instruments 
non performing loans 
we purchase non performing loans in the secondary markets  primarily for the purpose of restructuring in order to sell or securitize at a profit 
non performing loans are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
non performing loans at november  and november  were approximately billion and million  respectively 
private equity and other principal investments 
our private equity business operates in five major asset classes merchant banking  real estate  venture capital  credit related investments and private funds investments 
we have raised privately placed funds in all of these classes  for which we act as general partner and in which we have general and in many cases limited partner interests 
in addition  we generally co invest in the investments made by the funds or may make other non fund related direct investments 
at november  and  our private equity related investments totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the real estate industry represented the highest lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concentrations at and at november  and  respectively  and the largest single investment was million and million  at those respective dates 
when we hold at least of a limited partnership interest  we account for that interest under the equity method 
we carry all other private equity investments at fair value based on our assessment of each underlying investment  incorporating valuations that consider expected cash flows  earnings multiples and or comparisons to similar market transactions among other factors 
valuation adjustments  which usually involve the use of significant management estimates  are an integral part of pricing these instruments  reflecting consideration of credit quality  concentration risk  sale restrictions and other liquidity factors 
additional information about our private equity and other principal investment activities  including related commitments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
non investment grade interests in securitizations 
we held approximately billion and billion of non investment grade retained interests at november  and  respectively 
because these interests primarily represent the junior interests in securitizations for which there are not active trading markets  estimates generally are required in determining fair value 
we value these instruments using prudent estimates of expected cash flows and consider the valuation of similar transactions in the market 
in addition  we utilize derivatives to actively hedge a significant portion of the risk related to these interests to limit our exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adverse changes in assumptions on the fair value of these interests 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill determining the fair values and useful lives of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed associated with business acquisitions intangible assets in particular requires significant judgment 
in addition  we are required to assess for impairment goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually using fair value measurement techniques 
periodically estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets with indefinite lives involves significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of such a charge 
we completed our last goodwill impairment test as of august   and no impairment was identified 
spes the company is a market leader in securitization transactions  including securitizations of residential and commercial loans  municipal bonds and other asset backed transactions 
the majority of our securitization transactions are designed to be in conformity with the sfas requirements of a qspe 
securitization transactions meeting the requirements of a qspe are off balance sheet 
the assessment of whether a securitization vehicle meets the accounting requirements of a qspe requires significant judgment  particularly in evaluating whether servicing agreements meet the conditions of permitted activities under sfas and whether or not derivatives are considered to be passive 
in addition  the evaluation of whether an entity is subject to the requirements of fin r as a variable interest entity vie and the determination of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of such vie is a critical accounting policy that requires significant management judgment 
legal  regulatory and tax proceedings in the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings 
such proceedings include actions brought against us and others with respect to transactions in which we acted as an underwriter or financial advisor  actions arising out of our activities as a broker or dealer in securities and commodities and actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants against many securities firms  including us 
in addition  our business activities are reviewed by various taxing authorities around the world with regard to corporate income tax rules and regulations 
we provide for potential losses that may arise out of legal  regulatory and tax proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated

accounting and regulatory developments sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the over or under funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its consolidated statement of financial condition  measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation 
for pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for other postretirement plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement obligation 
upon adoption  sfas requires an employer to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs within accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax  a component of stockholders equity 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year ending november  had we adopted sfas at november   we would have reduced accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax by approximately million  and recognized a pension asset of approximately million for our funded pension plans and a liability of approximately million for our unfunded pension and postretirement plans 
however  the actual impact of adopting sfas will depend on the fair value of plan assets and the amount of the benefit obligation measured as of november  sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about instruments carried at fair value  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas nullifies the guidance in eitf  which precluded the recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative contract  unless the fair value of such derivative was obtained from a quoted market price or other valuation technique incorporating observable market data 
sfas also precludes the use of a liquidity or block discount when measuring instruments traded in an active market at fair value 
sfas requires costs related to acquiring financial instruments carried at fair value to be included in earnings and not capitalized as part of the basis of the instrument 
sfas also clarifies that an issuer s credit standing should be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year  with earlier application permitted for our fiscal year 
sfas must be applied prospectively  except that the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of i a financial instrument that was traded in an active market that was measured at fair value using a block discount and ii a stand alone derivative or a hybrid instrument measured using the guidance in eitf on recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative  is to be applied as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings on the date we initially apply sfas we intend to adopt sfas in fiscal upon adoption we expect to recognize an after tax increase to opening retained earnings as of december  of approximately million 
sfas in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas 
sfas amends sfas with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities 
sfas requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  and permits companies to elect  on a class by class basis  to account for servicing assets and liabilities on either a lower of cost or market value basis or a fair value basis 
we elected to early adopt sfas and to measure all classes of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value beginning in our fiscal year 
servicing assets and liabilities at november  and all periods prior were accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or market value 
as a result of adopting sfas  we recognized an million after tax million pre tax increase to opening retained earnings in our fiscal year  representing the effect of remeasuring all servicing assets and liabilities that existed at november  from the lower of amortized cost or market value to fair value

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sfas we issue structured notes also referred to as hybrid instruments for which the interest rates or principal payments are linked to the performance of an underlying measure including single securities  baskets of securities  commodities  currencies  or credit events 
through november   we assessed the payment components of these instruments to determine if the embedded derivative required separate accounting under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and if so  the embedded derivative was bifurcated from the host debt instrument and accounted for at fair value and reported in long term borrowings along with the related host debt instrument which was accounted for on an amortized cost basis

sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which we adopted as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
sfas r requires public companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees 
expense is to be recognized over the period employees are required to provide service 
sfas r clarifies and expands the guidance in sfas in several areas  including how to measure fair value and how to attribute compensation cost to reporting periods 
under the modified prospective transition method applied in the adoption of sfas r  compensation cost is recognized for the unamortized portion of outstanding awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas upon adoption of sfas r  we recognized an after tax gain of approximately million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle attributable to the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab specifies how the carryover or reversal of prior year unrecorded financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab requires an approach that considers the amount by which the current year consolidated statement of income is misstated rollover approach and an approach that considers the cumulative amount by which the current year consolidated statement of financial condition is misstated iron curtain approach
