item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the heading item a risk factors 
management overview we are a leading online retailer of high quality diamonds and fine jewelry 
we have built a well respected consumer brand by employing an informative sales process that empowers our customers while offering a broad selection of high quality jewelry at competitive prices 
our websites showcase thousands of independently certified diamonds and styles of fine jewelry  including rings  wedding bands  earrings  necklaces  pendants  bracelets and watches 
our business model enables us to eliminate much of the cost associated with carrying diamond inventory 
we generally do not hold in our inventory the diamonds we offer for sale until we receive a customer order 
upon receipt of a customer order for a specific diamond  we purchase that diamond from one of our suppliers  who  if holding it  generally ships it to us in one business day 
we also hold certain diamonds on consignment until ordered 
we take title to the diamond at the time of its shipment from our supplier or  if held by us on consignment  at the time of order 
unlike diamonds  we typically take rings  wedding bands  earrings  necklaces  pendants  bracelets and watches into inventory before they are ordered by our customers 
as such  we are subject to costs associated with carrying such jewelry products and risks of potential mark downs 
we review our operations based on both our financial results and various non financial measures 
among the key financial factors upon which management focuses in reviewing performance are growth in net sales  gross profit  operating income and net cash provided by operating activities 
as an online retailer  we do not incur most of the operating costs associated with physical retail stores  including the costs of maintaining significant inventory and related overhead 
as a result  while our gross profit margins are lower than those typically maintained by traditional diamond and fine jewelry retailers  we are able to realize relatively higher operating income as a percentage of net sales 
in the year ended december   we had a gross profit margin  as compared to what we believe to be gross profit margins of up to or more by some traditional retailers 
our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe these lower prices  in turn  contribute to increased net sales 
our financial results  
table of contents including our net sales  gross profit and operating income can and do vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the seasonality of our net sales  general economic conditions  the costs to acquire diamonds and precious metals  the costs to acquire customers and our competitors pricing and marketing strategies 
during the year ended december   net sales increased to million from million in the year ended january  the increase in net sales is attributable to an increase in sales volume 
gross profit of million increased million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended january  operating income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the year ended january  as a result of an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily due to a significant increase in stock based compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas r  as described below 
net income decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended january  on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the fair value of stock options granted to be included in our financial statements 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective and modified prospective transition methods  which preclude prior period financial statements from being revised to reflect this change 
stock based compensation expense in the year ended december  was million compared to  in the year ended january  the accounting for stock based compensation under sfas r in had an impact of reducing net income and diluted earnings per share by million and per share  respectively 
we expect future stock based compensation expense to be significant 
as of december   the company had total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options accounted for using the modified prospective and prospective methods under sfas r of million 
we expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average period of years 
actual expense will depend on the nature  timing  and amount of future stock options granted and the assumptions used in valuing these stock options 
our tax accounting may also be impacted by actual stock option exercise behavior and the relative market prices at exercise 
among the key non financial measures we review are customer feedback and customer satisfaction ratings 
we believe that maintaining high overall customer satisfaction is critical to our ongoing efforts to promote the blue nile brand and to increase our net sales and net income 
we actively solicit customer feedback on our website functionality as well as on the entire purchase experience 
to maintain a high level of performance by our diamond and jewelry consultants  we also undertake an ongoing customer feedback process 
in august  we launched a website in the united kingdom  www 
bluenile 
co 
uk through which we offered a limited number of products 
in september  we began offering customization tools on our uk website to provide customers with the ability to customize their diamond jewelry products and to purchase wedding bands 
in january  we launched a website in canada  www 
bluenile 
ca  through which we offer diamond and jewelry products for sale 
sales through the uk and canada websites totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition blue nile recognizes revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which we estimate that customers have received their products 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the customer receipt date are not recorded as revenue 
we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is based on our historical product return rates 

table of contents our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return to our suppliers diamonds purchased and returned by our customers 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of employee stock options and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company performed the following sensitivity analysis using changes in the expected term and volatility that could be reasonably possible in the near term 
if we assumed a six month change in the expected term or a basis point change in expected volatility  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages increase decrease expected term expected volatility sensitivity to change in assumptions was determined using the black scholes merton valuation model compared to the following original assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of blue nile  inc common stock on december   expected term of years  expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of and a risk free investment rate of 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended year ended year ended december  january  january  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following describes certain line items set forth in our consolidated statement of operations net sales 
substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
we also generate net sales from upgrades to our free standard shipping 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  depreciation on assembly related assets  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  
table of contents including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefit costs for our employees  stock based compensation  marketing costs and credit card fees 
these expenses also include certain facilities  fulfillment  customer service  technology and depreciation expenses  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
fiscal year 
the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to december each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with an extra week added in the fourth quarter every five to six years 
the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated  including a comparison of the financial results for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share data comparison of comparison of year ended year ended december  to january  to year ended year ended year ended year ended year ended december  january  january  january  january  change change change change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative operating income other income expense  net interest income other income nm income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share comparison of year ended december  to year ended january  net sales net sales increased in  reflecting sales volume growth in all product categories in our domestic and international markets 
gross profit the increase in gross profit in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  resulted primarily from increases in net sales volume  as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended december  and in the year ended january  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our lower diamond pricing strategy that was implemented in the first quarter of to optimize gross profit  and to a lesser extent  cost increases 
table of contents in gold  silver and platinum jewelry that were not fully passed on to our customers 
volume increases in the non engagement jewelry category  which typically carries a higher gross margin than engagement  partially offset the decreases related to pricing 
the engagement category represented approximately of our total net sales in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended january  we expect that gross profit will fluctuate in the future based primarily on changes in product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  was due to several factors 
stock based compensation increased approximately million to million  compared to  in the year ended january   as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
we recorded million of stock based compensation expense as a result of the transition to accounting for stock based compensation at fair value using the modified prospective method in accordance with sfas r 
of this amount  million was recognized as selling  general and administrative expense and  was recognized as cost of sales 
marketing costs increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  primarily due to higher sales volume 
credit card processing fees increased approximately  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  due to the increase in sales volume 
payroll and related costs increased approximately  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  due to additional headcount and increased compensation costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower contractor and consultant costs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended january   which included costs related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the year ended december  and the year ended january   respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  resulted primarily from the addition of stock based compensation expenses as a result of the implementation of sfas r  as discussed above 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as a result of our marketing efforts to drive increases in net sales  growth in our fulfillment and customer service operations to support higher sales volumes and increases in credit card processing fees and other variable expenses 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income 
the increase of  in interest income in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  was due to an increase in interest rates during the year ended december  compared to the year ended january   partially offset by a decrease in the average cash balance in the year ended december  compared to the year ended january  as a result of share repurchases in income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended january  this change in tax rate resulted from adjustments arising from the final determination of our income tax expense and adjustments to deferred taxes for the year ended december  during  we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
comparison of year ended january  to year ended january  net sales the increase in net sales in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was primarily due to an increase in the net sales volume of engagement rings and diamond jewelry 
the remaining increase in net sales resulted primarily from growth in demand for loose diamonds  wedding bands 
table of contents and customized non engagement jewelry 
the engagement category represented approximately of our total net sales in the year ended january   as compared to in the year ended january  gross profit the increase in gross profit in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  resulted primarily from increases in sales volume  as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended january  and the year ended january  in the year ended january   we had a higher proportion of sales in the non engagement jewelry category than in the year ended january   which typically carries a higher gross margin than the engagement category 
this increase in gross margin related to higher jewelry sales was offset by lower gross margins in the engagement category 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was due to several factors 
costs associated with being a public company  including audit and other professional service fees and costs related to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  increased approximately million in the year ended january  marketing costs increased million in the year ended january  due to the increase in sales volume 
in addition  we experienced increases in online advertising rates during the year ended january  payroll and related costs increased approximately  in the year ended january  due primarily to the addition of new employees 
credit card processing fees increased approximately  in the year ended january  due to the increase in sales volume 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the year ended january  and the year ended january   respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  resulted primarily from our ability to leverage our fixed cost base 
in the year ended january   we recorded approximately  of stock compensation expense as compared to  in the year ended january  other income expense  net other income expense  net consisted primarily of interest income 
the increase in interest income in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in the average balance of cash and marketable securities during the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  income taxes in the year ended january  and the year ended january   we recognized income tax expense related to the provision for income taxes at the effective tax rate 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended january  was as compared to for the year ended january  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations through cash generated by operations  the sale of equity securities  subordinated indebtedness  credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  marketable securities and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our business model provides certain beneficial working capital characteristics 
while we collect cash from sales to customers within several business days of the related sale  we typically have extended payment terms with our suppliers 
as of december   working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million  partially offset by accounts payable of million 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and accounts payable are generally higher in the fourth quarter  resulting in fluctuations in our working capital 
during the year ended december   we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   january  and january   respectively

net cash used in financing activities in the year ended january  was million related primarily to repurchases of blue nile  inc common stock under a repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors in february the increase in net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises
