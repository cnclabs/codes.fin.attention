our industry semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems 
an integrated circuit  or ic  is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip 
since the 
table of contents invention of the transistor in  improvements in ic process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller  more complex and more reliable ics at a lower cost per function 
in order to satisfy the demand for faster  smaller and lower cost ics  semiconductor manufacturers have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology 
ics are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers 
use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing  use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis 
use of larger wafers can contribute further to a decrease in manufacturing costs per unit and to an increase in capacity by yielding more chips per wafer 
the availability of low cost semiconductors  together with increased customer demand for sophisticated electronic systems  has led to the proliferation of semiconductors 
today  virtually all electronic products use semiconductors  including pcs and related peripherals  wired and wireless voice and data communications and networking products including mobile telephones  facsimile and photocopy machines  home entertainment equipment  industrial control equipment and automobiles 
during most of  within the global semiconductor industry  we offered primarily x microprocessors for the commercial and consumer markets  which are used for control and computing tasks  and embedded microprocessors for commercial  commercial client and consumer markets 
as a result of our acquisition of ati in october  we began to supply d graphics  video and multimedia products and chipsets for desktop and notebook pcs  professional workstations  and servers as well as products for consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones  digital tvs and game consoles 
therefore  since this acquisition  we have actively participated in the semiconductor graphics and chipset markets as well as in the semiconductor market for consumer electronics devices 
computation products the x microprocessor market a microprocessor is an ic that serves as the central processing unit  or cpu  of a computer 
it generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system  acting as the brain of the computer 
the performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems 
the principal indicators of cpu performance are work per cycle  or how many instructions are executed per cycle  clock speed  representing the rate at which a cpu s internal logic operates  measured in units of hertz  or cycles per second  and power consumption 
other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of cpus  or cores  on a microprocessor  the bit rating of the microprocessor  memory size and data access speed 
developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance 
for approximately the last ten years  microprocessors have had bit computing capabilities 
the bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle 
while bit processors have historically been sufficient  we believe that they will face increasing challenges as new data and memory intensive consumer and enterprise software applications gain popularity 
microprocessors with bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory 
moreover  as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the exponential growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications  semiconductor manufacturers have transitioned from manufacturing single core microprocessors to also manufacturing multi core processors  where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor 
multi core 
table of contents processors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed 
moreover  two or more processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted 
this type of symmetrical multiprocessing is effective in both multi tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for multi threaded software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program  or threads  simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application 
businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology  which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership 
with the recent release of microsoft windows vista and with the proliferation of applications for multimedia and gaming  grid computing and extensive enterprise databases  we believe the demand for bit computing  multi core technology and improved power management technology will continue to increase 
microprocessor products we currently offer single core and dual core microprocessor products for servers  workstations  notebooks and desktop pcs 
our microprocessors currently are designed with both bit and bit processing capabilities 
we based our microprocessors on the x instruction set architecture and most of these processors are also based on the amd technology platform with direct connect architecture 
direct connect architecture connects an on chip memory controller and input output  or i o  channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores 
for dual core processors  we integrate two processor cores onto a single die and each core has its own dedicated cache  which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die 
we believe this architecture  and  in particular  the integrated memory controller  enables substantially higher performance because memory can be accessed more directly rather than traversing a traditional front side bus  which results in increased bandwidth and reduced memory latencies 
our processors support hypertransport technology  which is a high bandwidth communications interface we initially developed that enables substantially higher performance and supports our i o virtualization technology 
in designing our processors  we also focus on continuously improving power management technology  or performance per watt 
to that end  we offer processors that feature amd powernow technology  which we designed to reduce system level energy consumption  with multiple levels of lower clock speed and voltage states that can significantly reduce processor power consumption during idle times 
we design our microprocessors to be compatible with operating system software such as the microsoft windows family of operating systems  linux  netware  solaris and unix 
we also designed the amd architecture to enhance the security of a user s computing environment by integrating security features that are designed to prevent the spread of certain viruses when enabled by the anti virus features of current versions of certain operating systems  including linux  the microsoft windows family of operating systems and solaris operating systems 
servers and workstations 
our microprocessors for servers and workstations consist primarily of our single core and dual core amd opteron processors 
a server is a powerful computer on a network  often with multiple microprocessors working together  that is dedicated to a particular purpose  stores large amounts of information and performs the critical functions for that purpose 
a workstation is essentially a heavy duty desktop  designed for tasks such as computer aided design and digital content creation 
we based our amd opteron processors for servers and workstations on the amd technology platform  which extends the industry standard x instruction set architecture to bit computing  and designed them to allow simultaneous bit and bit computing 
these processors can be used in a variety of server applications  including business processing enterprise resource planning  customer relationship management  and supply chain management and business intelligence 
they can also be used in workstation applications such as engineering and digital content creation software and other information technology infrastructure applications such as intensive web serving and messaging 

table of contents our dual core amd opteron processors offer improved overall performance on many applications compared to single core amd processors by executing more operations simultaneously during each clock cycle  and improved performance per watt  which can reduce the operational costs related to power usage 
at the same time  servers based on dual core amd opteron processors are easier to manage because more processing capacity can be concentrated into fewer servers 
for the same reason  servers based on dual core processors are less costly to operate 
dual core amd opteron processors also allow our enterprise customers to more easily implement virtualization across their business 
virtualization is the use of software to allow workloads to be shared at the processor level by providing the illusion of multiple processors 
virtualization enables running different operating systems and applications on the same server  thereby consolidating workloads and reducing hardware requirements 
in august we introduced a new generation of amd opteron dual core processors 
these processors provide several new features including improved virtualization support and energy efficient ddr memory 
in addition  these processors can be replaced by amd quad core processors in the same socket and thermal envelope 
our quad core x processors for servers  which we expect to begin shipping in mid  will incorporate four processor cores on a single die of silicon 
ddr  or double data rate two  is a type of random access memory technology used for high speed storage of the working data of a computer 
notebook pcs 
our microprocessors for notebook pcs consist primarily of amd turion processors and mobile amd sempron processors 
we designed our mobile processor products for high performance  longer battery life and wireless connectivity 
amd turion processors represent our most advanced family of windows compatible processors for thinner and lighter notebook pcs  and provide performance improvements such as longer battery life  reduced heat generation  enhanced security and compatibility with current wireless and graphics solutions 
in may we introduced amd turion x dual core mobile technology  which is our most advanced dual core processor family for notebook pcs 
we designed this technology to enable leading edge graphics for the more visual experience provided by the microsoft windows vista operating system  longer battery life  enhanced security and compatibility with the latest wireless technologies 
in addition  we have designed the process used to manufacture amd turion mobile technology for more thermally efficient processor operation and reduced power consumption 
desktop pcs 
our microprocessors for desktop pcs consist primarily of the following tiered product brands amd athlon fx  amd athlon and amd sempron processors 
we designed the amd athlon fx processor specifically for gamers  pc enthusiasts and digital content creators who require processors that can perform graphic intensive tasks 
we designed our amd athlon processors for enterprises and sophisticated pc users that seek to access large amounts of data and memory 
for value conscious consumers of desktop and notebook pcs  we offer the amd sempron microprocessor  which we designed to provide core computing needs at affordable prices 
we also offer amd athlon x dual core processors and amd athlon fx x dual core processors  which like the dual core amd opteron processors  contain two processor cores on one semiconductor die 
the performance advantages of amd athlon x dual core processors enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously 
for example  users are able to simultaneously download audio files such as mps  record to digital media devices  check and write email  edit a digital photo and run virus protection without compromising the performance of their pc 
amd athlon x dual core processors also have an integrated ddr memory controller  which is designed to increase performance on memory intensive applications 
we designed the amd athlon x dual core processors for prosumer and digital media enthusiasts or other users who routinely run multiple processor intensive software applications simultaneously 
in december  we introduced a new generation of amd athlon x dual core processors which are manufactured using nanometer technology 
we designed these processors to deliver improved 
table of contents performance per watt by maintaining the performance of the previous generation of amd athlon x dual core processors and reducing power consumption 
to aid in reducing power consumption  these new processors incorporate a feature called c enhanced  a power management feature that slows selected system functions when not in use to reduce overall power consumption

in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date 
in addition  some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
in  avnet  inc and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated net revenue 
avnet is a distributor of our products and sales to avnet consisted primarily of products  from our computation products segment 
aib manufacturers and system integrators we strive to establish and broaden our relationships with aib manufacturers 
we offer component level graphics and chipset products to aib manufacturers who in turn build and sell board level products using our technology to sis and at retail 
we also work directly with our si customers 
sis typically sell from positions of regional or product based strength in the market 
they usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies 
sis often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers 

table of contents competition generally  the ic industry is intensely competitive 
products typically compete on product quality  power consumption  reliability  speed  size or form factor  cost  selling price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility and stability  brand recognition  timely product introductions and availability 
technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions  regular price reductions  short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements 
our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop  introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices  while reducing our manufacturing costs 
competition in the microprocessor market intel corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years 
intel s market power and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by intel s business practices  including rebating  and allocation strategies and pricing actions  designed to limit our market share  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  memory  chipset and basic input output system  or bios  suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for intel platforms  and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its oem customers 
intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and marketing programs 
because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market  intel has been able to control x microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of intel s competitors 
intel also dominates the computer system platform  which includes core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system 
as a result  oems that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on intel  less innovative on their own and  to a large extent  are distributors of intel technology 
additionally  intel is able to drive de facto standards for x microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing  research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do 
we expect intense competition from intel to continue 
competition in the embedded processor market with respect to our embedded processors for personal connectivity devices  our principal competitors are freescale semiconductor inc  hitachi  ltd  intel corporation  nec corporation  toshiba corporation and via technologies  inc we expect competition in the market for these devices to increase as our principal competitors focus more resources on developing low power embedded processor solutions 

table of contents competition in the graphics and chipset market in the graphics and chipset market  our competitors include discrete graphics suppliers and suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets 
a recent trend in the graphics processing market is that pc manufacturers are increasingly choosing to use integrated chipsets  particularly for notebook computers  over discrete gpus because integrated chipsets cost significantly less than discrete gpus while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream pc users 
intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market 
it is possible that intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets  which could shrink the total available market for certain of our discrete gpus  that intel could re enter the discrete gpu market  or that intel will take other actions that place our discrete gpus and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as designing a proprietary graphics interface 
other than intel  our principal competitor is nvidia corporation  and to a lesser extent  matrox electronic systems ltd  silicon integrated systems corp 
and via technologies  inc other competitors include a number of smaller companies which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs 
however  we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market 
competition in the consumer electronics market in the semiconductor market for consumer electronics products we have different competitors in each of our product categories 
with respect to our products for handheld devices  we have three primary categories of competitors vendors of baseband processors  vendors of applications processors and vendors of media co processors 
the baseband processor provides the basic voice and communication processing functionality in mobile phones 
for certain value categories of the market  baseband processor vendors are integrating the multimedia processing required for feature rich mobile phones 
baseband processor vendors incorporating this basic level of graphics processing include analog devices  inc  agere systems inc  broadcom corporation  freescale semiconductor inc  infineon technologies ag  koninklijke phillips electronics nv  qualcomm incorporated and texas instruments incorporated 
another category of competitor  application processor vendors  target manufacturer of high end feature and smart phones whose products require large amounts of general purpose processing capability as well as multimedia processing 
these vendors include freescale semiconductor inc  marvell technology group ltd  nvidia corporation  qualcomm incorporated  samsung electronics co  ltd  stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 
the third category of competitor provides dedicated processors to drive a high level of multimedia functionality 
this approach is most comparable to our strategy  and our competitors in this category include core logic incorporated  epson corp  mtek vision co 
ltd  nvidia corporation and renesas technology corp 
with respect to our products for digital tvs  our primary competitors include broadcom corporation  genesis microchip inc  mediatek inc  nec corporation  nxp semiconductors  stmicroelectronics nv  trident microsystems inc and zoran corporation  as well as in house semiconductor development divisions at companies such as lg electronics  inc  matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
a brand of panasonic electronic devices co  ltd  samsung electronics co 
ltd 
and toshiba corporation 
in the game console category  we compete primarily against nvidia 
other competitors include intel and ibm 
research and development we focus our research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development 
one main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance per watt characteristics 
we have devoted significant resources to product 
table of contents design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies and plan to do so in the future 
we also work with other industry leaders  public foundations  universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development 
with respect to graphics and chipsets and products for consumer electronics devices  our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever changing demands of the pc and consumer electronics industries on a timely basis so as to meet market windows 
we are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets  including commercial clients  mobile computing  and gaming and media computing 
we believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability  better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency

in august we announced the opening of a new research and development facility in shanghai  china 
also  in september we announced the opening of a new advanced microprocessor development facility in fort collins  colorado 
we conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with ibm 
under this agreement  we jointly develop new process technologies  including nanometer  nanometer  nanometer and certain other advanced technologies  to be implemented on silicon wafers 
our relationship also includes laboratory based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor  interconnect  lithography and die to package connection technologies 
we pay fees to ibm for joint development projects 
the actual amounts we pay to ibm are dependent upon the number of partners  including us and ibm  engaged in related development projects under the agreement 
in addition  we agreed to pay ibm specified royalties upon the occurrence of specified events  including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party 
for more information on the fees paid or payable to ibm  see part ii  item  contractual cash obligations and guarantees unconditional purchase commitments  and part i  item a  risk factors we cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive 
under the agreement  our joint development relationship continues through december  however  the continuation of capital purchases by ibm necessary for process development projects under the agreement past december  is conditioned upon the approval of ibm s board of directors 
if ibm s board of directors does not approve our agreement by september   either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective december  without liability 
in addition  our agreement with ibm may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business  becomes bankrupt or insolvent  liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder 
under our agreement  research and development takes place in ibm s watson research center in yorktown heights  ny  the center for semiconductor research at albany nanotech  and at ibm s millimeter manufacturing facility in east fishkill  ny we conduct research and development activities for our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices at design centers located throughout the world  including in the united states

due to the rapid pace of technological change in the graphics industry  our strategy is to focus on developing the newest generation of products that meet market and customer requirements on a timely basis so as to meet each market window 
manufacturing  assembly and test facilities we own and operate five manufacturing facilities  of which two are microprocessor wafer fabrication facilities and three are microprocessor assembly and test facilities 
we developed an approach to manufacturing called automated precision manufacturing  or apm 
apm comprises a suite of automation  optimization and real time data analysis technologies which automate the way decisions are made within our fabrication facilities 
we use apm during process technology transitions  and believe apm enables greater efficiency  higher baseline yields  better binning and faster yield learning 
our microprocessor manufacturing is conducted at the facilities described in the chart below 
these facilities are the cornerstone of our flexible capacity growth plan  which focuses on bringing the right amount of capacity online at the right time through ongoing  incremental increases in total output 
facility location wafer size diameter in millimeters principal production technology in nanometers approximate clean room square footage dresden  germany fab fab during  we manufactured our microprocessor products at fab and fab primarily on nanometer process technology 
in december  we began manufacturing using nanometer technology at fab our goal is to have substantially all of the wafers out of fab being manufactured on nanometer technology by mid and to begin manufacturing using nanometer technology in mid in may  we announced plans to significantly expand our millimeter manufacturing capacity in dresden  germany 
the expansion includes the conversion of fab from manufacturing on millimeter wafers to millimeter wafers  capacity expansion in fab  and the addition of a new facility to support bump and test activities 
bump and test is the final stage of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test 
we anticipate that after being converted to a millimeters facility  fab will be able to handle approximately up to  millimeter wafer starts per month 
we intend to begin to decrease millimeter production at fab in mid  and to bring up millimeter production in early use of millimeter wafers can contribute to decreasing manufacturing costs per unit and helps increase capacity by yielding significantly more chips per wafer than millimeter wafers 
use of smaller process geometries allows us to put more transistors on an equivalent size chip  which can result in products that are higher performing  use less power and or cost less to manufacture 
another facet of our flexible capacity growth strategy involves working with third party foundries  and to this end  we have sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with chartered semiconductor manufacturing pursuant to which chartered is an additional manufacturing source for our amd based microprocessors 
in june  we began our first revenue shipments of microprocessors manufactured at chartered 
we also have foundry arrangements with third parties for the production of our embedded processors  graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices 
in anticipation of the potential need for increased manufacturing capacity over the longer term  on december   we entered into a grant disbursement agreement with the new york state urban 
table of contents development corporation d b a empire state development corporation  or esdc  in connection with a potential new millimeter wafer fabrication facility on the luther forest technology campus in saratoga county  new york 
under the agreement  amd would be able to construct a new facility designed to produce millimeter wafers using nanometer process technology between july and july however  we are not obligated to commence construction  and our decision regarding proceeding with the construction is dependent on business conditions and market demand 
should we choose to build the facility  the state of new york is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of million 
actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred 
if we move forward with the project  we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by esdc and must maintain business operations on the luther forest technology campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved 
funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment  in whole or part  if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time 
our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are described in the chart set forth below facility location approximate manufacturing area square footage activity penang  malaysia  assembly singapore  test  mark packaging suzhou  china  test  mark packaging some assembly and final testing of our microprocessor and embedded processor products is performed by subcontractors in the united states and asia 
with respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices  we have strategic relationships with three semiconductor foundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  united microelectronics corp 
and chartered 
currently  we are in volume production in tsmc s and umc s millimeter fabrication facilities 
as of december   our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices were manufactured on     or nanometer process technologies at third party foundries 
smaller process geometries can lead to gains in graphics processing performance  lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs 
we intend to transition to nanometer process technology for some of these products in from the foundry  wafers for our graphics products are delivered to our test  assembly and packaging partners including advanced semiconductor engineering group  amkor  king yuan electronics  siliconware precision industries and stats chippac  who package and test the final application specific integrated circuit 
we outsource board level graphics product manufacturing to third party manufacturers 
these include celestica  fairway and pc partner with locations in china 
our facility in markham  ontario  canada is primarily devoted to prototyping and trial runs for new graphics product introductions 
raw materials our manufacturing processes require many raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ic packages  mold compound  substrates and various chemicals and gases  and the necessary equipment for manufacturing 
we obtain these materials and equipment from a large number of suppliers located throughout the world 
certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 

table of contents intellectual property and licensing we rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third party copying and use 
intellectual property rights include copyrights  patents  patent applications  trademarks  trade secrets and maskwork rights 
as of december   we had more than  patents in the united states and over  patent applications pending in the united states  including more than patents in the united states and patent applications in the united states that we acquired from ati 
in certain cases  we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions 
we expect to file future patent applications in both the united states and abroad on significant inventions  as we deem appropriate 
we do not believe that any individual patent  or the expiration thereof  is or would be material to our business 
in connection with the formation of spansion llc as of june and the closing of spansion s initial public offering  or ipo  in december  we and fujitsu transferred to spansion various intellectual property rights pursuant to an intellectual property contribution and ancillary matters agreement  or ipcaama 
under the ipcaama  spansion became the owner or joint owner with each of us and fujitsu  of specified patents  patent applications  trademarks and other intellectual property rights and technology 
the patents that we transferred included patents and patent applications covering flash memory products and technology  the processes necessary to manufacture flash memory products  and the operation and control of flash memory products 
we reserved rights  on a royalty free basis  to practice the contributed patents and to license these patents to our affiliates and successors in interest 
we also have the right to use the jointly owned intellectual property for our internal purposes and to license such intellectual property to others to the extent consistent with our non competition obligations to spansion 
in addition  for as long as our ownership interest in spansion remains above percent  spansion is required to identify its technology to us and to provide copies of  and training with respect to  that technology 
spansion also granted a non exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid and royalty free license of its rights in this technology to us 
we may grant licenses under spansion s patents  provided that these licenses are of no broader scope than  and are subject to the same terms and conditions that apply to  any license of our patents granted in connection with such license  and the recipient of such license grants to spansion a license of similar scope under its patents 
we also have a patent cross license agreement with fujitsu whereby each party was granted a non exclusive license under certain of the other party s respective semiconductor related patents 
this patent cross license agreement terminates on june   unless earlier terminated upon days notice following a change of control of the other party 
we also have a patent cross license agreement with spansion 
the patents and patent applications that are licensed are those with an effective filing date prior to the termination of the patent cross license agreement 
the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of june  and the date we sell our entire equity interest in spansion 
the agreements may be terminated by a party on a change in control of the other party or its semiconductor group 
in addition  as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights 
one such agreement is the patent cross license agreement with intel which was effective as of january  under this agreement we granted each other a non exclusive license under each party s patents for the manufacture and sale of semiconductor products worldwide 
we pay intel a royalty for certain licensed microprocessor products sold by us or any amd affiliate anywhere in the world 
the license applies to each party s patents that have a first effective filing date during the capture period  which is the period from january  through january  either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and does not correct the breach within days after receiving written notice thereof 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement upon days written notice in the event of a filing by the other party of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency  or any adjudication thereof  the filing of any petition seeking reorganization under any law relating to bankruptcy  the appointment of a receiver  the making of any 
table of contents assignment for the benefit of creditors  the institution of any proceedings for the liquidation or winding up of the other party s business  or in the event of a change of control 
for purposes of our agreement with intel  change of control means a transaction or a series of related transactions in which i one or more related parties who did not previously own at least a percent interest in a party obtain at least a percent interest in such party  and  in the reasonable business judgment of the other party  such change in ownership will have a material effect on the other party s business  or ii a party acquires  by merger  acquisition of assets or otherwise  all or any portion of another legal entity such that either the assets or market value of such party after the close of such transaction are greater than one and one third of the assets or market value of such party prior to such transaction 
backlog we manufacture and sell standard lines of products 
consequently  a significant portion of our sales are made from inventory on a current basis 
sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time 
these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty 
generally  in light of current industry practice and experience and the fact that substantially our entire order backlog is cancelable  we do not believe that such agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
environmental regulations many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air  water  and soil  remediation requirements  product chemical content limitations  manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions  pollution control requirements  waste minimization considerations  and requirements with respect to treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
if we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes  import export restrictions  sales limitations  and or criminal and civil liabilities 
existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment  to modify product designs  or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure to adequately control the use  disposal or storage  or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products 
these regulations affect semiconductor packaging 
other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world 
while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures  we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us

risk factors risks related to our business intel corporation s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively 
intel has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years 
intel s significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives  and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
intel also manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our new semiconductor graphics business that we have added through the acquisition of ati 
it is possible that intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets  which could shrink the total available market for certain of our discrete gpus  that intel could re enter the discrete gpu market  or that intel will take other actions that place our discrete gpus and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as designing a proprietary graphics interface 
moreover  computer manufacturers are increasingly using integrated graphics chipsets  particularly for notebooks  because they cost significantly less than traditional discrete graphics components while offering reasonably good graphics performance for most mainstream pcs 
the success of our graphics business is dependent  in part  upon the success of our integrated chipset products 
if our graphics products do not successfully address the discrete gpu and integrated chipset markets  our graphics business could be adversely affected 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by intel s business practices  including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions  designed to limit our market share  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  memory  chipset and basic input output system  or bios  suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for intel platforms  and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its oem customers

additionally  intel is able to drive de facto standards for x microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing  research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do 
moreover  intel currently manufactures a large portion of its processors using nanometer technology whereas we only began commercial shipments of processors 
table of contents manufactured using nanometer technology in the fourth quarter of to the extent intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using smaller process technologies  we may be more vulnerable to intel s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products  which may result in market share gains for intel 
intel s dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market  its existing relationships with top tier oems and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ati 
the success of our recent acquisition of ati depends  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of ati with the businesses of amd  and failure to realize these anticipated benefits could cause our business to be materially adversely affected 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends upon our successful integration of ati s operations 
the integration of two independent companies is a complex  costly  and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others retaining key employees  bridging possible differences in cultures and management philosophies  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and systems  coordinating sales and marketing functions  preserving our and ati s customer  supplier  ecosystem partner and other important relationships  aligning and executing on new products roadmaps  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
we cannot assure you that our integration of ati will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will result from the acquisition 
for example  it is possible that as a result of the acquisition  previous ati customers of discrete gpus may decide to purchase products that can be used with intel platforms from one of our competitors or that ecosystem partners will be wary of continuing to do business with us because they view the former ati operations as competitive with portions of their business 
any inability to integrate successfully  or a delay in integrating  ati could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive 
we make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies  products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete 
we also make substantial investments in research and development related to product design and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
for example  we recently opened a research and development facility in shanghai and an advanced microprocessor development facility in fort collins  colorado 
similarly  in connection with the recent acquisition of ati  we plan to continue to invest in research and development related to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices  including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called fusion 
moreover  in connection with the acquisition  we committed to the minister of industry of canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in canada when compared to 
table of contents ati s expenditures in this area in prior years 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to achieve planned investments in research and development or to otherwise maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive 
we have a joint development agreement with ibm  pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through december  we anticipate that under this agreement  we will pay fees to ibm of between million and million in connection with joint development projects from to capital purchases by ibm necessary for the continued development of process development projects past december  are conditioned upon the approval by ibm s board of directors 
if such approval is not received by september   either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective december  without liability 
if this agreement were to be terminated  we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner 
in either case  our research and development costs could increase  and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies  any of which would materially adversely affect us 
moreover  the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors using advanced process technologies 
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with required features and performance levels that provide value to our customers and support and coincide with significant industry transitions 
our success depends to a significant extent on the development  qualification  implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers 
our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements  at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets 
if we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies  such as what occurred with the multiple delays in the launch of our r gpu for the high end category of the pc market  we may lose credibility and our competitors may be able to take advantage of these delays by launching higher performing products before we do  which could cause us to lose market share and force us to discount the selling price of our products 
delays in developing or qualifying new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows 
market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
over the life of a specific product  the average selling price undergoes regular price reductions 
the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain overall corporate average selling prices 
if we are unable to introduce new products such as quad core processors or launch new products with sufficient increases in average selling price or increased unit sales volumes capable of offsetting these reductions in average selling prices of existing products  our revenues  inventories  gross margins and operating results could be adversely affected 
our ability to design and introduce new graphics products in a timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property 
in the design and development of new graphics products and graphics product enhancements  we rely on third party intellectual property such as software development tools 
historically  ati has experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of its products 
the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us 
if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands  our business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected  and may in the future materially adversely affect  our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns  often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change  wide fluctuations in supply and demand  continuous new product introductions  price erosion and declines in general economic conditions 
our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations 
our financial performance has been  and may in the future be  negatively affected by these downturns 
we incurred substantial losses in recent downturns  due to substantial declines in average selling prices  the cyclical nature of supply demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for end user products such as pcs that incorporate our products  excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution  including those of our customers  and excess production capacity 
for example  in and we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
if the semiconductor industry were to experience a downturn in the future  we would be materially adversely affected 
the demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold 
a market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our microprocessor business is dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop pcs and servers 
industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future 
depending on the growth rate of computers sold  sales of our products may not grow and may even decrease 
if demand for computers is below our expectations  we could be materially adversely affected 
the business we acquired from ati is also dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop pcs  the consumer electronics market and  in particular  the markets for digital tvs  handheld devices  such as multimedia enabled mobile phones  and game consoles 
a market decline in any of these industries would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets 
in  sales of our products to high growth markets such as china increased significantly compared to  and these markets are an important area of future growth for us 
if demand from these markets is below our expectations  sales of our products may not grow  and may even decrease  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive 
the markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth 
we expect competition to intensify due to rapid technological changes  frequent product introductions and aggressive pricing by competitors 
we believe that the main factors that determine our competitiveness are product quality  power consumption  reliability  speed  size or form factor  cost  selling price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility and stability  brand recognition  timely product introductions and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves  and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
we expect that competition will intensify in these markets and our competitors products may be less costly  provide better performance or 
table of contents include additional features that render our products uncompetitive 
with respect to our graphics products in particular  some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies  including interface  processor and memory technical information 
in addition  as a result of the ati acquisition  intel may discriminate against us and put us as a competitive disadvantage by giving our competitors in the graphics market preferential access to interface or other useful information 
generally  we may not be able to compete effectively because of intel s market dominance and business practices designed to maintain it 
we depend on third party companies for the design  manufacture and supply of motherboards  bios software and other components 
we depend on third party companies for the design  manufacture and supply of motherboards  bios software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings 
in addition  despite our recent acquisition of ati  we continue to work with other third parties for graphics chips in order to provide our customers with a greater choice of technologies to best meet their needs 
our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with intel does not extend to intel s proprietary bus interface protocol 
if we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from designers and manufacturers of motherboards and chipsets  our business would be materially adversely affected 
our recent acquisition of ati could exacerbate this problem because we plan to design and supply a significantly greater amount of graphics products ourselves 
doing so could cause third party designers  manufacturers and suppliers to be less willing to do business with us or to support our products out of a perceived risk that we will be less willing to support their products or because we may compete with them 
as a result  these third party designers  manufacturers and suppliers could forge relationships  or strengthen their existing relationships  with our competitors 
if the designers  manufacturers and suppliers of graphics chips  motherboards  and other components decrease their support for our product offerings and increase their support for the product offerings of our competitors  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we must achieve further market acceptance of our bit technology  amd  or we will be materially adversely affected 
we are making substantial investments in our microprocessor roadmaps and platforms  particularly as we transition from dual core to multi core processors 
increasing market acceptance of our processors  and the amd technology on which they are based  is subject to risks and uncertainties including the continued support of application program providers for our bit instruction set  including timely development of bit software applications and applications that can take advantage of the functionality of our multi core processors  our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner using advanced process technologies  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  and the availability  performance and feature set of components designed for these processors  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by our customers 
if we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our amd technology  we would be materially adversely affected 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our antitrust lawsuits against intel  our business may be materially adversely affected 
on june   we filed an antitrust complaint against intel corporation and intel s japanese subsidiary  intel kabushiki kaisha  which we refer to collectively as intel  in the united states district court for the district 
table of contents of delaware under section of the sherman antitrust act  sections and of the clayton act  and the california business and professions code 
our complaint alleges that intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of intel s customers in dealing with amd 
also  on june   our subsidiary in japan  amd japan kk  filed an action in japan against intel kk in the tokyo high court and the tokyo district court for damages arising from violations of japan s antimonopoly act 
on september   the united states district court for the district of delaware granted intel s motion to dismiss foreign conduct claims 
the effect of that decision was clarified by the court s january   adoption of the special master s decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery 
as a result of these two decisions  we will be permitted to develop evidence of intel s exclusionary practices wherever they occur  including practices foreclosing amd from foreign customers or in foreign market segments 
however  the court s ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the united states and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the united states 
the court also set an immovable trial date of april  if our antitrust lawsuits against intel are ultimately unsuccessful  our business  including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market  could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us 
collectively  our top five customers accounted for almost half of our total revenue in moreover  historically a significant portion of ati s revenues were derived from sales to a small number of customers  and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenues from our graphics and consumer electronics businesses in the future 
for example  for the period from october  to december   one handset manufacturer accounted for more than half of the revenue  and one game console provider accounted for a significant portion of the revenue  of our consumer electronics segment 
moreover  two customers accounted for approximately one third of the revenue of our graphics and chipsets segment 
if one of our top microprocessor  graphics business or consumer electronics customers decided to stop buying our products  or if one of these customers were to materially reduce its operations or its demand for our products  we would be materially adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns 
a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter 
this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
in addition  our operating results tend to vary seasonally 
for example  demand in the retail sector of the pc market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season 
european sales are often weaker during the summer months 
many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 
manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse affect on us 
there may be situations in which our microprocessor manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could result in an adverse effect on our relationships with customers  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  we entered into sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with chartered semiconductor manufacturing whereby chartered agreed to become a contract manufacturer for our amd based microprocessors 
although chartered has begun production  the ability of chartered to continue to ramp production on a timely basis depends on several factors beyond our control  including chartered s ability to continue to implement our technology at their facilities on a timely basis 
in addition  the additional capacity gained through the use of millimeter wafers at fab and our plans to increase capacity at fab and convert fab into a millimeter wafer manufacturing facility play a 
table of contents fundamental role in our growth plans for the next several years 
in order to transition fab to a millimeter facility  we plan to incrementally bring down its millimeter output beginning in mid  and we do not expect to have any millimeter output until early if we are not able to achieve our production plans on a timely basis  we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand for our microprocessor products 
if we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our microprocessor products  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements  we could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on third party foundries and other contractors to manufacture certain products 
we rely on independent foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and united microelectronics corp 
to manufacture our graphics and chipset products 
chartered semiconductor manufactures some of our microprocessor products and products for consumer electronics devices 
independent contractors also perform the assembly  testing and packaging of these products 
we obtain these manufacturing services for our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices on a purchase order basis and these foundries are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product 
accordingly  our graphics and consumer electronics businesses depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices 
we cannot assure you that these manufacturers will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements 
the manufacturers we use fabricate wafers for other companies  including certain of our competitors 
with respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices  they could choose to prioritize capacity for other users  reduce or eliminate deliveries to us  or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice 
we must have reliable relationships with our wafer manufacturers and subcontractors to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand 
if we move production of our products to new manufacturers or if current manufacturers implement new process technology or design rules  any transition difficulties may result in lower yields or poorer performance of our products 
because it could take several quarters to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner  we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific graphics product in a short time frame 
other risks associated with our dependence on third party manufacturers include reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and cost  lack of capacity in periods of excess demand  misappropriation of our intellectual property  dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors  reduced ability to manage inventory and parts  and exposure to foreign countries and operations 
if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of wafers  our ability to meet customer demand for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses may be adversely affected and this could have an adverse effect on us 
if essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessor manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis 
we purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
because the equipment that we purchase is complex  it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another 
certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we are largely dependent on one supplier for our millimeter and millimeter silicon on insulator soi wafers that we use to manufacture our microprocessor products 
we are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessor products 
similarly  certain non proprietary materials or components such as memory  pcbs  substrates and capacitors 
table of contents used in the manufacture of our graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources and often subject to rapid changes in price and availability 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if we are unable to procure certain of these materials  we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations 
such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us 
if we fail to improve the efficiency of our supply chain in order to respond to increases or changes in customer demand for our products  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends  in part  on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis 
accordingly  we must continually improve the management of our supply chain by synchronizing the entire supply chain  from sourcing through manufacturing  distribution and fulfillment 
as we continue to grow our business  acquire new oem customers and strengthen relationships with existing oem customers  the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because oems tend to have specific requirements for particular products  and specific time frames in which they require delivery of these products 
in the second half of  we experienced challenges in the ability of our supply chain to keep up with the significant ramp in microprocessor units sold across a diverse set of customers and geographies and to deliver products on a timely basis 
also  the breadth of our product portfolio increased significantly as a result of our acquisition of ati  which put stress on our supply chain 
if we fail to adequately improve the efficiency of our supply chain and adjust our operations in response to future increases or changes in oem demand for our products  our business could be materially adversely affected 
industry overcapacity could cause us to under utilize our microprocessor manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us 
both we and our competitor  intel  have added significant capacity in recent years  both by expanding capacity at wafer fabrication facilities and by transitioning to more advanced manufacturing technologies  and we plan on further increasing our capacity by expanding the production capacity of fab and converting fab into a millimeter wafer manufacturing facility 
in the past  capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry 
fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market  which may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us 
it is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the markets we serve  making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity 
if our target markets do not grow as we anticipate  we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities  which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products for which demand is lower than we anticipate 
in addition  during periods of industry overcapacity  customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity  which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements 
many of our costs are fixed 
accordingly  during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products  our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period 
when this occurs  our operating results are materially adversely affected 
if the demand for our microprocessor products is not consistent with our increased expectations  we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities or we may not fully utilize the reserved capacity at chartered s foundry 
this may have a material adverse effect on us 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to 
table of contents maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
we continually modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs 
we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  and delays in the development or implementation of new process technologies  changes in our process technologies  upgrades or expansion of existing facilities  or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process 
for example  beginning in mid we plan to incrementally bring down millimeter output at fab in order to transition this facility to millimeter manufacturing 
while this facility is being converted  we will have some fixed costs that cannot be scaled down in proportion 
improving our microprocessor manufacturing efficiency in future periods is dependent on our ability to develop advanced product and process technologies  successfully transition to advanced process technologies  ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our facilities  and achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields  which may decrease as we implement more advanced technologies 
we have begun to ramp nanometer production and our goal is to be substantially converted to nanometer in fab by mid during periods when we are implementing new process technologies  manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive 
a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do 
our results of operations would also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
similarly  the operating results of our graphics and consumer electronics businesses are dependent upon achieving planned semiconductor manufacturing yields 
our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are manufactured at independent foundries  but we have the responsibility for product design and the design and performance of the tooling required for manufacturing 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design and process technology  which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer  and low yields can result from either design or process technology failures 
in addition  yield problems require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer and sometimes the customer as well 
the offshore location of our principal manufacturers compounds these risks  due to the increased effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
we cannot assure you that we or our foundries will identify and fix problems in a timely manner  and achieve acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
our inability  in cooperation with our independent foundries  to achieve planned production yields for these products could have a material adverse effect on us 
in particular  failure to reach planned production yields over time could result in us not having sufficient product supply to meet demand and or higher production costs and lower gross margins for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses 
this could materially adversely affect us 
if we lose microsoft corporation s support for our products  our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to innovate beyond the x instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products 
if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x instruction sets  independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our microprocessors 
if we fail to retain the support of microsoft  our ability to market our microprocessors would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing  we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations 
for  we plan to make approximately billion of capital expenditures  primarily related to expanding production capacity at fab  beginning the conversion of fab from manufacturing on millimeter wafers to millimeter wafers and purchasing equipment for a new facility to support bump and test activities 
however  our ability to fund these capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing  if necessary 
our capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances 
the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition 
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities  including debt and equity financing 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
in addition  in order to finance our acquisition of ati  we borrowed billion pursuant to a credit agreement with morgan stanley senior funding inc dated october  october term loan 
while amounts remain outstanding under this agreement  we are required to prepay these amounts with i percent of the net cash proceeds from any debt incurred by us or a restricted subsidiary  ii percent of net cash proceeds from the issuance of any capital stock by us subject to specified exceptions  iii percent of extraordinary receipts as defined in the october term loan in excess of million  iv percent of net cash proceeds from asset sales outside of the ordinary course in excess of million  subject to a reinvestment allowance  v commencing with the fiscal year ending december   percent of excess cash flow  and vi percent of net cash proceeds from sales of capital stock of spansion inc see part ii  item  md a liquidity  for additional information on the definition of excess cash flow 
these mandatory prepayment requirements limit our ability to use our cash flow  borrow additional funds or conduct equity offerings for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 
our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures 
if we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects  we could be materially adversely affected 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position 
as of december  we had consolidated debt of approximately billion 
in addition  a significant portion of our consolidated debt bears a variable interest rate  which increases our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt  or our guarantees of other parties debts  will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  
table of contents and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt  we may be required to sell assets or equity  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  amounts outstanding under our october term loan are secured by  among other things  our accounts receivable  a pledge of the capital stock of specific material subsidiaries  specific intercompany debt  and proceeds from any sale of our equity interest in spansion inc moreover  as a result of the security interest granted to morgan stanley  holders of our outstanding senior notes due notes received an equal and ratable security interest 
these assets are not available to be used as security in other borrowing arrangements  which may also have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow additional funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
the october term loan and the indenture governing our notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  except specified permitted debt  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments if a default or an event of default exists  or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied  create or permit certain liens  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  consolidate  merge or sell assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety unless specified conditions are met  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  make or commit to make any capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business exceeding a certain amount  issue or sell any shares of capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries  permit domestic wholly owned restricted subsidiaries to guarantee our indebtedness unless they also guarantee the october term loan  and permit our consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the october term loan to exceed to 
in addition  the fab loan agreements contain restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on the ability of our germany subsidiary  amd fab limited liability company co 
kg  or amd fab kg  and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts 
our ability to satisfy these covenants  financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants  financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement 

table of contents moreover  our agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings 
for example  the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause a cross default under the october term loan or the indenture governing our notes 
the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders under the october term loan or the note holders or the trustee under the indenture governing our notes accelerates the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the state of saxony  the federal republic of germany and or the european union for fab  fab or other research and development projects we may undertake in germany  we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies  which could materially adversely affect us 
we receive capital investment grants and allowances from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab we have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies from these governmental entities for fab from time to time  we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the state of saxony  the federal republic of germany and the european union for certain research and development projects 
the subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with  and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants  allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
if we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents  we could be materially adversely affected 
if our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware 
further  we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner 
if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us 
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us 
products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing procedures  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future  which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  material recall and replacement costs  delay in recognition or loss of revenues  writing down the inventory of defective products  the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts  defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury  and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers 
in addition  we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field 
as a result  we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects 
any of these problems could materially adversely affect us 
in addition  because we sell directly to consumers  we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes  or merely appears to have caused  an injury 
claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products  and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others 
a product liability claim  recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our receipt of royalty revenues is dependent upon the success of third party products 
our graphics technology for the game console market is being used in the nintendo gamecube  nintendo wii and microsoft xbox game consoles 
the only revenues that we receive from these technology platforms are in the form of non recurring engineering revenues  as well as royalties paid to us by nintendo and microsoft based upon the market success of their products 
accordingly  our royalty revenues will be directly related to the sales of these products 
we anticipate royalties in future years resulting from our agreements with nintendo and microsoft 
however  we have no control over the marketing efforts of nintendo and microsoft and we cannot assure you that sales of those products will achieve expected levels in the current or future fiscal years 
consequently  the revenues from royalties expected by us from these technology platforms may not be fully realized  and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our entry into new consumer markets is subject to a number of uncertainties 
as a result of the ati acquisition  we sell products for the consumer electronics market  including digital tvs and color mobile phones 
there are a significant number of competitors targeting this market 
the delay in acceptance of digital tv technology has also provided further opportunities for competitors to enter this market 
in addition  as the telecommunications  cable and consumer electronics industries and their suppliers undergo a period of convergence  we expect that competition will increase in these markets 
our ability to succeed in these new consumer markets is subject to a number of uncertainties  including acceptance of our graphics and multimedia processors  the development of new technologies sufficient to meet market demand  the need to develop customer relationships  different sales strategies and channels  new and different industry standards from those in the pc market and changing strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in this new market 
if we are unable to successfully introduce products and compete in this market  we could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs 
our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and executive personnel  including the more than  employees we acquired through the ati acquisition 
if we are not able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business  the progress of our product development programs could be hindered  and we could be materially adversely affected 
we outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions  including physical distribution of our products  and co source some information technology services 
we rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for some of our manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we rely on a third party in india to provide certain information technology services to us  including helpdesk support  desktop application services  business and software support applications  server and storage administration  data center operations  database administration  and voice  video and remote access 
our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts 
we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms  in which case our internal operations  the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for some facilities could be materially adversely affected 
also  we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed  in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure 
however  if the costs related to administration  communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect  then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings 

table of contents uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could materially adversely affect us 
we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders 
we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements 
generally  our customers may cancel orders more than days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which are difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
moreover  pc and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles  which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  and the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize  could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory and an adverse effect on profit margins 
because market conditions are uncertain  these and other factors could materially adversely affect us 
our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks 
we market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party 
these agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products 
our third party distributors have been a significant factor in our ability to increase sales of our products in certain high growth international markets 
accordingly  we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts 
if any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products  our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected 
additionally  distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions  as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date 
some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors  resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs  until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors 
however  in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products  the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline 
our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we maintain operations around the world  including in the united states  canada  europe and asia 
for example  all of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in germany 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in china  malaysia and singapore 
in addition  our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in the asia pacific region and inventory related to those products is stored there 
we also have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy  we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets 
our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated revenue was percent in  and china was one of our largest and fastest growing markets 
the political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include  without limitation expropriation  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions

any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate  including public health or safety  natural disasters or general economic factors  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any of the above risks  should they occur  could result in an increase in the cost of components  production delays  general business interruptions  delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  potentially longer payment cycles  potentially increased taxes  restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us 
worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products 
worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products 
for example  china s economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years  and the chinese government introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth 
a decline in economic conditions in china could lead to declining worldwide economic conditions 
if economic conditions decline  whether in china or worldwide  we could be materially adversely affected 
the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the middle east have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect demand for our products 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations  directly or indirectly  and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive  which could materially adversely affect us 
the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales  and our supply chain 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us 
we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  and as a result of our recent acquisition of ati  the canadian dollar 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our canadian dollar and euro denominated expenses and yen based raw material purchases to increase as a percentage of revenue  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
whenever we believe appropriate  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of expenditures for items such as payroll  
table of contents equipment and materials used in manufacturing 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  the majority of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers 
an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products 
our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third party distributors 
from time to time  our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market 
gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us  thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately 
also  when gray market products enter the market  we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted gray market products  which adversely affect demand for our products 
in addition  our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues  because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel  there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products  including products that may have been altered  mishandled or damaged  or used products represented as new 
our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures  we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts  including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements  copyrights  patents  trademarks and common law rights  such as trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad 
any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
furthermore  patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or  if a patent is issued  the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights 
in addition  it is difficult to monitor compliance with  and enforce  our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner 
foreign laws may provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the united states 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad  we would be materially adversely affected 
we are party to litigation  including intellectual property litigation  and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of ati  we have assumed responsibility for ati s legal proceedings which include a securities litigation proceeding and a consumer class action 
in november  we received a subpoena for documents and information in connection with the us department of justice s criminal investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards 
we also sell products to consumers  which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages 

table of contents with respect to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been notified  or third parties may bring actions against us  based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in the event that we cannot obtain a license  these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages potentially including treble damages or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted  which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation 
the award of damages  including material royalty payments  or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products  would have a material adverse effect on us 
we could decide  in the alternative  to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities 
our operations and properties are subject to various united states and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes  discharge of pollutants into the environment  the treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  and remediation of contamination 
these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations  including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater 
although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with any of them  a range of consequences could result  including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  import export restrictions  sales limitations  criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used  stored  released  disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 
certain environmental laws  including the us comprehensive  environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or the superfund act  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources 
these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of  or was not responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated 
such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility 
we have been named as a responsible party on superfund clean up orders for three sites in sunnyvale  california 
although we have not yet been  we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future 
in addition  contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products 
these regulations affect semiconductor packaging  and we continue our work to ensure compliance across product lines 
there is a risk that the cost  quality and manufacturing yields of lead free products may be less favorable compared to lead based products or that the transition to lead free products may produce sudden changes in demand  which may result in excess inventory 
other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world 
we have management 
table of contents systems in place to identify and ensure compliance with such requirements and have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures 
however  we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
all of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in germany 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in china  malaysia and singapore 
the independent foundries used to manufacture our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are located in hsin chiu and tainan  taiwan 
a significant amount of our inventories for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses are stored in taiwan prior to delivery to customers 
many of our assembly  testing and packaging suppliers for our graphics products are also located in southern taiwan 
on september   taiwan suffered a major earthquake that measured on the richter scale and disrupted the operations of these manufacturing suppliers and contributed to a temporary shortage of graphics processors 
additional earthquakes  fires or other occurrences that disrupt our manufacturing suppliers may occur in the future 
to the extent that the supply from our independent foundries or suppliers is interrupted for a prolonged period of time or terminated for any reason  we may not have sufficient time to replace our supply of products manufactured by those foundries 
moreover  our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
in the event of a major earthquake  or other natural or manmade disaster  we could experience loss of life of our employees  destruction of facilities or business interruptions  any of which could materially adversely affect us 
our business is subject to potential tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states  canada and other foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  there could be a material effect on our cash  income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
for example  the canadian revenue agency  or cra  is in the process of auditing ati for the years with respect to transactions between ati and its subsidiaries 
we could be subject to significant tax liability as well as a loss of certain tax credits and other tax attributes as a result of the cra audit 
risks related to our ownership of spansion inc common stock spansion s financial position  results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours through december   but as a result of its initial public offering  we currently report our interest in spansion using the equity method of accounting 
following spansion s ipo  we owned approximately percent of spansion s outstanding common stock 
in november we sold shares of spansion s common stock  and as a result  as of december   we owned approximately percent of spansion s outstanding common stock 
our percent share of spansion s net income loss will impact our net income loss 
the following risks and uncertainties that spansion faces could affect spansion s financial position or results of operations and correspondingly our financial position and results of operations 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that spansion faces 
spansion also faces many of the risks and uncertainties that we face as described above in this risk factors section  as well as those set forth in spansion s annual report on form k and other sec filings  to which we refer you 

table of contents the demand for spansion s products depends in large part on continued growth in the industries into which they are sold 
a market decline in any of these industries  or a decline in demand for flash memory products in these industries  would have a material adverse effect on spansion s results of operations 
sales of spansion s flash memory products are dependent to a large degree upon consumer demand for mobile phones 
in fiscal  wireless customers  which primarily consist of mobile phone oems represented the largest market for nor flash memory 
in fiscal and fiscal  sales to wireless flash memory customers drove a majority of spansion s sales 
similarly  sales of spansion s products targeting embedded flash memory customers are dependent upon demand for consumer electronics such as set top boxes  or stbs  and dvd players  automotive electronics  industrial electronics such as networking equipment  pcs and pc peripheral equipment such as printers 
sales of spansion s products are also dependent upon the inclusion of increasing amounts of flash memory content in some of these products 
in fiscal and fiscal  sales to embedded flash memory customers drove a significant portion of spansion s sales 
if demand for mobile phones or products in the embedded portion of the flash memory market  or the flash memory content of these products  is below spansion s expectations  if the functionality of successive generations of such products does not require increasing flash memory density or if such products no longer require flash memory due to alternative technologies or otherwise  spansion would be materially adversely affected 
spansion has lost key intellectual property arrangements because it is no longer a beneficiary of our patent cross license agreements and other licenses  which creates a greatly increased risk of patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against spansion 
as a majority owned subsidiary through december   spansion had been the beneficiary of our intellectual property arrangements with third parties  including patent cross license agreements with other major semiconductor companies such as intel  motorola and ibm  and licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in spansion s products and software used to operate its business 
as a result of the conversion of spansion s outstanding shares of class d common stock into shares of spansion s class a common stock in november  spansion ceased to be a beneficiary under most of the remainder of these license agreements 
as a result  spansion may be subject to claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties through the manufacture and sale of spansion s products and the operation of spansion s business 
therefore  absent negotiating its own license agreements with the third parties who own such intellectual property  spansion will be vulnerable to claims by such parties that spansion s products or operations infringe such parties patents or other intellectual property rights 
spansion will continue to attempt to negotiate its own agreements and arrangements with third parties for intellectual property and technology that are important to spansion s business  including the intellectual property that it previously had access to through its relationship with us 
spansion will also attempt to acquire new patents as spansion s success in negotiating patent cross license agreements with other industry participants will depend in large part upon the strength of its patent portfolio relative to that of the third party with which it is negotiating 
if the third party benefits from an existing patent cross license agreement with us or fujitsu  in many cases it will retain the rights that it has under that agreement  including rights to utilize the patents that we and fujitsu transferred to spansion in connection with spansion s reorganization as spansion llc in june in many cases  any such third party will also retain such rights to utilize any patents that have been issued to spansion or acquired by spansion subsequent to spansion s reorganization and prior to spansion s ipo or  in some cases  at the time of the conversion of the class d common stock 
spansion s negotiating position will therefore be impaired  because the other party will already be entitled to utilize a large number of spansion s patents  while spansion no longer has the right to utilize that party s patents 
as a result  spansion may be unable to obtain access to the other party s patent portfolio on favorable terms or at all 
similarly  with respect to licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in spansion s products or software used to operate spansion s business  
table of contents spansion may not be able to negotiate prices with these third parties on terms as favorable to spansion as those previously available to spansion because it is not able to take advantage of our size and purchasing power 
these parties  and other third parties with whom we had no prior intellectual property arrangement  may file lawsuits against spansion seeking damages potentially including treble damages or an injunction against the sale of spansion s products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of spansion s business as presently conducted 
such litigation could be extremely expensive and time consuming 
spansion cannot be sure that such litigation would be avoided or successfully concluded 
the award of damages  including material royalty payments  or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture or sale of some or all of spansion s products  would have a material adverse effect on spansion 
a significant market shift to nand architecture could materially adversely affect spansion 
flash memory products are generally based either on nor architecture or nand architecture 
to date  spansion s flash memory products have been based on nor architecture which are typically produced at a higher cost per bit than nand based products 
spansion does not currently manufacture products based on nand architecture 
spansion has developed its mirrorbit ornand architecture to address certain portions of the integrated category of the flash memory market served by nand based products  but it cannot be certain that its mirrorbit ornand based products will satisfactorily address those market needs 
during  industry sales of nand based flash memory products grew at a higher rate than sales of nor based flash memory products  resulting in nand vendors in aggregate gaining a greater share of the overall flash memory market and nor vendors in aggregate losing overall market share 
this trend continued in and when sales of nand based flash memory products represented a majority of the flash memory products sold in the overall flash memory market 
in  and the first half of  sales of nand based flash memory products represented a majority of the flash memory products sold in the overall flash memory market 
moreover  the removable storage category of the flash memory market  which is predominantly served by floating gate nand vendors  is expected to be a significant portion of the flash memory market for the foreseeable future 
as mobile phones and other consumer electronics become more advanced  they will require higher density flash memory to meet the increased data storage requirements associated with music downloads  photos and videos 
because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data intensive applications  oems may increasingly choose higher density floating gate nand based flash memory products over mirrorbit nor  ornand or quad based flash memory products for their applications 
if this occurs and oems continue to prefer the attributes and characteristics of floating gate nand based products over those of mirrorbit nor  ornand or quad based products for their applications  spansion may be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  some floating gate nand vendors are manufacturing on millimeter wafers or may choose to utilize more advanced manufacturing process technologies than spansion uses today to offer products competitive to spansion s at a lower cost 
if floating gate nand vendors continue to increase their share of the flash memory market  spansion s market share may decrease  which would materially adversely affect spansion 
competitors may introduce new memory or other technologies that may make spansion s flash memory products uncompetitive or obsolete 
spansion s competitors are working on a number of new technologies  including fram  mram  polymer and phase change based memory technologies 
if successfully developed and commercialized as a viable alternative to flash memory  these or other technologies could pose a competitive threat to a number of flash memory companies  including spansion 
in addition  spansion and some of spansion s competitors have licensed flash memory intellectual property associated with nrom technology from a third party 
use of this nrom intellectual property may allow these competitors to develop flash memory technology that may compete with mirrorbit technology 

table of contents if spansion fails to successfully develop products based on its new mirrorbit nor  or mirrorbit ornand or mirrorbit quad architectures  or if there is a lack of market acceptance of products based on these products  spansion s future operating results would be materially adversely affected 
spansion is positioning itself to address the increasing demand for higher density data optimized flash memory by offering products based on its new mirrorbit ornand and mirrorbit quad architectures 
the success of these architectures requires that spansion timely and cost effectively develop  manufacture and market products based on these architectures that are competitive with floating gate nand based flash memory products 
spansion began commercial shipments of mirrorbit ornand based products in the second quarter of fiscal and announced the mirrorbit quad based family of products in january however  if spansion fails to develop and commercialize these products and additional products based on these architectures on a timely basis  spansion s future operating results would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  if market acceptance of products based on spansion s mirrorbit technology occurs at a slower rate than spansion anticipates  its ability to compete will be reduced  and spansion would be materially adversely affected 
if spansion does not achieve market acceptance of these products or subsequent mirrorbit products  spansion s future operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the loss of a significant customer or a reduction in demand for spansion s flash memory products from a significant customer in the mobile phone market could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
sales of spansion s products are dependent to a large extent on demand for mobile phones 
historically  a small number of wireless flash memory customers have driven a substantial portion of spansion s net sales 
if one of these customers decided to stop buying spansion s flash memory products  or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for spansion s products  spansion could be materially adversely affected 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal spansion was materially adversely affected by the reduced demand for mid range wireless handsets that incorporate custom high density nor based flash memory solutions 
spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 
spansion currently has and will continue to have for the foreseeable future  a substantial amount of indebtedness 
this substantial indebtedness may require spansion to use a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to make debt service payments  make it difficult for spansion to satisfy its financial obligations  limit spansion s ability to use its cash flows or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  limit spansion s flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in its business and industry  place spansion at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors  and increase spansion s vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
if spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flows and obtain external financing  it may be unable to make all of its planned capital expenditures 
spansion s ability to fund anticipated capital expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flows from operations and the availability of external financing 
spansion s capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on its cash flows and may decrease its cash balances 
the timing and amount of spansion s capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for its products  product mix  changes in industry conditions and market competition 
spansion may need to assess markets for external financing  including debt and equity 
such financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
any equity financing 
table of contents would cause dilution to its stockholders 
spansion s inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require it to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures 
if spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flows or obtain external financing  it may be delayed in achieving  or may not achieve  needed manufacturing capacity  and spansion could be materially adversely affected 
if spansion is unable to timely and efficiently expand its manufacturing capacity to implement millimeter wafer capacity at sp  spansion s business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
spansion intends to expand its manufacturing capacity to produce approximately  to  millimeter wafers per month at sp spansion s goal is to have and nanometer process technology on millimeter wafer capacity in place in fiscal in fiscal spansion commenced a plan to spend approximately billion over three years to construct and equip its planned flash memory manufacturing facility in aizu wakamatsu  japan  which spansion refers to as sp however  the actual cost and capacity achieved will vary depending on various factors  including available financing and future product demand 
financing for the construction of and equipment for sp may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if spansion does not achieve its desired capacity at the anticipated cost  or if spansion cannot obtain suitable financing  spansion may be delayed in achieving  or may not achieve  such capacity  and spansion could be materially adversely affected 
the timing for implementing millimeter capacity in sp will also depend in part on spansion s ability to execute its plan for constructing and equipping the facility and other factors that may be beyond its control  such as delivery schedules for the required machinery and equipment and construction schedules 
if spansion is delayed in implementing this capability or is unable to obtain foundry services at competitive rates or to timely and efficiently ramp production on millimeter wafers  it will not achieve anticipated cost savings associated with this technology and its gross margins could decline 
even if spansion is successful in implementing this capacity  if the demand for its products is not sufficient to support the additional capacity when it becomes available  it could be materially and adversely affected 
if spansion s cost reduction efforts are not effective  spansion s business could be materially adversely affected 
spansion continues to undertake a number of actions in an effort to significantly reduce its expenses 
these actions include and have included streamlining operations  continuing to align manufacturing utilization to the level of demand for spansion products  controlling increasing testing costs and working with us and fujitsu to reduce costs under services agreements 
we cannot assure you that any of these actions will occur as anticipated or at all  or that spansion will be able to achieve significant cost reductions 
if spansion s cost reduction efforts are unsuccessful  spansion would be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing capacity constraints may have a material adverse affect on spansion 
there may be situations in which spansion s manufacturing capacity is inadequate to meet the demand for some of its products 
spansion increasingly depends on foundry  subcontractor and similar arrangements with third parties to meet demand 
spansion s arrangements with third party suppliers do not necessarily include capacity guarantees 
if a third party manufacturer on which it relies does not have the capacity to deliver an adequate amount of product to meet actual demand  spansion may not be able to obtain the manufacturing capacity  either in its own facilities or through other third party arrangements  to meet such demand 
during fiscal  demand for certain of spansion s products exceeded the available supply 
as a result  spansion was unable to meet the demand of some of its customers for these products 
this could adversely impact spansion s relationships with customers  cause harm to spansion s reputation in the marketplace  cause these customers to move future business to spansion s competitors or cause spansion to make financial concessions to its customers 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
also  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal  spansion experienced capacity constraints for 
table of contents final test and assembly of some of its products 
these constraints continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal while spansion has worked internally and with subcontractors to increase capacity to meet anticipated demand  it cannot be assured that it will not experience similar constraints in the future 
these capacity constraints limit spansion s ability to respond to rapid and short term surges in demand for its products 
if spansion is unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand  either in its own facilities or through foundry  subcontractor or similar arrangements with third parties  or if it is unable to obtain foundry services at competitive rates  spansion s business may be materially adversely affected 
spansion s increased reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks that could materially adversely affect spansion 
spansion currently obtains foundry services from other companies  including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited  and following the sale of its jv and jv manufacturing facilities spansion will also obtain foundry services from fujitsu 
spansion also uses independent contractors to perform some of the assembly  testing and packaging of its products 
third party manufacturers are often under no obligation to provide spansion with any specified minimum quantity of product 
spansion depends on these manufacturers to allocate to spansion a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet spansion s needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to spansion on a timely basis at acceptable prices 
these manufacturers may not be able to meet spansion s near term or long term manufacturing requirements 
these manufacturers also make products for other companies  including certain of spansion s competitors  and or for themselves and could choose to prioritize capacity for themselves or other customers beyond any minimum guaranteed amounts  reduce deliveries to spansion or  in the absence of price guarantees  increase the prices they charge spansion on short notice  such that spansion may not be able to pass cost increases on to spansion s customers 
because it could take several quarters or more to establish a relationship with a new manufacturing partner  spansion may be unable to secure an alternative supply for specific products in a short timeframe or at all at an acceptable cost to satisfy spansion s production requirements 
in addition  spansion may be required to incur additional development  manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply 
other risks associated with spansion s increased dependence on third party manufacturers include their ability to adapt to spansion s proprietary technology  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and cost  lack of capacity in periods of excess demand  misappropriation of spansion s intellectual property  reduced ability to manage inventory and parts and risks associated with operating in foreign countries 
if spansion is unable to secure sufficient or reliable suppliers of wafers or obtain the necessary assembling  testing and packaging services  spansion s ability to meet customer demand for its products may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
spansion s business has been characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  which can negatively affect spansion s results of operations unless it is able to reduce its costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices 
average selling prices for spansion s products historically have declined over relatively short time periods 
spansion is unable to predict pricing conditions for future periods 
even in the absence of downturns or oversupply in the industry  average selling prices of spansion s products have decreased during the products lives 
when spansion s average selling prices decline  its net sales and net income decline unless it is able to compensate by selling more units  reducing its manufacturing costs or introducing new  higher margin products that have higher densities and or incorporate advanced features 
spansion has experienced declining average selling prices in the past  and it has stated that it expects to continue to experience them in the future  although spansion cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be 
if spansion s average selling prices continue to decline  its operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  average selling prices for spansion s products may also be adversely affected by a significant decline in the price for nand products 
such a decline may result in downward price pressure in the overall flash memory market  which would adversely affect spansion 

table of contents spansion is party to intellectual property litigation and may become party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products 
tessera  inc filed a lawsuit against spansion alleging that it has infringed certain of tessera s patents 
tessera has sought to enjoin such alleged infringement and to recover an unspecified amount of damages 
in addition  fujitsu has informed spansion that texas instruments has asserted that a number of its products infringe some of texas instruments patents 
fujitsu has also provided spansion with formal notice that they believe spansion has a duty to defend or indemnify fujitsu against texas instruments claims under the terms of its distribution agreement 
since then  spansion and fujitsu have been discussing the issues raised by this notice and if fujitsu were to terminate the distribution agreement with spansion  it could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
defending these alleged infringement claims and similar claims could be extremely expensive and time consuming and an award of damages or an injunction could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
intense competition in the flash memory market could materially adversely affect spansion 
spansion s principal competitors in the flash memory market are intel corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  stmicroelectronics  silicon storage technology  inc  macronix international co  ltd  toshiba corporation  sharp electronics corp  renesas technology corp  micron technology  inc and hynix semiconductor inc 
in the future  spansion s principal competitors may also include sandisk corporation and im flash technology  llc  the joint venture between intel and micron technology  inc the flash memory market is characterized by intense competition 
the basis of competition is cost  selling price  performance  quality  customer relationships and ability to provide value added solutions 
in particular  in the past  spansion s competitors have aggressively priced their products in order to increase market share  which resulted in decreased average selling prices for spansion s products in the second half of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal and adversely impacted its results of operations 
some of spansion s competitors  including intel  samsung  stmicroelectronics  toshiba  sharp and renesas  are more diversified than spansion is and may be able to sustain lower operating margins in their flash memory business based on the profitability of their other  non flash memory businesses 
in addition  recent capital investments by competitors have resulted in substantial industry manufacturing capacity  which may further contribute to a competitive pricing environment 
moreover  some of spansion s competitors are able to manufacture on millimeter wafers or may choose to utilize more advanced manufacturing process technologies than spansion uses today to offer products competitive to spansion s at a lower cost 
spansion has stated that it expects competition in the market for flash memory devices to intensify as existing manufacturers introduce new products  new manufacturers enter the market  industry wide production capacity increases and competitors aggressively price their flash memory products to increase market share 
competition also may increase if nor memory vendors merge  if nand memory vendors acquire nor businesses or other nand businesses  or if spansion s competitors otherwise consolidate their operations 
furthermore  spansion faces increasing competition from nand flash memory vendors in some portions of the integrated flash memory market 
spansion has also stated that it expects to face competition as it addresses new applications with the introduction of spansion s mirrorbit ornand and mirrorbit quad based products 
these products are intended to allow spansion to compete in the data storage portion of the integrated category and select portions of the removable category of the flash memory market that might otherwise be served by nand based flash memory products or other non volatile storage technologies such as rom or optical discs 
as a result  spansion may compete with a number of established nand based flash memory vendors and other incumbent suppliers of alternative technology in marketing and selling these products 
moreover  spansion s mirrorbit ornand and mirrorbit quad based products may not have the price  performance  quality and other features necessary to compete successfully for these applications 

table of contents to compete successfully  spansion must decrease its manufacturing costs and develop  introduce and sell products that meet the increasing demand for greater flash memory content in mobile phones  consumer electronics and automotive applications  among other markets  at competitive prices 
if spansion is unable to compete effectively  it could be materially adversely affected 
if essential equipment or adequate supplies of satisfactory materials are not available to manufacture spansion s products  spansion could be materially adversely affected 
spansion s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis 
spansion purchases equipment and materials from a number of suppliers 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supply to spansion or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
because the equipment that spansion purchases is complex  it is difficult for spansion to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another 
some raw materials spansion uses in the manufacture of spansion s products are available from a limited number of suppliers 
spansion s manufacturing operations also depend upon the quality and usability of the materials spansion uses in its products  including raw materials and wafers spansion receives from its suppliers 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal  spansion had lower than expected yields on  raw wafers received from one of its suppliers and spansion s revenue and gross margins were adversely affected 
if the materials spansion receives from its suppliers do not meet spansion s manufacturing requirements or product specifications  spansion may be materially adversely affected 
spansion also relies on purchasing commercial memory die from third party suppliers to incorporate these die into multi chip package  or mcp  products 
the availability of these third party purchased commercial die is subject to market availability  and the process technology roadmaps and manufacturing capacities of spansion s vendors 
for example  spansion s production was constrained in the first half of fiscal because of difficulties in procuring adequate supply of pseudo static ram  or psram 
in addition  some of spansion s major suppliers  including samsung  are also spansion s competitors 
interruption of supply from a competitor that is a supplier or otherwise or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if spansion is unable to procure these materials  or if the materials it receives from spansion s suppliers do not meet spansion s production requirements or product specifications  spansion may have to reduce its manufacturing operations or its manufacturing yields may be adversely affected 
such a reduction and yield issues have in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on spansion 
if the market value of our shares of spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares for an extended period of time  then our results of operations may be adversely affected 
if the market value of our shares of spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares and the decline in the market value level is deemed other than temporary  then we may be required to take an impairment charge in the amount of the difference between the book value and the market value 
for the quarter in which we take any such impairment charge  our results of operations could be adversely affected by the amount of such impairment charge 
in addition  the carrying value of our investment in spansion on our balance sheet would also be reduced 
therefore  sustained decreases in the market price of spansion s common stock could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations

in april  we announced plans for a new campus for design and administrative functions to be developed on approximately acres in austin  texas 
we expect that the campus will consist of approximately  square feet 
we intend to incorporate advanced environmentally sensitive building techniques and materials during the design  development and construction process and to concentrate development to approximately of the available acres 
the remainder of the land would remain undeveloped 
construction of the new campus is underway and we expect that we will occupy the facility in the second half of or the first half of we currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy  or replacing them with equivalent facilities 
we believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes  and that  except as discussed above  the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it

environmental matters we are named as a responsible party on superfund clean up orders for three sites in sunnyvale  california that are on the national priorities list 
since  we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites 
the chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the united states in the wafer fabrication process prior to in  we received final site clean up requirements orders from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three sites 
we have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders during the term of such agreements 
under these agreements other parties have assumed most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders 
we remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements 
to address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders  we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately million in accordance with applicable accounting rules and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup 
the progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty  and these costs may change
