the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar  including the related notes  provided in this report 
overview strategy staar is currently focusing on the following four strategic goals building the us market for the icl and securing us approval of the ticl  generating further growth of the icl and ticl in international markets  reversing the decline in us market share for our core cataract product lines by renewing and refining our product offering through enhanced r d  and maintaining our focus on regulatory compliance and continuous quality improvement 
building the us market for the icl and securing us approval of the ticl 
because the icl s design has advantages over other refractive procedures for many patients and its proprietary nature permits staar to maintain its profit margin  staar s management believes that increased sales of the icl are the key to the company s return to profitability 
us market penetration is considered essential because of the size of the us refractive surgery market and the perceived leadership of the us in adopting innovative medical technologies 
staar s strategy for the us market is to educate eye care professionals on the high quality of visual outcomes of the icl for a significant portion of patients seeking refractive surgery  and to make the icl available to selected surgeons only after completion of a training program that includes proctoring of selected supervised surgeries 
staar believes that this carefully guided method of product release is essential to help ensure the consistent quality of patient outcomes and the high levels of patient satisfaction needed to establish wide acceptance of the icl as a choice for refractive surgery 
to develop specialized resources to meet the challenge of penetrating the refractive market  and to take advantage of opportunities to improve cataract product sales  staar split its sales and marketing department into two separate groups in the first quarter of among other advantages  the split will enable the sales department to focus on the development of staar s direct sales model in regions where staar will sell directly  and to better coordinate sales initiatives with the independent regional marketing representatives in those regions where staar will continue to rely on independent representatives 

table of contents staar has relied on a largely independent sales force to sell its cataract products  and over the last several months has worked to re orient this sales force to deal with the very different practice environment for refractive products 
while staar expects to continue to rely on its independent sales force in some regions  it has moved to a direct sales structure in other regions 
because the refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  staar faces special challenges in introducing an intraocular refractive implant 
staar has developed a number of marketing tools and practice support programs to increase the use of the icl and awareness of its advantages at laser oriented surgery centers 
the visian icl was approved by the fda for treatment of myopia on december  the us rollout of the product began in the first quarter of as of december   surgeons had completed training and had completed training by march  staar recognized  of us sales revenue from icls in it is too early to determine whether staar s strategy will be successful or to estimate the ultimate size of the us market for icls 
staar believes that the visian ticl  a variant of the icl that corrects both astigmatism and myopia in a single lens  also has a significant potential market in the us when measured six months after surgery  approximately of the patients receiving the ticl have shown better visual acuity than the best they previously achieved with glasses or contact lenses 
securing fda approval of the ticl is therefore an integral part of staar s strategy to develop its us refractive market 
staar submitted a pre market approval pma application for the ticl to the fda on april   and received comments from the office of device evaluation ode on november  requesting that staar submit an amended application 
in subsequent discussion the ode indicated that it expects to submit the amended application to review by the fda ophthalmic devices panel 
as of the date of this report  staar is preparing an amendment to the ticl application addressing the ode comments 
generating further growth of the icl and ticl in international markets 
the icl and ticl are sold in more than countries 
international sales of refractive implants have continued a steady rate of growth  increasing approximately in over the preceding year 
staar believes that the international market for its refractive products has the potential for further growth  both through the introduction of the icl and ticl in new territories and expanded market share in existing territories 
in recent periods staar has received the majority of its revenue from international markets  and sales of icls have represented an increasing share of that revenue 
staar received approval for the icl in china on july  and we are awaiting approval of the ticl there as well 
we also continue to seek new approvals for the icl and ticl in other countries  but these approvals are at the discretion of the local authorities 
reversing the decline in us market share for our core cataract product lines by intensifying selling efforts and renewing and refining our product offering through enhanced r d 
during the last several years staar has experienced a decline in us sales of iols 
staar s management believes the decline principally resulted from the slow pace of cataract product improvement and enhancement during a period when we had to devote most of our research and development resources to introducing the icl and to resolving the regulatory and compliance issues raised by the fda  and the harm to our reputation from warning letters and other correspondence with the fda during and staar seeks to reverse the decline in its domestic cataract market share by the introduction of enhanced design iols and improved delivery systems in and the completion in of initiatives to revamp staar s systems of regulatory compliance and quality management permitted staar to shift resources back to product development 
in particular  staar has focused on the following projects intended to expand and improve our cataract product offering a collamer toric iol  new collamer iol models featuring an aspheric optic design  in a three piece configuration  new silicone iol models featuring aspheric optics and a squared edge configuration  enhancements to the injector system for our three piece collamer iol to improve delivery  an all new injector system for the three piece collamer iol  
table of contents a micro incision injector for the one piece collamer iol  and development of a preloaded injector system for our new silicone aspheric iols 
staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risk of unexpected delays 
staar also believes that expanding the us market for the icl should also improve the selling environment for staar s cataract products  especially cataract lenses made of the same biocompatible collamer material used in the icl 
staar intends that the split of its sales and marketing department will help it take advantage of the opportunities presented by the introduction of new cataract products and the improved selling environment for staar s products created by the icl 
on january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a ruling that allows cataract patients receiving reimbursement by medicare to choose a lens that also corrects astigmatism 
under the ruling  patients may elect to pay a premium for the correction of pre existing astigmatism  while medicare provides the customary reimbursement for cataract surgery 
staar expects its silicone toric iol  currently one of two iols approved for sale in the us for treatment of cataracts and astigmatism  to be covered by the cms ruling 
staar believes that the cms ruling will increase the profitability of its sales of toric iols and generate greater interest in implanting the product 
in addition  staar expects to introduce a toric iol made of its proprietary collamer material  which would also likely fall under the cms ruling and compete with our competitor s acrylic model 
staar cannot estimate the increased revenue that may result from the cms ruling at this time 
while staar s us cataract product sales  which include accessory products such as surgery packs and phacoemulsification equipment  declined during  us cataract product sales for the fourth quarter of increased compared with the same period in despite the decline in total us cataract sales for the full year  the fourth quarter sales in is a marked improvement compared with the first three quarters of  which have improved from down in the first quarter of when compared to their respective periods in to reverse the decline in us iol sales  staar must overcome several short and long term challenges  including overcoming reputational harm from the fda s past findings of compliance deficiencies  successfully completing planned development projects  and organizing and managing a combined direct and independent sales force 
we cannot ensure that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
maintaining our focus on regulatory compliance and continuous quality improvement 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  staar s manufacturing processes and facilities are regulated by the fda 
we also must satisfy the requirements of the international standards organization iso to maintain approval to sell products in the european community and other regions 
failure to demonstrate substantial compliance with fda regulations can result in enforcement actions that terminate  suspend or severely restrict the ability to continue manufacturing and selling medical devices 
between december  and july   staar received warning letters  form inspectional observations and other correspondence from the fda indicating deficiencies in staar s compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations and warning of possible enforcement action 
in response  staar implemented numerous improvements to its quality system 
among other things  staar developed a global quality systems action plan  which has been continuously updated since its adoption in april   and took steps to emphasize a focus on compliance throughout the organization 
the fda s most recent general quality inspections of staar s facilities were a post market inspection of the monrovia  california and aliso viejo  california facilities between august  and august   and a post market inspection of the nidau  switzerland facilities between september and september  these inspections resulted in no observations of noncompliance 
based in part on these inspections and the fda inspections conducted in  staar believes that it is substantially in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations 
nevertheless  the fda s past findings of compliance deficiencies have harmed our reputation in the ophthalmic industry and affected our product sales 
staar s ability to continue its us business depends on the continuous improvement of its quality systems and its ability to demonstrate compliance with fda regulations 
accordingly  for the foreseeable future staar s 
table of contents management expects its strategy to include devoting significant resources and attention to strict regulatory compliance and continuous improvement in quality 
in keeping with its compliance strategy  staar hired rob lally to serve as vice president  quality assurance and regulatory affairs on october  prior to joining staar  mr 
lally was most recently the director of international regulatory affairs at johnson johnson vision care in florida 
mr 
lally previously served as head of the medical devices sector of the british standards institution  the national standards body of the united kingdom responsible for independent certification of a variety of systems and products 
prior to this  he was a senior consultant at quintiles  a global quality and regulatory consulting firm 
mr 
lally also served as general manager  quality and certification at amtac laboratories  a leading european union notified body where he managed the medical device and drug sector 
on march   the bioresearch monitoring program of the fda office of regulatory affairs bimo concluded a routine audit of the company s clinical trial records as a sponsor of biomedical research in connection with the company s supplemental pre market approval application for the ticl 
at the conclusion of the audit the company received eight inspectional observations on fda form noting noncompliance with regulations 
the company is preparing its response to the inspectional observations and expects to address the concerns raised by bimo through voluntary corrective actions 
most of the observed instances of non compliance took place during the period and the company expects to show that some of these have already been addressed by corrective actions made in response to bimo s observations of december  in connection with the company s application for the icl 
the company does not believe that the inspectional observations affect the integrity of the toric clinical study 
however  the determination of whether the inspectional observations affect the use of the toric clinical study in staar s pending toric application will be at the discretion of the ode 
obtaining fda approval of medical devices is never certain 
financing strategy while staar s international business generates positive cash flow and of staar s revenue  staar has reported losses on a consolidated basis over the last several years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
during the last three years staar has secured additional capital to sustain operations through private sales of equity securities  exercise of options  the repayment of directors notes and debt financing 
staar s management believes that in the near term its best prospect for returning its us and consolidated operations to profitability is achieving significant us sales of the icl 
in the longer term staar seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
nevertheless  success of these strategies is not assured and  even if successful  staar is not likely to achieve positive cash flow on a consolidated basis during fiscal to provide additional sources of available working capital  staar entered into two debt financing arrangements in and on march   staar entered into a loan arrangement with broadwood partners  lp broadwood 
pursuant to a promissory note the note between staar and broadwood  broadwood loaned million to staar 
the note has a term of three years and bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly 
the note is not secured by any collateral  may be pre paid by staar at any time without penalty  and is not subject to covenants based on financial performance or financial condition except for insolvency 
as additional consideration for the loan staar also entered into a warrant agreement the warrant agreement with broadwood granting the right to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  exercisable for a period of six years 
the note also provides that so long as a principal balance remains outstanding on the note staar will grant additional warrants each quarter on the same terms as the warrant agreement 
the warrant agreement provides that staar will register the stock for resale with the sec 
based on publicly available information filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec  on the date of the transaction broadwood partners lp beneficially owned  shares of the company s common stock  comprising of the company s common stock as of march   and neal bradsher  president of broadwood partners  lp  
table of contents may have been deemed to beneficially own  shares of the company s common stock  comprising of the company s common stock as of that date 
on june  staar signed a credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank for a revolving credit facility 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of of eligible accounts receivable with a maximum of million  carries an interest rate of prime plus  and is secured by substantially all of the assets of staar s us operations 
the term of the agreement is three years and it contains certain financial covenants relating to minimum calculated net worth  net loss  liquidity and restrictions on company investments or loans to affiliates and investments in capital expenditures  which only apply if the company borrows and or maintains an outstanding advance 
no borrowings were outstanding as of december  however  as staar does not satisfy minimum financial covenants in its us operations that are a condition to borrowing  no borrowings are available 
in addition  staar s swiss subsidiary has  in borrowing availability under its million line of credit for use in swiss operations 
staar may seek additional debt or equity financing to provide working capital  finance new business initiatives  expand its business or make acquisitions 
because of our history of losses  our ability to obtain adequate financing on satisfactory terms is limited 
staar s cash resources are discussed in further detail under the caption liquidity and capital resources below 
investigation of fraud at domilens gmbh domilens gmbh is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of staar surgical company based in hamburg  germany 
it distributes ophthalmic products made by both staar and other manufacturers 
during fiscal year domilens reported sales of million 
on january   guenther roepstorff  president of domilens  notified staar he had admitted to the german federal ministry of finance that without staar s knowledge he had diverted property of domilens to a company under his control over a four year period between and mr 
roepstorff made this admission in connection with an audit conducted by the ministry in  which examined the financial records of mr 
roepstorff  domilens and the company to which he owned and diverted the property  equimed gmbh currently known as eyemaxx gmbh  covering the four year period 
immediately after learning these facts staar commenced an internal investigation of domilens 
on january   the audit committee of staar s board of directors engaged pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc to conduct a forensic audit in connection with the investigation by legal counsel 
the committee subsequently engaged the law firm of taylor wessing  through its hamburg office  as independent german legal counsel 
the investigation included a comprehensive forensic review of the accounting records  documents and electronic records of domilens and interviews of current employees and mr 
roepstorff 
on march   the audit committee of the board of directors of staar surgical company received pwc s final report 
key findings 
pwc investigated instances of misappropriation of corporate assets by mr 
roepstorff between and areas of fraudulent activity investigated by pwc included diversions of sales of iols and equipment to equimed gmbh  payments to mr 
roepstorff disguised as prepayments to suppliers and unauthorized borrowing 
it is estimated that from through these activities diverted assets having a book value of approximately  and resulted in unreported proceeds to equimed and mr 
roepstorff of approximately pwc identified mr 
roepstorff s ability to override the internal controls implemented by staar as a key factor in his ability to accomplish fraudulent transactions and avoid detection 
in particular  they found that even after staar had acquired full control of domilens and implemented further oversight he continued to run the company as his own and had a dominant presence with employees 
pwc found evidence that  notwithstanding the requirements of staar s code of ethics  some domilens employees had been aware of improper activities by mr 
roepstorff and in some instances cooperated in documenting the activities in a manner that aided concealment 
however  there is no evidence that other employees received any portion of the diverted assets or other payment for cooperation 

table of contents pwc also identified inadequate oversight of domilens by staar ag and inadequate management oversight by staar as significant factors enabling mr 
roepstorff to accomplish his actions 
pwc has determined that a greater degree of scrutiny would have likely led to earlier detection of irregularities at domilens 
impact on financial statements 
domilens financial results are consolidated into the audited financial statements of staar 
staar has reviewed its historical financial statements  and has determined that properly accounting for past transactions in domilens in light of the information provided by pwc s investigation did not result in a material change in staar s reported results of operations or reported financial condition for historical periods 
staar has determined that the events at domilens revealed a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting 
see item a 
controls and procedures management report on internal control over financial reporting 
expenses related to domilens irregularities 
it is currently estimated that the fees and reimbursable expenses of advisors incurred by staar in connection with the investigation will total approximately  which will be recorded in fiscal year in addition  staar has reserved approximately  against additional taxes that may be assessed for unreported sales  but will seek to reduce that amount in discussions with the german ministry of finance 
the estimated tax liability was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year other actions 
staar suspended all of mr 
roespstorff s duties as president on january  he voluntarily resigned from his employment with domilens on january  staar will provide all of domilens employees further training in their duties as employees and in staar s code of ethics 
in addition  based on the advice of german counsel  the degree of individual culpability and other factors  staar may take other disciplinary actions  including possible termination of employees or monitoring of selected employees during a probationary period 
other recent highlights growth in international sales of visian icls and preloaded silicone iols 
the decline in the us cataract business during was offset in part by a increase in international sales of the icl and ticl 
in addition  the preloaded silicone iol injector system developed with our joint venture partner canon staar experienced strong sales in international markets  growing for the year 
this growth in the business contributed to an increase in international sales of for fiscal compared with job actions by doctors in germany 
staar receives significant revenue from its german subsidiary  domilens gmbh  a distributor of ophthalmic products manufactured by staar and other manufacturers 
as is the case in most countries  purchases of domilens cataract related products in germany depend on government reimbursement of cataract surgery 
germany has recently made a number of cost cutting changes in its medical reimbursement policies  including a requirement that government employed surgeons reduce the number of cataract surgeries performed to below rates 
in response to these changes in reimbursement policies  many medical doctors throughout germany initiated job actions during the first and second quarters of such as strikes or slow downs in which doctors provided only the most essential services to patients 
while doctors and state run and university clinics reached a settlement in june  strikes continue at city run hospitals throughout germany during the third quarter  but were ultimately resolved 
these job actions  and the mandatory reduction in the number of cataract procedures  caused a significant reduction in ophthalmic surgeries and reduced sales of distributed products by domilens  which during declined compared to  significantly impacting international and global sales of cataract product for the year 
however  fourth quarter sales in germany of improved over the fourth quarter of by indicating we may have seen the worst in this market 
competition with multifocal iols 
the us iol market continues to be affected by sales of multifocal and accommodating lenses resulting from a ruling of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the ruling permits medicare covered cataract patients to receive more highly priced multifocal or accommodating iols sometimes referred to as presbyopic lenses by paying only the additional cost of the lens and surgical procedure while still receiving reimbursement for the basic cost of cataract surgery and a monofocal iol 
this has increased the number of patients to whom surgeons offer the alternative of the higher priced lenses 
while staar s 
table of contents us cataract product sales increased in the first  second  and fourth quarters of over the preceding quarter  remained flat in the third quarter of compared to the same period in  sales volume might have been greater were it not for increased sales of multifocal and accommodative lenses 
in january  the cms made a similar ruling  that allows a medicare patient to pay a premium for a lens that also corrects astigmatism 
staar expects this ruling will result in increased sales revenue from its silicone toric iols  currently one of only two lenses of this type in the us market  and will enhance the market for a collamer toric iol currently in development 
nevertheless  with the help of the cms ruling  presbyopic lenses are expected to claim a share of the cataract market in the future  and staar does not offer a lens of this type 
seasonality 
we generally experience lower sales during the third quarter due to the effect of summer vacations on elective procedures 
in particular  because sales activity in europe drops dramatically in the summer months  and european sales have recently accounted for a greater proportion of our total sales  this seasonal variation in our results has become even more pronounced 
foreign currency fluctuations 
our products are sold in approximately countries 
during fiscal year  sales from international operations represented of total sales 
the results of operations and the financial position of certain of our offshore operations are reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements  exposing us to currency translation risk 
for fiscal year  changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales and marketing and selling expenses 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin increased to for fiscal year  compared with in the improvement in gross profit from generally resulted from increased volume of higher margin icls in the us  partially offset by an obsolescence charge  against certain iol inventory in anticipation of new product launches in and higher iol and icl unit costs due to lower manufacturing volumes 
research and development 
we spent approximately of our sales on research and development which includes regulatory and quality assurance expenses during fiscal  and we expect to spend approximately of our sales on an annual basis in the future 
cash flow 
we exited the year with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted short term investments compared with million at december  we used approximately million for operating activities during fiscal  which is above the million used during fiscal however  cash used in operating activities in  which was at its highest level for the year in the first quarter of when the icl was first introduced in the us market  declined in each of the three subsequent quarters 
purchases of property and equipment were approximately  during the year we received approximately million in proceeds from stock options and million in payments on notes from a former director 
as a result of these proceeds  the net cash usage see liquidity and capital resourses non gaap measures for fiscal was million  a improvement over the million reported for fiscal during we obtained additional sources of financing such as the million wells fargo loc and million in lease financing and we expect to continue to identify alternative sources of liquidity to support operations 
the company expects to reduce and and ultimately reverse its operating losses and negative cash flows as icl sales reach targeted levels and the ticl is approved in the us in addition  we will continue to pursue cost savings opportunities  wherever possible  to conserve cash

the company has lost increasing market share in the us over the last several years as it has not kept pace with the competition in introducing new and enhanced cataracts products due to the company s focus on bringing the visian icl to the us market 
us sales of the visian icl  which was launched in the us in february  were  for fiscal the company expects to grow icl sales and reverse declining cataract sales trends and regain market share as it continues the process of training icl surgeons and introduces enhanced cataract products to the market in and beyond 
international net sales for fiscal were  an increase of compared with fiscal and were impacted by a increase in refractive product sales but partially offset by a decline of in cataract product sales 
the decline in international cataract sales is primarily due to the impact in of doctor strikes in germany  one of staar s largest cataract sales markets 
the labor disputes were settled in and the company believes the declining cataract sales trends in germany will reverse in during fiscal  global sales of icls and ticls grew to  compared with  in fiscal total refractive sales during fiscal grew to  compared with  in fiscal due to the launch of the icl in the us and increased international icl sales in the company expects continued growth in sales  both in the us and internationally  as the icl and ticl gain broader acceptance and new cataract products are introduced 

table of contents gross profit margin gross profit margin for the full year was compared with for gross profit for was impacted by obsolescence charges of  for certain iol inventory in anticipation of new product launches in and to a lesser degree slower moving diopters of other lenses 
management intends to mitigate the risk of write off of this and other product but felt it prudent to take this action as cannibalization of existing product is likely as new products roll out 
this charge reduced gross profit margin by approximately 
excluding this charge  gross profit margin would have increased to  a percentage point improvement compared with standard margin  which represents the margin associated with the direct costs of production and excludes other cost of sales  for was  an increase of compared with iol margins for the year decreased to  due to an overall decrease in average selling prices  a decrease in iol unit volume  and a increase in average unit costs 
icl margins increased to due to the launch of the product in the us where the company realized margins of approximately 
international icl ticl margins at were down from the previous year due to higher costs 
margins on all other products decreased due to higher costs 
for  other cost of sales was million  an increase of  compared with the increase in other cost of sales is due to the aforementioned inventory reserves and increased royalties  partially offset by a decrease in freight and other costs 
the company expects gross profit margin to increase as sales of icls become a larger percentage of overall revenue  us cataract sales continue to grow and as enhanced cataract products are delivered to the market 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased or  over fiscal excluding the  impact of fas r for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal as a result of general cost increases 
the company does not expect significant increases in general and administrative expenses in marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for fiscal increased or  compared with fiscal excluding the  impact of fas r for fiscal  marketing and selling expenses increased in fiscal the increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal primarily resulted from increased costs to support the roll out of the company s refractive products in new territories  including the us  and increased commissions 
the company expects sales and marketing expense to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales over but increase in dollars due to increased commissions in the us on higher sales 
research and development research and development expenses  including regulatory and clinical expenses  for fiscal increased or  compared with fiscal excluding the impact of the implementation of fas r  which was  for fiscal  research and development expenses increased 
the increase in research and development expenses  excluding the impact of the adoption of fas r  is due to costs associated with new product development and ticl regulatory and fda submission costs 
the company expects to spend approximately of revenues in on its research and development activities 
note reserves reversals during  the company settled the last of its notes receivable from former directors and officers totaling  including accrued interest for a cash payment of  and proceeds from the sale of  shares of pledged company stock of  the deficiency on the notes was applied against reserves recorded against the notes in and and  of excess reserves was reversed during fiscal 
table of contents other income expense  net other income  net for fiscal was  compared to fiscal when it was  the principal reasons for the decrease in other income are due to  of exchange losses recorded during the year versus  of exchange gains recorded during fiscal  decreased interest income due to decreased cash balances  increased interest expense due to lease financing obtained in  and a decrease in earnings from the company s joint venture and other miscellaneous income decreases 
income taxes the company recorded income taxes of million for fiscal and million for fiscal  based on the income of the company s german subsidiary including taxes of approximately  that were accrued based on the results of a tax audit of the german subsidiary by the german tax authorities  see overview investigation of fraud at domilens gmbh 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues net sales for the years ended fiscal and december  fiscal were million and million  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales for fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in product sales was a decrease in us cataract product sales  both in average selling prices and volumes  due to i increasing concerns in the marketplace regarding the company s long unresolved compliance issues with the fda  ii the company s failure to match competitors improvements to iol technology  iii although subsequently withdrawn  the receipt of a going concern qualification from the company s auditors  iv our sales representatives loss of effective selling time as a result of the foregoing  v a supplier recall of viscoelastic which is often bundled with iols  and vi the cms ruling that permits medicare covered cataract patients to receive higher cost multifocal iols by paying only the additional cost of the lens and surgical procedure while still receiving reimbursement for the basic cost of cataract surgery and a monofocal iol 
the decreases in us cataract product sales were partially offset by a increase in sales of the company s visian tm icl icl and visian tm toric icl ticl in international markets  and an increase in sales of preloaded iols in international markets 
gross profit gross profit margin decreased to of revenues for fiscal  from of revenues for fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit margin were higher unit costs due to the allocation of fixed overhead across fewer units produced  lower overall average selling prices of iols  and a continued shift in geographical and product mix 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or  over fiscal primarily due to increased insurance premiums and increased professional fees  particularly legal and settlement fees associated with the class action lawsuit 
marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal primarily as a result of cost reduction measures taken during and a decrease in us commissions due to decreased cataract product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the fiscal  decreased  or  compared to fiscal  as anticipated  because significant consulting costs were incurred in the previous year in preparation for fda audits in the company s nidau  switzerland and monrovia  california facilities 

table of contents note reserves reversals other charges for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded additional reserves totaling  against promissory notes of a former director of the company 
aggregate principal and accrued interest owed to the company under the notes was million as of december   against which the company has reserved a total of million 
the former director is in default under the notes and a related forbearance agreement with the company  but has recently affirmed his obligation to pay the full principal and interest under the notes 
on these events  the company re evaluated its likelihood of collecting on the notes and re examined the collateral for the notes  which consists of a pledge of  shares of the company s common stock the pledged shares and a second mortgage on a home in florida 
during the third quarter of  the company was advised that its collateral may be compromised with respect to the second mortgage 
accordingly  the company increased its reserve on the notes to reflect the status of the collateral 
other income expense  net other income  net for fiscal was  compared to fiscal when it was expense of  the principal reasons for the increase in other income are due to  of exchange gains recorded during the year versus  of exchange losses recorded during fiscal  increased interest income due to higher cash balances and interest rates  and  in earnings from the company s joint venture versus  of losses recorded during fiscal income taxes the company recorded income taxes of million for fiscal and million for fiscal  primarily based on the income of the company s german subsidiary

table of contents on march  the company executed a million note with broadwood partners  lp 
the obligation has been excluded from the table because it was not outstanding at december  while the company s international business generates positive cash flow and represents approximately of consolidated net sales  the company has reported losses on a consolidated basis for several years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
during these years the company has secured additional capital to sustain operations through private sales of equity securities 
the company believes that in the near term its best prospect for returning its us and consolidated operations to profitability is through the growth in sales of the icl in the us combined with continued growth in international markets 
in the longer term the company seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
nevertheless  success of these strategies is not assured and  even if successful  the company is not likely to achieve positive cash flow on a consolidated basis during fiscal the company believes that as a result of its debt financings  along with expected cash from operations  it currently has sufficient cash to meet its funding requirements at least through the first quarter of however  given its history of losses and negative cash flows  it is possible that the company will find it necessary to supplement these sources of capital with additional financing to sustain operations until the company returns to profitability 
the credit facilities are subject to various financial covenants and if our losses continue  we risk defaulting on the terms of our credit facilities 
our limited borrowing capacity could cause a shortfall in working capital or prevent us from making expenditures to expand or enhance our business 
a default on any of our loan agreements could cause our long term obligations to be accelerated  make further borrowing difficult and jeopardize our ability to continue operations 
if the company is unable to rely solely on existing debt financing and is unable to obtain additional debt financing  the company may find it necessary to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of equity or debt securities 
the company has filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which provides for the public offering and sale of up to million in debt or equity securities pursuant to the securities act of  as amended 
the registration statement became effective on august  the company is not obligated to sell any amount of securities under the registration statement  and as of the date of this report it has not entered into any commitment to do so 
notwithstanding the availability of shelf registration  the company s ability to raise financing through sales of securities depends on general market conditions and the demand for staar s common stock or debt securities 
the conditions prevailing at the time the company seeks to raise capital may prevent it from selling securities under the shelf registration on favorable terms  or at all 
if our common stock has a low market price at a time when we sell equity securities  our existing shareholders could experience substantial dilution 
an inability to secure additional financing could limit our ability to expand our business 
if we fail to achieve profitability and cannot secure adequate funding  our ability to continue operations would be in jeopardy 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  which will largely depend on the success of the icl  proceeds from option exercises  borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and proceeds from the private placement of common stock 
any withdrawal of support from its banks could have serious consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity also depends  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s short term funding 
changes in the market price of our common stock affect the value of our outstanding options  and lower market prices could reduce our expected revenue from option exercises 
the business of the company is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are beyond its control  including  but not limited to  those set forth above and in the other reports filed by the company with the securities

such risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
non gaap measures the following financial measures included below are not prepared in accordance with gaap cash usage and standard margin 
a reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures is presented as a table below 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
cash usage the cash usage financial measure is not prepared in conformity with gaap and excludes the purchase and sale of short term investments from cash used in investing activities and net proceeds from private placement from cash provided by financing activities 
cash usage is not a measurement of liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash used in investing activities  cash provided by financing activities  or the change in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets and may not be comparable with cash usage as defined by other companies

the company s standard margin for was  an increase of compared with fiscal year ended december  december  gross profit margin add distribution costs add royalty expense add inventory provisions add all other cost of sales standard margin management believes cash usage and standard margin financial information provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding the items described above in order to show the cash usage and standard margin from normal operations 
staar believes that this financial information is useful to our management and investors in assessing staar s historical performance and liquidity and when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
the company recognizes revenue when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer 
the company s products are marketed to ophthalmic surgeons  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers or vision centers  and distributors 
iols may be offered to surgeons and hospitals on a consignment basis 
in accordance with sab  the company recognizes revenue for consignment inventory when the iol is implanted during surgery and not upon shipment to the surgeon 
the company believes its revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances 
see note accounting policies for a further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policy 
the company generally permits returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by the company  and in good condition 
the company provides allowances for returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within the company s expectations  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of historical return experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for returns 
the company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by the company s review of its customers current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
the company considers all available information in its assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors in accordance with sfas r and the issuance of stock options and warrants for services from non employees in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  by estimating the fair value of options and warrants issued using the black 
table of contents scholes pricing model 
this model s calculations include the exercise price  the market price of shares on grant date  risk free interest rates  expected life of the option or warrant  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements for share based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the valuation allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet 
net increases to the valuation allowance were   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to defend its positions 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if the company prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
the company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of its inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  the company determined that its inventory was overvalued  it would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company determined that its inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and the company would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same loss rates that it has in the past 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and its reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in reviewing for impairment  the company compares the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an assessment was completed under the guidance of sfas no 
for the year ended december   and no impairment was identified 
see note accounting policies for a further discussion of sfas no 
goodwill 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life and was previously amortized on a straight line basis over the periods benefited  is no longer amortized to earnings  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
as provided under sfas no 
 an annual assessment was completed for the year ended december   and no impairment was identified 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
see note accounting policies for a further discussion of sfas no 
patents and licenses 
the company also has other intangible assets consisting of patents and licenses  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of december  amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are based on legal and contractual provisions  and range from to years 
the company reviews patents and licenses for impairment in the same assessment discussed above in the discussion above regarding impairment of long lived assets 
no impairment was identified during the review completed in the fourth quarter of foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years had adversely affected the company s ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which would affect the company s operating results 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions to offset changes in currency 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years

eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements  which specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured 
additionally  this guidance further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable gaap without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment arrangement 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides that companies may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable some companies to reduce the variability in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
companies may elect fair value measurement when an eligible asset or liability is initially recognized or when an event  such as a business combination  triggers a new basis of accounting for that asset or liability 
the election is irrevocable for every contract chosen to be measured at fair value and must be applied to an entire contract  not to only specified risks  specific cash flows  or portions of that contract 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  retrospective application is not allowed 
companies may adopt sfas as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november  if the choice to adopt early is made after sfas has been issued and within days of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and the entity has not issued gaap financial statements for any interim period of the fiscal year that includes the early adoption date 
companies are permitted to elect fair value measurement for any eligible item within sfas s scope at the date they initially adopt sfas the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the current carrying amount of the assets and liabilities for which a company elects fair value measurement is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption 
companies that adopt sfas early must also adopt all of sfas s requirements at the early adoption date 
we are assessing the impact of adopting sfas and currently do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
management does not believe that these market risks are 
table of contents material to the results of operations or cash flows of the company  and  accordingly  does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments 
interest rate risk 
our million of debt is based on the borrowings of our international subsidiaries 
the majority of our international borrowings bear an interest rate that is linked to swiss market conditions and  thus  our interest rate expense will fluctuate with changes in those conditions 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately  foreign currency risk 
our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide primarily  the euro and australian dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
additionally  as of december   all of our debt is denominated in swiss francs and as such  we are subject to fluctuations of the swiss franc as compared to the us dollar in converting the value of the debt to us dollars 
the us dollar value of the debt is increased by a weaker dollar and decreased by a stronger dollar relative to the swiss franc 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks include those set forth in item a 
risk factors
