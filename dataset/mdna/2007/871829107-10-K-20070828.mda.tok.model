accounting pronouncement eitf see below negatively impacted sales growth in fiscal by and also affects the comparison of gross margins  operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the periods 
gross margins as a percentage of sales were for fiscal and fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal decreased from the prior year  reflecting efficiencies in our operating activities 
decreases in pension and share based compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies were largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives

overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  hotel supply operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to internationally located chain restaurants 
we estimate that we serve about of an approximately billion annual market that includes foodservice market and hotel amenity  furniture and textile market both in the united states and canada 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food prepared away from home  market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level 
this share grew from about in to about in and has not changed materially since that time 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and  in turn  can impact our sales 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 
we intend to continue to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth  brand management  productivity gains  sales force effectiveness and supply chain management 
strategic business initiatives in fiscal  our executive team  with the approval of the board of directors  established a strategy team to examine many aspects of our businesses with an emphasis on strategic focus areas which would help us achieve our long term vision of becoming the global leader of the efficient  multi temperature food product value chain 
during fiscal  we began to move from identifying strategic opportunities and developing a strategy process to implementing the initiatives that came from that process 
near the end of the fiscal year  we announced new responsibilities for several executives as we integrated the strategy teams and their initiatives into our business 
a strategic management function will remain in place to help put strategic business initiatives into action and continue to refine and develop corporate strategy 
the following areas generally comprise the initiatives that will serve as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a sustainable future 
each area is staffed with sysco associates focused on the following sourcing and national supply chain focuses on lowering our cost of goods sold by leveraging sysco s purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end to end view of our supply chain 
we expect our national supply chain project to lower inventory  operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
integrated delivery focuses on standardized processes to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation and manage energy consumption to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers 
demand explores and implements initiatives to better understand and more profitably sell to and service sysco s customers  including better tools and techniques for selling 
organizational capabilities works to align management reporting  information technology systems and performance measures with the business initiatives 
a major component of our national supply chain project entails the use of redistribution centers rdcs 
the first rdc  the northeast rdc located in front royal  virginia  opened during the third quarter of fiscal in january  we completed the purchase of land in alachua  florida for the future site of our second rdc  which will service our five broadline operating companies in florida 
construction of the building site is in progress and this facility is expected to be operational in fiscal in march  we purchased the site for construction of a third rdc in hamlet  indiana 

table of contents we will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to help us grow by leveraging our market leadership position to continuously improve how our associates buy  handle and market products for our customers 
our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in north america 
we are currently working to expand our import and export business 
we will also continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities and stay abreast of international acquisition opportunities 
accounting changes as of june   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
the recognition provision requires an employer to recognize a plan s funded status in its statement of financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement benefit plan s funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of june  was a decrease in prepaid pension cost of  a decrease in other assets of  an increase in accrued expenses of  a decrease in long term deferred taxes of  an increase in other long term liabilities of  and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of  the adoption of sfas s recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  the adoption has no effect on our consolidated results of operations for fiscal  or for any prior year presented  and it will not affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 
sfas also has a measurement date provision  which is a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position  effective for fiscal years ending after december  in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year end to may st to assist us in meeting accelerated sec filing dates 
as a result of this change  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 
with the issuance of sfas  we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time 
as a result  beginning in fiscal  the measurement date will return to correspond with our fiscal year end 
we have performed measurements as of may  and june  of our plan assets and benefit obligations 
we will record a charge to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately  net of tax  for the impact of the cumulative difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates 
we will also record a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately  net of tax  for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet recognition provision between the two measurement dates 
in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting pronouncement eitf accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  eitf 
the accounting standard requires certain transactions  where inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer as defined  to be presented in the income statement on a net basis 
this situation primarily arises for sysco when a customer has a proprietary item which they have either manufactured or sourced  but they require our distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to their locations 
the application of this standard requires sales and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the application of this standard 
we adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have applied it to similar transactions prospectively 
prior period sales and cost of sales have not been restated 
therefore  the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins  operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the non comparable periods is affected 
the impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced by  for the fourth quarter of fiscal and  for the first weeks of fiscal  without a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods 
beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales are reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated 
our consolidated results of operations for fiscal include incremental share based compensation cost over what would have been recorded had the company continued to account for share based compensation under apb of   net of tax 
our consolidated results of operations for all future periods will include share based compensation cost recorded in accordance with sfas r

estimated product cost increases were during fiscal as compared to during fiscal we believe that our continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers and the continued investment in increasing the number of customer contact personnel contributed to the sales growth in fiscal and the number of customer contact personnel increased during fiscal and during fiscal in addition  we believe fiscal sales growth was aided by a declining rate of product cost increases experienced throughout the year  which lessened the overall gross margin pressures and contributed to underlying unit growth 

table of contents industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below fresh and frozen meats canned and dry products frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other poultry dairy products fresh produce paper and disposables seafood beverage products janitorial products equipment and smallwares medical supplies a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other gross margins gross margins as a percentage of sales were for fiscal and fiscal the impact of eitf contributed a increase to gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal over fiscal estimated product cost increases  an internal measure of inflation  were for fiscal the rate of product cost rose throughout the year  ending at an estimated for the fourth quarter 
product cost increases result in reduced gross margins as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year  as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollars base 
however  the company was able to manage this inflationary environment well resulting in gross profit dollars increasing for the year 
gross margins as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the adoption of eitf in the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to the increase in gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal over fiscal management believes that the remaining gross margin increase as a percentage of sales was aided by several factors  including low product cost inflation and effective merchandising 
while we can not predict if product cost inflation will continue in future periods  in general  we believe prolonged periods of high inflation may have a negative impact on our customers and as a result  on our sales  gross margins and earnings 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling  administrative and occupancy expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the impact of eitf increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales by for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of sales  prior to the effect of the impact of eitf  was primarily due to efficiencies obtained at the operating company level 
decreases in pension and share based compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies were largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives 
share based compensation expense decreased  in fiscal over the prior year  due primarily to the completion of expense recognition in fiscal of a significant number of options granted in fiscal net pension costs decreased  in fiscal over the prior year  due primarily to the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal pension costs 

table of contents operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of  in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value 
this compared to the recognition of a gain of  in fiscal due primarily to improved operating results  the non stock portion of management incentive bonus accruals increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal when our performance did not satisfy the criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers 
investments in strategic business initiatives increased  in fiscal over the prior year 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the impact of eitf for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales by for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales included incremental share based compensation  increased fuel costs  increased pension costs and increased expenses associated with the national supply chain project  partially offset by reduced management incentive bonus accruals 
share based compensation expense increased  in fiscal over the prior year  resulting from incremental expense incurred due to the adoption of sfas r see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
fuel costs increased  in fiscal over the prior year 
net pension costs increased  in fiscal over the prior year 
operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of  in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value  as compared to a gain of  in fiscal the non stock portion of various management incentive bonus accruals decreased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal net pension costs in fiscal are expected to decrease by approximately  due primarily to the funding status and asset performance of the qualified pension plan 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels 
the increase in interest expense of  in fiscal over fiscal was due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels 
in fiscal  commercial paper and short term bank borrowing rates increased over the prior year 
effective borrowing rates on long term debt also increased over fiscal in fiscal  effective borrowing rates on long term debt were lowered through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
higher overall borrowing levels in fiscal over fiscal were a result of the level of share repurchases  increased working capital requirements driven primarily by sales growth and continued capital investments in the form of additions to plant and equipment and acquisitions of new businesses 
other  net changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
the increase in fiscal over the prior year is primarily due to a gain of approximately  on the sale of land 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower share based compensation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal over fiscal was a result of increased share based compensation expense in fiscal due to the adoption of sfas r and certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal  which are discussed in note  share based compensation  and note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal over fiscal net earnings decreased in fiscal over fiscal the changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily to the factors discussed above as well as the impact on the comparisons due to the fiscal accounting change discussed below 
in the first quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefits  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 

table of contents earnings per share basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
these increases were due primary to the result of factors discussed above 
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
these decreases were due primarily to the result of factors discussed above  partially offset by a net reduction in shares outstanding 
the net reduction in average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share is primarily due to share repurchases 
the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to share repurchases  the exclusion of certain options from the diluted share calculation due to their anti dilutive effect and a modification of the treasury stock method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of stock options as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
this modification results in lower diluted shares outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances under the employees stock purchase plan

the increase in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to increased share based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r

table of contents the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat  specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal marketing associate served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal was primarily due to increases in sales  gross margin dollar increases and effective expense management

sygma segment sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the impact of eitf reduced sales growth by  or  for fiscal compared to a  reduction for fiscal sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of eitf acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal fiscal growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to increased sales at existing locations as well as new locations added by those customers 
in addition  certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations  contributing to the sales increase 
the increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal was due to several factors  including sales growth  increased margins and improved operating efficiencies  partially offset by costs of labor and auto liability related expenses 
in addition  the transfer of customers from broadline operations referred to above also contributed to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the adoption of eitf in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced sales growth in fiscal by 
acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal fiscal growth was due primarily to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers  each of which temporarily increases sygma s cost to service the customers 
in addition  certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations  contributing to the sales increase 
the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal was due to several factors 
certain of sygma s customers experienced a slowdown in their business 
this in turn resulted in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop 
in addition  sygma experienced increased fuel costs  startup costs related to new facilities  costs incurred on information systems projects and increased workers compensation costs 
liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada 
we intend to continue to expand our market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts and acquisitions 
we also strive to increase the effectiveness of our customer contact personnel and our consolidated buying programs  as well as the productivity of our warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional debt 
our share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization 
we target a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between and 
the ratio may exceed the target range 
table of contents from time to time  due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities  and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
this ratio was and as of june  and july   respectively 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  as well as the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs  bank lines of credit  debt shelf registration and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
operating activities we generated  in cash flow from operations in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal increases in our cash flow from operations are primarily due to increased earnings offset by investments in working capital 
cash flow from operations in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases in accounts receivable balances  offset by an increase in accounts payable balances 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales growth 
the accounts payable balances did not increase at the same rate as inventory increases 
accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors  including changes in product mix  cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors due to the use of more efficient electronic payment methods 
accrued expenses increased  during fiscal  increased  during fiscal  and decreased  during fiscal the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to increased accruals for current year incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over the prior year 
the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was related to various miscellaneous accruals 
the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to that year 
also affecting the increase in accrued expenses and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets during fiscal was the recording of the product liability claim of  and corresponding receivable of  cash flow from operations was not negatively affected  as these items mostly offset 
see further discussion of the product liability claim under other considerations 
other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  increased  during fiscal  decreased  in fiscal and increased  in fiscal the change in these accounts was primarily attributable to the recording of net pension costs and the timing and amount of pension contributions to our company sponsored plans 
in fiscal  our pension contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow 
in fiscal and  the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash inflow 
one of the factors increasing the amount of taxes paid in fiscal and fiscal  as compared to the amounts paid in fiscal  was the amount of deductible pension contributions made during the year 
our contributions to our defined benefit plans were   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we expect to contribute approximately  to our defined benefit plans in fiscal also impacting taxes paid is the net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  being incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral  due to increased volume through bscc

this facility replaced the previous  us dollar and  canadian dollar revolving credit agreements in the us and canada  respectively  both of which were terminated in november during fiscal  and  aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately  to   to  and  to  respectively 
outstanding commercial paper issuances were  as of june  and  as of august  in june  we repaid the senior notes totaling  at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in july  we repaid the senior notes totaling  at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in april  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering  in debt securities 
the registration statement was declared effective in may in september  we issued senior notes totaling  due on september   under the april shelf registration 
these notes  which were priced at of par  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption 
proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of september 
table of contents in march  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of  as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the fair value of the swap as of july  was  which is reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet  with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss  net of tax  in other comprehensive income loss 
in september  in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes described above  we settled the  notional amount forward starting interest rate swap 
upon termination  we paid cash of  which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination 
this amount is being amortized as interest expense over the year term of the debt  and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss  net of tax  in other comprehensive income loss

total debt as of june  was  of which approximately was at fixed rates averaging and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 
certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders  including provisions to maintain our long term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of june  as part of normal business activities  we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements

other considerations product liability claim in july   sysco was found contractually liable in arbitration proceedings related to a product liability claim from one of our former customers 
as of june   we have recorded  on our consolidated balance sheet within accrued expenses related to the accrual of this loss 
also as of june   a corresponding receivable of  is included in the consolidated balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets  which represents the estimate of the loss less the  deductible on sysco s insurance policy 
we have hold harmless agreements with the product suppliers and are named as an additional insured party under the suppliers policies with their insurers 
further  we maintain our own product liability insurance with coverage related to this claim 
we believe it is probable that we will be able to recover the recorded loss from one or more of these sources 
multi employer pension plans as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multi employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans  a plan s termination  our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any under funded multi employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi employer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
based on the information available from plan administrators  we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on all the multi employer plans we participate in  some of which appear to be under funded  could be as much as  for those plans that appear to be under funded  we do not currently believe that it is probable that there will be a mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or that any of the plans will terminate in the near future 
however  required contributions to multi employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  the pension protection act  enacted in august  will require under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under funding  perhaps beginning as soon as calendar unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may be required to cancel planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items 

table of contents bscc cooperative structure our affiliate  bscc  is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the unites states internal revenue code 
we believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of bscc are appropriate under the tax laws 
however  if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of bscc were to be successfully challenged by any federal  state or local tax authority  we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with bscc that we otherwise have deferred until future periods  and in that event  would be liable for interest on such amounts 
as of june   we have recorded deferred income tax liabilities of  related to the bscc supply chain distributions 
this amount represents the income tax liabilities related to bscc that were accrued  but the payment had been deferred as of june  in addition  if the irs or any other taxing authority determines that all amounts since the inception of bscc were inappropriately deferred or that bscc should have been a taxable entity  we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred  as discussed above  we may have liability  representing interest that would be payable on the cumulative deferred balances ranging from  to  prior to federal and state income tax benefit  as of june  we calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of bscc applying the applicable jurisdictions interest rates in effect in each period 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the irs  in connection with its audit of our and federal income tax returns  proposed adjustments related to the taxability of bscc 
we are vigorously protesting these adjustments 
we have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the irs and based upon our review  we believe that the resulting interest is not a probable liability and accordingly  have not recorded any related amount in any period 
a taxing authority requiring us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest  if any  could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may have to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations short term debt and commercial paper long term debt capital lease obligations product liability claim deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to debt long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations relates to a recent arbitration award against us for which we expect reimbursement 
see discussion under other considerations in liquidity and capital resources 
the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year 
table of contents period ending in fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june  included  in cash 
this amount is not included in the table above 
no obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of july   we do not have a minimum funding requirement under erisa guidelines for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions 
however  we intend to make voluntary contributions to the qualified retirement plan totaling  during fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  accounting for business combinations and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
in addition  allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including bankruptcy  accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years and prior 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year end to may st to assist us in meeting accelerated sec filing dates 
as a result of this change  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 
with the issuance of sfas see accounting changes for further discussion  we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time 
as a result  beginning in fiscal  the measurement date will return to correspond with our fiscal year end 
we have performed measurements as of may  and june  of our plan assets and benefit obligations 
we will record a charge to opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal of  net of tax  for the impact of the difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates 
we will also record a benefit to opening accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of fiscal of  net of tax  for the impact of the difference in 
table of contents our recognition provision between the two measurement dates 
the measurement date used to determine fiscal net pension costs for all plans was june  for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate assumptions utilized impact the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal increased to from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal of 
of the  decrease in net pension costs for fiscal  this increase in the discount rate decreased sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  primarily because the higher discount rate in fiscal generated less amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses in fiscal as compared to fiscal the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the qualified pension plan retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  decreased to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated  a increase in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease sysco s net pension cost by  while a decrease in the discount rates would increase pension expense by  the impact of a increase in the discount rates differ from the impact of a decrease in discount rates because a decrease in discount rates would require additional amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses which would not be required at our current discount rates or with a increase in these rates 
we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
we used a plan specific age related set of rates for the retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of as of june  and july  the serp assumes annual salary increases of through fiscal and thereafter as of june  and july  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately   and over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately prior to the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas  minimum pension liability adjustments resulted when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets and were recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
minimum pension liability adjustments were non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge or benefit to shareholders equity  net of tax  through accumulated other comprehensive loss or income 
the amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income related to minimum pension liability  was a charge  net of tax  of  as of july  the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas as of june  resulted in the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june  after adoption of sfas was a charge  net of tax  of  which represented the net unrecognized actuarial losses  unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of sfas as of that date 
changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plan  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  decreased net pension costs  in fiscal and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal by approximately  we made cash contributions to our pension plans of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  as in the previous years  contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but we anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of  which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other post retirement plans together are approximately  
table of contents income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  we establish an accrual when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable 
when facts and circumstances change  these accruals are adjusted 
beginning in fiscal  we will adopt fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which will change the accounting for tax positions 
see discussion under note  new accounting standards  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
in certain of these latter instances  the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco 
in these cases  we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 
accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our six operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units 
the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and the non employee directors stock plan 
prior to july   we accounted for our stock option plans and the employees stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants and issuances of stock pursuant to the employees stock purchase plan 
however  share based compensation expense was recognized in periods prior to fiscal and continues to be recognized for stock issuances pursuant to the management incentive plan and stock grants to non employee directors 
share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted through july   but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share 
table of contents based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r on july   sysco s earnings before income taxes and net earnings for fiscal were  and  lower  respectively  than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal were both lower than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb as of june   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans is based on the stock price less a discount for post vesting restrictions 
the discount for post vesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan is accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
in those cases  we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in other cases  certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate 
in these cases  if it is probable that the performance condition will be met  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period  otherwise  we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 
in addition  certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds  the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee 
in these cases  for awards granted prior to july   we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires 
for awards granted subsequent to july   we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 
sfas 
fin clarifies the application of sfas by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  along with accounting for the related interest and penalties 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and therefore became effective for sysco on july  while we continue to analyze the financial statement impact resulting from the adoption of fin  we estimate that the cumulative effect adjustment may result in an increase to tax liabilities of  to  with an offsetting charge to beginning retained earnings

forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  long term debt to capitalization target ratios  anticipated capital expenditures  expected benefits of strategic business initiatives including the timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain project and related redistribution centers  the potential outcome of ongoing tax audits and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a above and elsewhere 
in addition  sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
the ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
fiscal as of june   we had outstanding  of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through september  excluding commercial paper issuances  our long term debt obligations as of june  of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june  in the following table as of june   commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long term based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our us and canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis

to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within shareholders equity due to translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars to us dollars 
our canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in us dollars  which has the potential to create taxable income in canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date 
a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate would not materially increase the tax liability associated with these notes 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 
fuel price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers
