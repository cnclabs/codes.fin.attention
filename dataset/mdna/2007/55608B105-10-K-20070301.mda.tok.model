general the trust is a delaware statutory trust that was formed on april  the company is a delaware limited liability company that was also formed on april  the trust is the sole holder of of the llc interests of the company 
prior to december   the trust was a wholly owned subsidiary of our manager  a member of the macquarie group 
we own  operate and invest in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses that are providing basic  everyday services  such as parking  roads and water  through long life physical assets 
these infrastructure businesses generally operate in sectors with limited competition and high barriers to entry 
as a result  they have sustainable and growing long term cash flows 
we operate and finance our businesses in a manner that maximizes these cash flows 
the company is dependent upon cash distributions from its businesses to meet its corporate overhead and to pay management fee expenses and to pay dividends 
we receive distributions through our directly owned holding company mic inc for all of our businesses based in the united states 
during  we also received interest and principal on our subordinated loans to  and dividends from  our toll road business and dividends from macquarie communications infrastructure group  or mcg  and south east water  or sew  through directly owned holding companies that we formed to hold our interest in each business and investment 
we sold our toll road business in december and our interests in mcg and sew in august and october of  respectively 
distributions received from our businesses and investments net of taxes  are available first to meet management fees and corporate overhead expenses then to fund distribution payments by the company to the trust for payment to holders of trust stock 
base and performance management fees payable to our manager are allocated among the company and the directly owned subsidiaries based on the company s internal allocation policy 
on may   the company s board of directors declared a distribution of per share for the quarter ended march  which was paid on june  to holders of record on june  on august   the company s board of directors declared a distribution of per share for the quarter ended june  which was paid on september  to holders of record on september  on november   the company s board of directors declared a distribution of per share for the quarter ended september  which was paid on december  to holders of record on december  on february   the company s board of directors declared a dividend of per share payable on april  to holders of record on april  tax treatment of distributions each holder of trust stock will be required to include in us federal taxable income its allocable share of trust income  gain  loss deductions and other items 
the amounts shareholders include in taxable income may not equal the cash distributions to shareholders 
some of the distributions received by the trust on its investment in the company may be a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes 
therefore  the amount we distribute to our shareholders may exceed their allocable share of the items of income and expense 
the extent to which the distributions from the company will be characterized as dividend income cannot be estimated at this time 
in some cases  distributions to holders of trust stock may be less than the items of income 
if cash distributions exceed the allocable items of income and deductions  the shareholder s tax basis in its investment will generally be decreased by the excess  increasing the potential capital gain on the sale of the stock 
correspondingly  if the cash distributions are less than the allocable items of income and deductions  there will be an increase in the shareholders basis and reduction in the potential capital gain 
as a result of our dispositions during  we recorded accounting gains of approximately million 
capital gains approximating these amounts are allocated to shareholders who held shares of our stock on the last day of the month preceding the respective closing dates of each of the dispositions 
beyond  the portion of our distributions that will be treated as dividends  interest or return of capital for us federal income tax purposes is subject to a number of uncertainties 
we currently anticipate that substantially all of the portion of our regular distributions that are treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes should be characterized as qualified dividend income 
other tax matters a recent pronouncement by the irs questions the characterization of entities with structures like ours as grantor trusts and could change how we comply with our tax information reporting obligations 
depending on the resolution of these matters  we may be required to report allocable income  expense and credit items to the irs and to shareholders on schedule k  in addition to or instead of the letter we send to investors each year 
a change in the characterization of the trust would not change shareholders distributive share of items of income  gain  loss and expense of the trust or the company  nor would it change the income tax liability of the trust or the company 
if we are required  or reasonably likely to be required  to issue schedule k s to shareholders  we would exchange all shares of outstanding trust stock for an equal number of llc interests and  further  we intend to take all necessary steps to elect to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
in that case  we would have the same tax reporting obligations of a corporation rather than a partnership and would not be required to issue schedule k s to shareholders 
acquisitions and dispositions on december   we completed our ipo and concurrent private placement  issuing a total of  shares of trust stock at a price of per share 
total gross proceeds were million before offering costs and underwriting fees of million 
the majority of the proceeds were used to acquire our airports services business  airport parking business  district energy business  toll road business and investments in mcg and sew in december in and  we completed additional acquisitions in our existing business segments and in new segments and disposed of our toll road business and our investments in mcg and sew  as follows 
airport services business on july   our airport services business acquired of the shares of trajen holdings  inc  or trajen  the holding company for fixed base operations  or fbos  at airports in states 
in addition  on august   our airport services business acquired all of the membership interests in eagle aviation resources  or ear  operating an fbo in las vegas 
on january   our airport services business acquired general aviation holdings  llc  or gah  with two fbos in california 
with these acquisitions  our airport services business owned and operated  at year end  a network of fbos and one heliport in the united states  the second largest such network in the industry 
airport parking business in october  our airport parking business acquired real property  and personal and intangible assets related to six off airport parking facilities collectively referred to as sunpark as well as a leasehold facility in cleveland 
our airport parking business also acquired a facility in philadelphia in july following these acquisitions and consolidations  as discussed further below  our airport parking business has become the largest provider of off airport parking services in the united states with facilities at airports across the united states 
gas production and distribution business we acquired tgc on june  tgc owns and operates the sole regulated synthetic natural gas production and distribution business in hawaii and distributes and sells liquefied petroleum gas through unregulated operations 
bulk liquid storage terminal business on may   we completed the purchase of newly issued common stock of imtt holdings inc  the holding company for a group of companies and partnerships that operate imtt 
as a result of this transaction  we own of imtt holdings issued and outstanding common stock 
we have entered into a shareholders agreement which provides  with some exceptions  for minimum aggregate quarterly distributions of million to be paid by imtt holdings  or million to us  beginning with the quarter ended june  and through the quarter ending december  dispositions on august   we sold our  stapled securities of macquarie communications infrastructure group asx mcg for million 
on october   we sold our minority interest in the holding company for south east water to hdf uk holdings limited and received net proceeds on the sale of approximately million 
on december  we disposed of our toll road business through the sale of our interest in connect m a holdings limited chl  for net proceeds of approximately million 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information on recent acquisitions and the related financings 
see note  dispositions  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information on recent dispositions 
equity offering during the fourth quarter of  we completed an offering of an aggregate of  shares of trust stock at a price per share of for which we received net proceeds of million 
the net cash proceeds from the equity offering and the sales of our interests in mcg and sew were primarily used to repay in full indebtedness under the mic inc acquisition credit facility 
pending acquisitions on december   we entered into a business purchase agreement and a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire of the interests in entities that own and operate two fixed base operations  or fbos 
the total purchase price is a cash consideration of million subject to working capital adjustments 
in addition to the purchase price  it is anticipated that a further million will be incurred to cover transaction costs  integration costs and reserve funding 
the fbos are located at stewart international airport in new york and santa monica airport in california 
we expect to close the transaction through our airport services business 
we expect to finance the purchase price and the associated transaction and other costs  in part  with million of additional term loan borrowings under an expansion of the credit facility at our airport services business 
we expect to pay the remainder of the purchase price and associated costs with cash on hand 
the credit facility will continue to be secured by all of the assets and stock of companies within the airport services business 
impact of acquisitions on our results of operations results of the operations of each of the acquisitions in our airport services and airport parking businesses and the acquisition of tgc are included in our consolidated results from the respective date of acquisition 
these acquisitions resulted in significant increases in the recorded value of our property  plant and equipment  our intangible assets  including goodwill  our airport contract rights  customer relationships and technology  and in depreciation and amortization expense 
our and annual depreciation and amortization expense increased as this additional expense was fully reflected in our results 
these acquisitions also resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
our acquisition of of imtt holdings is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our financial statements from may  we have financed a significant portion of our acquisition purchase prices with debt incurred at the business segment level  other than our investment in imtt 
the increased levels of debt have resulted in significant increases in interest expense from the respective date of acquisition 
simultaneous with our acquisition of our parking business holding company  the holding company increased its economic ownership in the underlying macquarie parking business from to 
minority shareholders did not contribute their full pro rata share of capital raised for acquisitions in as a result  we increased our ownership in the business from to 
the historical results of the parking business discussed in this section include a larger allocation of net losses to the minority investors in and operating segments and businesses airport services business our airport services business depends upon the level of general aviation activity  and jet fuel consumption  for the largest portion of its revenue 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic and demographic growth in the regions serviced by a particular airport and the general rate of economic growth in the united states 
a number of our airports are located near key business centers  for example  new york teterboro  chicago midway and philadelphia 
we believe the traffic generated by the businesses at these locations could help our fbos at these locations grow at a faster rate than the industry average nationwide 
fuel revenue is a function of the volume sold at each location and the average per gallon sale price 
the average per gallon sale price is a function of our cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities for each gallon sold cost of revenue fuel  plus our margin 
our fuel gross profit fuel revenue less cost of revenue fuel depends on the volume of fuel sold and the average dollar based margin earned per gallon 
the dollar based margin charged to customers varies based on business considerations 
dollar based margins per gallon are relatively insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
our airport services business also earns revenue from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  our airport services business earns revenue from refueling some general aviation customers and some commercial airlines on a pass through basis  where we act as a fueling agent for fuel suppliers and for commercial airlines  receiving a fee  generally on a per gallon basis 
in addition  our airport services business earns revenue from aircraft landing and parking fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing and hangar rental 
at some facilities we also provide de icing services to commercial airlines 
our airport services business also earns management fees for its operation of six regional airports under management contracts 
in generating non fuel revenue  our airport services business incurs supply expenses cost of revenue non fuel  such as de icing fluid costs and payments to airport authorities  which vary from site to site 
cost of revenue non fuel is directly related to the volume of services provided and therefore generally increases in line with non fuel revenue in dollar terms 
our airport services business incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo  such as rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature 
other expenses incurred in operating each fbo  such as salaries  generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  our airport services business incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 
bulk liquid storage terminal business imtt provides bulk liquid storage and handling services in north america through a total of eight terminals located on the east  west and gulf coasts and the great lakes region of the united states and a partially owned terminal in each of quebec and newfoundland  canada  with the largest terminals located on the new york harbor and on the mississippi river near the gulf of mexico 
imtt stores and handles petroleum products  various chemicals and vegetable and animal oils 
imtt is one of the largest companies in the bulk liquid storage terminal industry in the united states  based on storage capacity 
the key drivers of imtt s revenue and gross profit are the amount of tank capacity rented to customers and the rates at which such capacity is rented 
customers generally rent tanks under contracts with terms of between one and five years 
under these contracts  customers generally pay for the capacity of the tank irrespective of whether the tank is actually used 
the key driver of storage capacity utilization and tank rental rates is the demand for capacity relative to the supply of capacity in a particular region eg  new york harbor  lower mississippi river 
demand for capacity is primarily a function of the level of consumption of the bulk liquid products stored by the terminals and the level of importation and exportation of such products 
demand for petroleum and liquid chemical products  the main products stored by imtt  historically has generally been driven by the level of economic activity 
we believe major increases in the supply of new bulk liquid storage capacity in imtt s key markets has been and will continue to be limited by the availability of waterfront land with access to the infrastructure necessary for land based receipt and distribution of stored product road  rail and pipelines  lengthy environmental permitting processes and high capital costs 
we believe a favorable supply demand balance for bulk liquid storage currently exists in the markets serviced by imtt s major facilities 
this factor  when combined with the attributes of imtt s facilities such as deep water drafts and access to land based infrastructure  have resulted in available storage capacity at imtt s major facilities for both petroleum and chemical products being consistently fully or near fully rented to customers 
imtt earns revenue at its terminals from a number of sources including storage of bulk liquids per barrel  per month rental  throughput of liquids handling charges  heating a pass through of the cost associated with heating liquids to prevent excessive viscosity and other revenue from blending  packaging and warehousing  for example 
the key elements of revenue generally increase annually on the basis of inflation escalation provisions in customer contracts 
in operating its terminals  imtt incurs labor costs  fuel costs  repair and maintenance costs  real and personal property taxes and other costs which include insurance and other operating costs such as utilities and inventory used in packaging and drumming activities 
in  imtt generated approximately of its total terminal revenue and of its terminal gross profit at its bayonne  nj facility  which services new york harbor  and of its total terminal revenue and of its terminal gross profit at its st 
rose  la  gretna  la and avondale  la facilities  which together service the lower mississippi river region with st 
rose being the largest contributor 
there are two key factors that are likely to materially impact imtt s total terminal revenue and terminal gross profit in the future 
first  imtt has achieved substantial increases in storage rates at its bayonne and st 
rose facilities and some customers of imtt have already agreed to extend contracts that do not expire until and at rates above the existing rates under such contracts 
based on the current level of demand for bulk liquid storage in new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  we anticipate that imtt will achieve annual increases in storage revenue in excess of inflation at least through second  imtt intends to undertake significant growth capital expenditure which is expected to contribute to terminal gross profit to a lesser extent in and a greater extent in and beyond as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as prescribed in the shareholders agreement between mic  imtt holdings and its other shareholders  until december   subject to compliance with law  the debt covenants applicable to its subsidiaries and retention of appropriate levels of reserves  imtt holdings is required to distribute million per quarter to us 
at december   we recorded a million receivable in connection with the expected receipt of our share of the cash distribution for the fourth quarter of which was received on january  subsequent to december   subject to the same limitations applicable prior to december  and subject to imtt holdings consolidated net debt to ebitda ratio not exceeding as at each quarter end  imtt holdings is required to distribute  quarterly  all of its consolidated cash flow from operations and cash flows from but not used in investing activities less maintenance and environmental remediation capital expenditure to its shareholders 
based on current market conditions and assuming that the construction of the new facility at geismar is completed in early and a number of the expansion opportunities currently being considered by imtt are pursued and completed during and  it is anticipated that imtt s total terminal revenue  terminal gross profit and cash flow provided by operating activities will increase significantly through  enabling the current level of annual distributions from imtt to mic to be maintained beyond our interest in imtt holdings  from the date of closing our acquisition  may   is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cash distributions received by us in excess of our equity in imtt s earnings and amortization charges are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows in net cash used in investing activities under return on investment in unconsolidated business 
gas production and distribution business tgc is a hawaii limited liability company that owns and operates the regulated synthetic natural gas production and distribution business in hawaii and distributes and sells liquefied petroleum gas through unregulated operations 
tgc operates in both regulated and unregulated markets on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
the hawaii market includes hawaii s approximate million resident population and approximate million annual visitors 
tgc has two primary businesses  utility or regulated and non utility or unregulated the utility business includes distribution and sales of sng on the island of oahu and distribution and sale of lpg to approximately  customers through localized distribution systems located on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai listed by size of market 
utility revenue consists principally of sales of thermal units  or therms  of sng and gallons of lpg 
one gallon of lpg is the equivalent of therms 
the operating costs for the utility business include the cost of locally purchased feedstock  the cost of manufacturing sng from the feedstock  lpg purchase costs and the cost of distributing sng and lpg to customers 
the non utility business comprises the sale of lpg to approximately  customers  through truck deliveries to individual tanks located on customer sites on oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
non utility revenue consists of sales of gallons of lpg 
the operating costs for the non utility business include the cost of purchased lpg and the cost of distributing the lpg to customers 
sng and lpg have a wide number of commercial and residential applications  including electricity generation  water heating  drying  cooking  and gas lighting 
lpg is also used as a fuel for some automobiles  specialty vehicles and forklifts 
gas customers range from residential customers for which tgc has nearly all of the market  to a wide variety of commercial customers 
revenue is primarily a function of the volume of sng and lpg consumed by customers and the price per thermal unit or gallon charged to customers 
because both sng and lpg are derived from petroleum  revenue levels  without volume changes  will generally track global oil prices 
utility revenue includes fuel adjustment charges through which the changes in fuel costs are passed through to utility customers 
as a result  the key measure of performance for this business is contribution margin 
volume is primarily driven by demographic and economic growth in the state of hawaii and by shifts of end users between gas and other energy sources and competitors 
the hawaii department of business  economic development  and tourism has forecast population growth for the state of per year through there are approximately regulated utilities operating in hawaii 
these comprise one gas utility  four electric utilities  water and sewage utilities and telecommunications utilities 
the four electric utility operators  combined  serve approximately  customers 
since all businesses and residences have electrical connections  this provides an estimate of the total gas market potential 
tgc s regulated customer base is approximately  and its non regulated customer base is approximately  accordingly  tgc s overall market penetration  as a percentage of total electric utility customers in hawaii  is approximately of hawaii businesses and residences 
tgc has of hawaii s regulated gas business and approximately of hawaii s unregulated gas business 
prices charged by tgc to its customers for the utility gas business are based on hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  regulated rates that allow tgc the opportunity to recover its costs of providing utility gas service  including operating expenses  taxes  a return of capital investments through recovery of depreciation and a return on the capital invested 
tgc s rate structure generally allows it to maintain a relatively consistent dollar based margin per thermal unit by passing increases or decreases in fuel costs to customers through the fuel adjustment charges without filing a general rate case 
tgc incurs expenses in operating and maintaining its facilities and distribution network  comprising a sng plant  a mile transmission line   miles of distribution pipelines  several tank storage facilities and a fleet of vehicles 
these costs are generally fixed in nature 
other operating expenses incurred  such as lpg  feedstock for the sng plant and revenue based taxes  are generally sensitive to the volume of product sold 
in addition  tgc incurs general and administrative expenses at its executive office that include expenses for senior management  accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance  regulatory compliance  employee benefits  rents  utilities  insurance and other normal business costs 
the rates that are charged to non utility customers are set based on lpg and delivery costs  and on the cost of fuel and competitive factors 
as part of the regulatory approval process of our acquisition of tgc  we agreed to regulatory conditions addressing a variety of matters 
the more significant conditions include the non recoverability of goodwill  transaction or transition costs in future rate cases  a limitation on tgc s ability to file for a new rate case with a prospective test year commencing prior to  a requirement to limit tgc and hgc s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital to  a requirement to maintain million in readily available cash resources at tgc  hgc or the company  a requirement that tgc revise its fuel adjustment clause to reconcile monthly charges to corresponding actually incurred fuel expenses  and a requirement that tgc provide a million customer appreciation credit from a vendor funded escrow account  to its gas customers 
district energy business our district energy business is comprised of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned by us 
thermal chicago sells chilled water to approximately customers in the chicago downtown area and one customer outside of the downtown area under long term contracts 
pursuant to these contracts  thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received irrespective of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 
consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are a per unit charge for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the second and third quarters of each year when the demand for chilled water is at its highest 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of economic indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual economic indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 
thermal chicago s principal direct expenses in were electricity  labor  operations and maintenance  depreciation and accretion and other 
electricity usage fluctuates in line with the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago particularly focuses on minimizing the amount of electricity consumed per unit of chilled water produced by operating its plants to maximize efficient use of electricity 
other direct expenses  including labor  operations and maintenance  depreciation  and general and administrative are largely fixed irrespective of the volumes of chilled water produced 
in  the illinois electricity generation market was deregulated as discussed under our businesses and investments district energy business business thermal chicago electricity costs in item business 
thermal has entered into a contract with a retail energy supplier to provide for the supply of the majority of our electricity at a fixed price and the remainder is a cost passed through to us from a customer 
we estimate our electricity costs will increase on a per unit basis by over we will need to enter into supply contracts for and subsequent years which may result in further increases in our electricity costs 
future rate cases or rehearing s with the icc may also increase our electricity costs 
about or million of our consumption revenue for thermal chicago was linked to the midwest producer price index 
the producer price index escalation was intended to reflect the increases in the cost of electricity over time but because it is based on costs across a broad geographic region in the midwest  it does not fully reflect changes in electricity costs that occur locally or from deregulation 
beginning january   and based on provisions of their contracts  the escalation for the electricity cost changes in consumption revenue will reflect actual increases or decreases in thermal chicago s electricity cost 
northwind aladdin provides cold and hot water and back up electricity under two long term contracts that expire in february pursuant to these contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments of approximately million per annum through march and monthly fixed payments of approximately million per year thereafter through february in addition  northwind aladdin receives consumption and other variable payments from its customers that allow it to recover substantially all of its operating costs 
approximately of total contract payments are received from the aladdin resort and casino and the balance from the desert passage shopping mall 
airport parking business the revenue of our airport parking business include both parking and non parking components 
parking revenue  which accounts for the substantial majority of total revenue is driven by the volume of passengers using the airports at which the business operates its market share at each location and its parking rates 
we aim to grow our parking revenue by increasing our market share at each location and optimizing parking rates taking into consideration local demand and competition 
our airport parking business seeks to increase market share through marketing initiatives to attract both returning customers and air travelers who have not previously used off airport parking and through improved services 
our ability to successfully execute marketing  pricing and service initiatives is key to maintaining and growing revenue 
non parking revenue includes primarily transportation services 
our parking business customers pay a fee for parking at its locations 
the parking fees collected constitute revenue earned 
the prices charged are a function of demand  quality of service and competition 
parking rate increases are often led by on airport parking lots and changes in the competitive environment 
most airports have historically increased parking rates rapidly with increases in demand  creating a favorable pricing environment for off airport competitors 
however  in certain markets  the airport may not raise rates in line with general economic trends 
further  our airport parking business seeks to increase parking rates through the value added services such as valet parking  car washes and covered parking 
turnover and intra day activity are captured in the cars out or total number of customers exiting during the period 
this measure  in combination with average parking revenue per car out and average overnight occupancy  are primary indicators of our customer mix and reflect our ongoing revenue management efforts 
average parking revenue is a function of the fee for parking  the discount applied  if any  and the number of days the customer is parked at the facility 
for example  an increase in average parking revenue over time can be a result of increased pricing  reduced discounting or an increase in the average length of stay 
in the discussion of our airport parking business results of operations  we disclose the average overnight occupancy for each period 
our airport parking business measures occupancy by counting the number of cars at the lowest point of the day between am and am every night 
at this time  customer activity is low  and thus an accurate measure of the car count may be taken at each location 
this method means that turnover and intra day activity are not taken into account and therefore occupancy during the day is likely to be much higher than when the counts are undertaken 
in providing parking services  our airport parking business incurs expenses  such as personnel costs  real estate related costs and the costs of leasing  operating and maintaining its shuttle buses 
these costs are incurred in providing customers with service at each parking lot as well as in transporting them to and from the airport terminal 
generally  as the level of occupancy  or usage  at each of the business locations increases  labor and the other costs related to the operation of each facility increase 
we also incur costs related to damaged cars either as a result of the actions of our employees or criminal activity 
the business is continually reviewing security and safety measures to minimize these costs 
other costs incurred by macquarie parking relate to the provision of the head office function that the business requires to operate 
these costs include marketing and advertising  rents and other general and administrative expenses associated with the head office function 
results of operations we acquired our initial businesses and investments on december and december  using the majority of the proceeds of our initial public offering 
as a consequence  our consolidated operating results for the year ended december  only reflect the results of operations of our businesses and investments for a nine day period between december  and december  any comparisons between our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in to would not be meaningful 
we have therefore included a comparison of the historical results of operations and cash flows for these periods each of our consolidated businesses that we owned at the end of  which we believe is a more appropriate approach to explaining the historical financial performance of the company 
we have also provided a comparison of the historical results of operations and cashflows of tgc and imtt from periods prior to our ownership to provide a better understanding of the performance of these businesses 
key factors affecting operating results positive contributions from our acquisitions including acquisition of the trajen network of fbo s and the acquisition of a las vegas fbo eagle aviation resources  or ear by our airport services business  the acquisition of of imtt  the earnings of which are reflected in equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee  the tgc acquisition  and eight new locations in our airport parking business 
increased consolidated gross profit driven by improved performance at our airport services and airport parking businesses  dividend and interest income from investments totaling million in higher management fees  including the million performance fee earned by the manager in the first quarter  which it has reinvested in shares of trust stock  and higher base management fees due to our increased market capitalization  an increase in interest expense due to the overall increase in our debt to partially fund our acquisitions  gains on the sale of our non us investments of million  and non cash impairment charge on intangible assets at our airport parking business totaling million related to a re branding initiative 
during  we received million in distributions from imtt holdings  which reduced our investments in unconsolidated businesses on our balance sheet but was not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
we received a further million from imtt holdings in january during and  we also received dividends from our toll road business amounting to million and million  respectively  which were not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our consolidated results of operations are summarized below in thousands year ended december  year ended december  change april  inception to december  revenue revenue from product sales service revenue financing and equipment lease income total revenue cost of revenue cost of product sales cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative fees to manager depreciation amortization of intangibles operating income loss other income expense dividend income interest income interest expense equity in earnings loss and amortization charges of investees nm unrealized losses on derivative instruments nm gain on sale of equity investment nm gain on sale of investment nm gain on sale of marketable securities nm other income  net nm net income loss before income taxes and minority interests income tax benefit nm net income loss before minority interests nm minority interests net income nm nm not meaningful includes a non cash impairment charge of million for existing trademarks and domain names due to a re branding initiative 
gross profit the increase in our consolidated gross profit was due primarily to the acquisitions of trajen on july   tgc on june   a las vegas fbo in the third quarter of and six off airport parking facilities collectively referred to as sunpark during the second half of additionally  higher average dollar based margin per gallon combined with stable fuel volumes at existing locations in our airport services business and higher average revenue per car out in our airport parking business contributed to increases in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses the most significant factors in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were million additional costs from the addition of tgc and trajen not reflected in results  additional costs at our parking businesses s corporate office primarily to support a larger organization resulting from growth in number of locations and reorganization of the finance structure  and additional compensation expense related to stock appreciation rights issued during additionally  the management fee paid to our manager increased due to million in performance fees in which were reinvested in stock  compared to none in  as well as a million increase in the base fee due primarily to our increased asset base 
other income expense our dividend income in consists of dividends declared by and received from sew in the first and third quarters and a dividend declared by mcg in the second quarter and received in the third quarter 
the comparable sew dividends from  were both declared and received in the second quarter and fourth quarter 
interest income increased primarily as a result of higher interest rates on invested cash in interest expense increased due mostly to a higher average level of debt in our equity in the earnings on our owned investments increased  primarily due to the addition of imtt in and a gain from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that yorkshire records in the income statement  compared with a loss recorded in the second quarter of income taxes the income tax benefit in results primarily from a deferred tax benefit recorded on the write down of intangible assets at our parking business 
the pre tax gain in is due largely to gains on the sales of investments that are not taxable 
for the period from april  to december   we incurred a consolidated net loss of million as we had only nine days of operating results from our businesses and because of the million performance fee earned by our manager from the closing of our initial public offering until december  we incurred million of expenses related to the acquisitions of our businesses and organizational expenses 
we also earned million in dividend income from our investment in mcg  which was subsequently received in february for the year ended december   we earned consolidated net income of million 
our consolidated results included net income of million from our airport services business   from our district energy business  and a loss of million from our airport parking business 
our share of net income from the toll road business was million  net of non cash amortization expense of million and we also recognized  in other income 
we earned million including  of other income in dividend income from our investment in sew and million in dividend income from our investment in mcg 
we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million at the corporate level 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are million related to complying with the requirements under sarbanes oxley and million related to an unsuccessful acquisition bid

airport services business atlantic aviation and avports have been integrated and combined into a single reportable segment labeled existing locations 
results for have been restated to reflect the new combined segment 
in august and july  the company acquired a fbo in las vegas ear and a portfolio of fbos from trajen holdings 
results from these entities are labeled acquisitions 
the following section summarizes the historical consolidated financial performance of our airport services business for the year ended december  the acquisition column in the table below includes the operating results of trajen from the acquisition date of july  the acquisition column also includes the results of ear from january  through august  the results of ear from august through december for both and are included in the existing locations columns 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results contribution of positive operating results from ear since our acquisition in august  contribution of positive operating results from trajen fbos acquired in july  higher dollar per gallon fuel margins and higher volumes at existing locations  increased fuel prices resulting in higher fuel sales revenue and costs of goods sold  higher selling  general and administrative costs at existing locations primarily relating to increased non cash compensation expense  office rent and utility costs and increased credit card fees resulting from higher revenue  costs incurred for the re branding and integration of the trajen locations  and higher interest costs from higher debt levels resulting from the refinancing in december and the increased borrowings related to the trajen acquisition

revenue and gross profit most of the revenue and gross profit in our airport services business is generated through fueling general aviation aircraft at our fbos 
this revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel that we use to service these aircraft 
if we own the fuel  we record our cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
our corresponding fuel revenue is our cost to purchase that fuel plus a margin 
we generally pursue a strategy of maintaining and  where appropriate  increasing  dollar margins  thereby passing any increase in fuel prices to the customer 
we also have into plane arrangements whereby we fuel aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
we collect a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
other non fuel revenue includes various services such as hangar rentals  de icing and airport services 
cost of revenue non fuel includes our cost  if any  to provide these services 
the key factors for our revenue and gross profit are fuel volume and dollar margin per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
customers will occasionally change categories 
therefore  we believe discussing our fuel and non fuel revenue and gross profit and the related key metrics on a combined basis provides the most meaningful analysis of our airport services business 
our total revenue and gross profit growth was due to several factors inclusion of the results of ear for the full year of  inclusion of the results of trajen from july   rising cost of fuel at existing locations  which we generally pass on to customers  and an increase in fuel volumes and higher average dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  resulting largely from a higher proportion of transient customers  which generally pay higher margins  partially offset by lower de icing activity in the first quarter of due to milder weather in the northeast us our operations at new orleans  la and gulfport  ms were impacted by hurricane katrina 
some of our hangar and terminal facilities were damaged 
however  our results were not significantly affected by other storms 
we believe that we have an appropriate level of insurance coverage to repair or rebuild our facilities and protect us from business interruption losses that we may experience due to future hurricanes or similar events 
operating expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to increased non cash compensation expense largely due to the issuance of stock appreciation rights in the first quarter of  additional credit card fees related to increased fuel revenue  and additional office costs resulting from higher rent and utility costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the addition of the las vegas fbo and trajen 
interest expense  net excluding a million impact of deferred financing costs that were charged to expense in connection with a december refinancing  interest expense increased in due to the increased debt level associated with the debt refinancing and the acquisition of trajen and higher non cash amortization of deferred financing costs 
in december  we refinanced two existing debt facilities with a single debt facility  increasing outstanding borrowings by million 
in july  we increased borrowings under this facility again by million to finance our acquisition of trajen 
the debt facility provides an aggregate term loan borrowing of million and includes a million working capital facility 
ebitda the increase in ebitda from existing locations  excluding the non cash lossfrom derivative instruments  is due to increased fuel volumes and higher average dollar per gallon fuel margins  lower other expense due to transaction costs incurred in relating to our acquisition of two fbos in california  partially offset by lower de icing revenue in  and higher selling  general and administrative costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following section summarizes the historical consolidated financial performance of our airport services business for the year ended december  information relating to existing locations in represents the results of our airport services business excluding the results of ear  an fbo in las vegas and gah  which comprises two california fbos 
the acquisition column below includes the operating results of ear and gah from the acquisition dates of august  and january   respectively 
the financial performance for the year ended december   was obtained by combining the following results executive air support  inc  or eas  from january  through july   on which date eas was acquired by our airport services business  our airport services business from january  through december   prior to our ownership and when it was operated as two separate businesses under separate ownership  and our airport services business during the period of our ownership from december  to december  key factors affecting operating results contribution of positive operating results from new locations in california and las vegas  higher average dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  continued increases in fuel prices resulting in higher fuel sales revenue and cost of sales  higher rental income from new hangars and increased tenant occupancy  no significant effect on results from hurricanes  and higher first quarter de icing revenue at our northeast locations

operating expenses the decrease in operating expenses at existing locations is due to non recurring transaction costs incurred by eas associated with the sale of the company in july this decrease was partially offset by increased professional fees and the implementation of a stock appreciation rights plan for certain employees at a part of our airport services business 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the recording of the business s net assets to fair value upon their acquisitions  partially offset by the expiration in november of a two year non compete agreement 
other expense the decrease in other expense in is primarily due to the recognition of expense attributable to outstanding warrants valued at approximately million that were subsequently cancelled in connection with the acquisition of atlantic aviation by the macquarie group in july  prior to our acquisition 
also included in results are  of costs associated with debt financing required to partially fund the macquarie group s acquisition of atlantic aviation and million of bridge costs associated with our acquisition of atlantic aviation 
in  atlantic aviations incurred underwriting fees of  in relation to the acquisition of gah that were funded with proceeds from our ipo 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in over largely as a result of an increase in the level of debt  which was incurred at the time of our acquisition of gah  and as a result of the refinancing described below 
interest expense in includes the following items million of amortization of deferred financing costs  including million of deferred financing costs relating to the previously refinanced debt that was written off at the time of the refinancing  and  of interest expense on subordinated debt  which we owned  that was converted to equity in june ebitda the substantial increase in ebitda from existing locations  excluding the unrealized gain on derivative instruments  is due to increased dollar fuel margins combined with a reduction in other expenses associated with the sale and financing of the acquisition of atlantic aviation by the macquarie group of approximately million in july excluding these expenses ebitda at existing locations would have increased 
bulk liquid storage terminal business we completed our acquisition of a interest in imtt on may  therefore  imtt only contributed to our consolidated results from this date 
we included million of net income in our consolidated results for the period may  through december   consisting of million equity in the earnings of imtt less million depreciation and amortization expense net of million tax effect amortization and a million tax benefit 
we received million in dividends from imtt during imtt declared a dividend of million in december with million payable to mic inc that we have recorded as a receivable at december  the dividend was received on january  to enable meaningful analysis of imtt s performance across periods  imtt s performance for the years ended december  is discussed below 
key factors affecting operating results terminal revenue and terminal gross profit increased in principally due to increases in average tank rental rates  and hurricane katrina caused increased spill clean up activity and higher environmental spill clean up revenue in that did not recur in year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands unaudited revenue terminal revenue terminal revenue heating environmental response revenue nursery revenue total revenue costs terminal operating costs terminal operating costs fuel environmental response operating costs nursery operating costs total costs terminal gross profit environmental response gross profit nursery gross profit nm gross profit operating expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income nm not meaningful year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue and gross profit terminal revenue increased primarily due to an increase in storage revenue caused by a increase in aggregate rented storage capacity and a increase in average storage rates in overall rented storage capacity increased slightly from to of available storage capacity in the increase in storage revenue was offset by reduced packaging revenue due to the closure of packaging operations at bayonne in the first quarter of in  imtt also achieved a million improvement in the differential between terminal revenue heating and terminal operating costs fuel due to a one time refund of million for fuel metering discrepancies received in the fourth quarter of and implementation of cost saving measures 
the increase in terminal revenue was partially offset by an increase in terminal operating costs other than terminal generating costs fuel 
this increase was principally due to increases in direct labor  health benefit and repair and maintenance costs offset partially by a non cash natural resource damage settlement accrual of million in the second quarter of that did not recur in environmental response gross profit decreased in due to a large contribution in from spill clean up activities resulting from hurricane katrina 
the nursery gross profit decreased due to a reduction in demand for plants in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and higher delivery costs due to increases in fuel costs 
operating expenses general and administrative expenses decreased slightly reflecting  of costs incurred by imtt during when it temporarily relocated its head office from new orleans to bayonne in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina  which did not recur in depreciation and amortization expense increased due to increased growth capital expenditure 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue and gross profit terminal revenue increased primarily due to an increase in storage revenue caused by a increase in aggregate rented storage capacity and a increase in average storage rates in overall rented storage capacity increased slightly from to of available storage capacity in in imtt also achieved a million improvement in the differential between terminal revenue heating and terminal operating costs fuel due to improved customer contract terms and efficiency gains in the use of fuel 
the increase in terminal revenue was partially offset by an increase in terminal operating costs other than terminal operating costs fuel 
of this increase  million related to the cost of a natural resource damages settlement reached with the state of new jersey which is not expected to recur 
the balance of the increase was due to general increases in direct labor and health benefit costs  property taxes  power costs and environmental compliance costs 
environmental response gross profit increased principally due to spill clean up activities resulting from hurricane katrina 
operating expenses general and administrative expenses increased partially as a result of  of costs incurred by imtt when it temporarily relocated its head office from new orleans to bayonne in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina 
other than a  insurance deductible expensed during  imtt incurred no other material costs related to hurricane katrina 
gas production and distribution business we completed our acquisition of tgc on june  therefore  tgc only contributed to our consolidated operating results from that date 
we included million of revenue and million of contribution margin for the period from june  through december  because tgc s results of operations are only included in our consolidated financial results for less than seven months of  the following analysis compares the historical results of operations for tgc under its current and prior owner 
we believe that this is the most appropriate approach to analyzing the historical financial performance and trends of tgc 
key factors affecting operating results utility revenue was reduced by million for two billing adjustments required by hawaii regulators as a condition to our acquisition  million of which is non recurring 
this resulted in an decrease in utility contribution margin 
we received cash reimbursement for the full amount through two escrow accounts that were established as purchase price adjustments when we acquired tgc  utility therm sales slightly increased due primarily to increased usage by a single interruptible customer  non utility contribution margin increased primarily due to price increases partially offset by a customer s closing of a propane cogeneration unit and lower overall sales volumes  operating and overhead costs increased due to an increase in personnel and associated benefit costs  increased repair costs for distribution systems and transmission line inspections and higher utility costs  and non cash unrealized losses on derivatives that resulted from changes in value of these instruments 
management analyzes contribution margin for tgc because it believes that contribution margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to understanding the performance of tgc utility operations under its regulated rate structure and of its non utility operations under a competitive pricing structure  both of which include an ability to change rates when the underlying fuel costs change 
contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income  or net income  which are determined in accordance with us gaap 
other companies may calculate contribution margin differently and  therefore  the contribution margin presented for tgc is not necessarily comparable with other companies

contribution margin and operating income tgc s total contribution margin declined and operating income declined by primarily due to a million customer rebate 
this rebate was required by hawaii state regulators as a condition of our purchase of tgc 
although utility revenue and contribution margin were reduced by this rebate  the cash effect was offset by reimbursement of the full amount from a restricted cash fund established under our tgc purchase agreement 
in addition  hawaii state regulators required tgc to modify its calculation of cost of fuel increases that are passed through to utility customers 
for the year ended december   this provision reduced the utility revenue and contribution margin by approximately million 
this cash effect was offset by withdrawals from our million escrow account established and funded at acquisition by the seller 
tgc can draw upon the escrow account to be reimbursed for these reductions 
these escrowed funds are available until the date that is one month subsequent to when new rates are made effective at tgc s next rate case 
tgc believes that these escrowed funds will be fully drawn upon within the next three years  thereafter escrowed funds would not be available 
the cash reimbursements of the customer rebate and any fuel cost adjustment amounts are not reflected in revenue but rather are reflected as releases of restricted cash and other assets 
excluding the effects of both the customer rebate and fuel cost calculation change  operating income would have increased by therms sold in the non utility sector decreased for the year principally due to the customer s closing of a propane powered cogeneration unit at its resort  as well as customer renovations and energy conservation measures 
lower therms sold were more than offset by an increase in non utility contribution margin primarily reflecting rate increases implemented since late production and transmission and distribution costs were higher than in due primarily to increased personnel and associated benefits costs  increased pipeline and plant repair costs  additional costs related to a us department of transportation mandated transmission pipeline inspection program and higher utility costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were comparable between and the absence of the prior owner s overhead allocations since our acquisition was partially offset by increased personnel and associated employee benefit costs  purchase transaction costs  and increased consulting costs 
depreciation and amortization was higher for the year due to equipment additions and the higher asset basis following our purchase of tgc in june interest expense interest expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in total debt resulting from our acquisition funding and prepayment fees of approximately million expensed by tgc s previous owner following early retirement of certain debt 
other expense income other expense for included million of costs incurred by the prior owners for their sale of tgc to us 
other income for included a million payment from an electric utility company to reimburse tgc under a cost sharing arrangement  for entry into an energy corridor fuel pipeline right of way 
both amounts are non recurring 
unrealized loss on derivatives during  tgc recognized a non cash expense of million as a result of a decrease in the carrying value of the derivative instruments 
these derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges as of january   and we expect most of the future changes in fair value to be reflected in other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet 
ebitda the decline in ebitda is due in large part to the customer rebate and the change in fuel adjustment calculations that were discussed above for which we have been reimbursed  as well as non cash unrealized losses on derivatives reflecting the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swaps 
excluding these amounts and the non recurring items noted under the selling  general and administrative and other expense income  ebitda would have been higher compared to district energy business year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results lower average temperatures during peak cooling season may to september resulted in lower ton hour sales  partially offset by contracted rate increases  capacity revenue increased due to four interruptible customers converting to continuous service over june through september and due to general increases in line with inflation  and higher electricity costs related to signing new energy supply contracts at three of our plants

gross profit gross profit for decreased slightly primarily due to lower ton hour sales from cooler weather and higher electric costs related to required changes to market based energy supply contracts at three of our plants  which commenced in may these increased costs were partially offset by the conversion of several interruptible customers to firm  annual inflation related increases of contract capacity rates and scheduled increases in contract consumption rates in accordance with the terms of existing customer contracts 
additionally  electric cost increases were mitigated by efficient operation of the downtown system s chilled water plants 
other revenue increased due to our pass through to customers of the higher cost of natural gas consumables  which are included in other direct expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher legal and third party consulting fees related to strategy work in preparation for the deregulation of illinois electricity market offset by the effects of adopting a new long term incentive plan for management employees in the first quarter of that required a net reduction in the liability previously accrued under the former plan 
interest expense  net the increase in net interest expense was due to additional credit line draws necessary to fund scheduled capital expenditures and new customer connections during the year 
our interest rate on our senior debt is a fixed rate 
other income expense the decrease in other income was due to a gain recognized in the second quarter of related to a minority investor s share of a settlement providing for the early release of escrow established with the aladdin bankruptcy and a loss on disposal of assets recognized in the fourth quarter of related to a customer termination due to bankruptcy 
ebitda ebitda decreased primarily due to the lower ton hour sales from cooler weather and higher electric costs related to signing new energy supply contracts at three of our plants 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the table below key factors affecting operating results compares the historical consolidated financial performance of the district energy business for the year ended december  to the year ended december  this table combines the following results of operations the predecessor thermal chicago corporation from january  through june   prior to its acquisition by the macquarie group  the district energy business from january  through december   when it was part of the macquarie group  the district energy business from december  through december   the period of our ownership  and ett nevada  the holding company for our interest in northwind aladdin  from september  through december   when it was part of the macquarie group 
at the time at which the business acquired a interest in northwind aladdin  it also acquired all of the senior debt of northwind aladdin 
as a consequence  interest expense included in the statement of operations below from september  through december  on such senior debt was eliminated in our consolidated financial statements for and all subsequent periods 
key factors affecting operating results full year of results for ett nevada in  capacity revenue generally increased in line with inflation  consumption ton hours sold were higher primarily due to above average temperature in chicago from june to september  and ebitda was higher due to the incremental margin from additional consumption ton hours sold and the inclusion of ett nevada

certain amounts shown above have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
additionally  a tax adjustment relating to that was recorded subsequent to our filing of form k last year has been reflected in the amounts shown above 
gross profit gross profit decreased at thermal chicago primarily due to increased acquisition related depreciation expense of million 
the higher non cash expense offset the increase in consumption ton hours sold resulting from above average temperatures in chicago from june to september annual inflation related increases of contract capacity rates and scheduled increases in contract consumption rates in accordance with the terms of existing customer contracts accounted for the remaining increase in revenue 
electricity expenses increased in line with consumption revenue 
operating efficiencies mitigated some of the impact of higher electricity costs 
higher direct labor costs from scheduled increases in wages and benefits for union workers and scheduled increases in maintenance contracts also contributed to the decrease in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses at thermal chicago decreased from primarily due to the absence of expenses and local taxes related to the sale of thermal chicago by exelon in of approximately million 
interest expense  net the substantial decrease in net interest expense was due to a make whole payment of million to redeem outstanding bonds prior to the acquisition of thermal chicago by the macquarie group on june  and other payments related to financing the acquisition 
the other payments included million related to the termination of an interest rate swap used to hedge long term interest rate risk pending issuance of notes in the private placement  and million related to a bridge loan financing 
as of december   the business had million in long term debt  consisting of million and million at fixed annual rates of and  respectively  and  drawn on its credit facility at fixed interest of libor plus 
ebitda ebitda excluding ett nevada decreased  due to a million financial restructuring gain in but for the gain  ebitda would have been  or higher  primarily due to the incremental consumption revenue from additional ton hours sold 
airport parking business in the following discussion  new locations refer to locations in operation during  but not in operation throughout the comparable period in comparable locations refer to locations in operation throughout the respective twelve month periods in both and we added nine new locations in the sunpark facilities located in houston  oklahoma city  st

parking revenue include all receipts from parking related revenue streams  which includes monthly  membership  and third party distribution companies 
cars out refers to the total number of customers existing during the period 
average overnight occupancy refers to aggregate average daily occupancy measured for all locations at the lowest point of the day and does not reflect turnover and intra day activity 
revenue revenue increased due to the addition of nine new locations during and an increase in average revenue per car out at comparable locations 
in  new locations represent of our portfolio by number of locations and contributed of total revenue 
we believe the contribution from these facilities will continue to grow as customers continue to be exposed to our branding  marketing and service 
average revenue per car out increased at our comparable locations primarily due to implementation of our yield management strategy  including price increases and reduced discounting in selected markets and a new marketing program 
a focus on improving the level of customer service in certain locations has supported these price increases 
the decrease in cars out at comparable locations was attributed to a continued strategic shift away from daily parkers and a greater marketing emphasis on leisure travelers throughout daily parkers  typically airport employees  contribute to a higher number of cars out  but pay discounted rates 
leisure travelers tend to have longer average stays 
the lower average revenue per car out at new locations  relative to comparable locations  in reflects the acquisition of new locations in lower priced markets 
average overnight occupancies at comparable locations were up slightly as capacity expansions in select markets were fully utilized 
we believe average length of stay came under pressure during the second half of as some leisure travelers chose shorter vacations due to higher costs for air fares  hotel and rental cars 
our airport parking business as a whole has sufficient capacity to accommodate further growth 
at locations where we are operating at peak capacity intra day  we continue to evaluate and implement strategies to expand capacity of these locations 
for example  during we recovered additional capacity from a sub tenant  installed additional vehicle lifts and  during peak periods  offered customers valet service at self park facilities 
operating expenses direct expenses for increased primarily due to additional costs associated with operating nine new locations 
direct expenses at comparable locations were also affected by higher real estate  fuel and labor costs offset by lower claims from damaged cars  advertising and insurance premiums 
we intend to continue pursuing costs savings through standardization of staff scheduling to minimize overtime and a new bulk fuel purchase program that was implemented in august direct expenses include rent in excess of lease  a non cash item  in the amount of million and million for and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher payroll costs associated with the expansion of the management team to support additional locations  health insurance and professional fees 
non recurring costs in include the retirement of two members of senior management from the business  costs associated with a restructure of the finance function and higher legal expenses associated with scheduled union negotiations 
amortization of intangibles amortization increased largely as a result of impairment charges in the amount of million related to the trademarks and domain names previously acquired  partially offset by the elimination of amortization of non compete agreements that expired in december as a result of our re branding initiative  we wrote down almost all of the value of our acquired trademarks and  as a result  amortization expense will decline significantly beginning in interest expense  net interest expense increased due to the additional interest and finance cost amortization associated with the new debt issued in october to finance acquisitions 
on september  this debt and our other primary borrowing were refinanced with more favorable terms and  of finance costs related to the october financing were expensed 
interest expense also increased as a result of higher libor rates 
our two primary borrowings were subject to two interest rate hedges which effectively capped our interest rate when the day libor rate was 
in march the libor rate exceeded the cap rate 
as part of the refinance on september  one of these interest rate hedges was replaced with an interest rate swap at 
interest cap and swap payments totaling  were realized in this amount was recorded as a reduction in interest expense 
ebitda ebitda increased largely as a result of the acquisitions and improved profit margins at our comparable locations 
ebitda was also increased by the proceeds from a settlement related to a acquisition 
net proceeds from the settlement totaled  and were recorded in other income 
the increase in gross profit margins at our new locations in reflects the acquisition of locations predominantly on owned land compared to the leased locations at avistar philadelphia and avistar st 
louis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results an increase in cars out at comparable locations and the revenue contributed by the new locations resulted in a increase in revenue during  reduced discounting and yield management of  for example  daily airport employee customers contributed to the slight increase in average parking revenue per car out for comparable locations

the increase in cars out was primarily due to the new locations with cars out at comparable locations increasing by 
the increase in average parking revenue per car out was due to reduced levels of discounting  and price increases at certain locations  including those with daily airport employee customers 
parking revenue at comparable locations grew at a higher rate than total revenue 
this is due to the exclusion of contract revenue from parking revenue and  the impact of the cash settlement from an early contract termination received in total revenue growth of million included million from the six sunpark facilities acquired in the fourth quarter 
certain discounting and pricing strategies that had resulted in lower parking revenue per car out during the first half of the year were adjusted during the second half of these lower levels of discounting and higher prices in certain markets resulted in improved revenue per car out during the second half of and resulted in revenue per car out being slightly higher 
the business has experienced increased competition in several locations which may put short term pressure on pricing 
in  promotional and service efforts will be focused on these markets to address this increased competition 
operating expenses direct expenses for increased million mainly by the additional costs associated with operating new locations 
direct expenses include non cash rent in excess of lease in the amount of million and  for the years and  respectively 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we recognize the total rent expense to be paid over the life of a lease on a straight line basis 
this generally results in rent expense higher than actual cash paid early in the lease and rent expense lower than actual cash paid later in the lease 
other factors affecting direct expenses at comparable locations are higher shuttle operating costs in the second half of due to the increased cost of fuel  higher rents related to new long term lease agreements that were secured in the fourth quarter and rental payments resulting from use of overflow lots in locations with capacity constraints  higher damaged car claims and  in response  higher security costs  higher advertising expenses reflecting a radio campaign during the fourth quarter  and lower selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from lower severance costs and performance bonuses  offset in part by higher professional fees and strategic planning initiatives 
on february   the board of mapc approved the implementation and issuance of a stock appreciation rights program  or sars  to reward certain key employees of the airport parking business and to incentivize those employees to increase the long term value of that business 
the sars will vest over a five year period  with the majority of the vesting to occur by july the sars will be valued based upon the estimated fair market value of the airport services business as calculated by us 
the estimated value of the sars is  based on the december  valuation  assuming vesting at that date 
amortization of intangibles amortization increased largely as a result of the increase in the fair value of the assets acquired when mapc was purchased by us on december  and the fair value of assets acquired in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by the accelerated amortization of customer contracts that expired in interest expense interest expense increased due to higher libor rates  partially offset by the elimination of deferred finance cost amortization resulting from our initial acquisition  and increases in our overall level of debt as a result of the acquisition the sunpark facilities and a facility in philadelphia 
we have an interest rate cap agreement at a base rate of libor equal to for a notional amount of million for the term of the loan and a second interest rate cap agreement at a base rate of libor equal to for a notional amount of million 
both interest rate caps were reached in the first quarter of ebitda excluding the aforementioned non cash deferred rent  the contract settlement in and unrealized losses on derivative instruments  ebitda would have increased by in new locations generated a gross profit margin of in compared to for the nine months ended september  this reflects the positive impact of the sunpark acquisition in the fourth quarter 
liquidity and capital resources we do not intend to retain significant cash balances in excess of what are prudent reserves 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our future liquidity requirements  including in relation to our acquisition strategy and our dividend policy 
we base our assessment on the following assumptions all of our businesses and investments generate  and are expected to continue to generate  significant operating cash flow  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses are modest and readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or borrowing facilities  all significant short term growth capital expenditure will be funded with cash on hand or from committed undrawn debt facilities  imtt will be able to refinance and increase the size of its existing debt facilities on amended terms during  that payments on thermal chicago northwind aladdin s debt that will begin to amortize in from operating cash flow  mic inc maintains a million acquisition credit facility maturing in with which to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  including million available for general corporate purposes  and we will be able to raise equity to refinance any amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
the section below discusses the sources and uses of cash of our businesses and investments 
our consolidated cash flow the following information details our consolidated cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities for the periods ended december   and we acquired our initial businesses and investments on december and december  using proceeds from our initial public offering and concurrent private placement 
consequently  our consolidated cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities in largely reflects the nine day period between december  and december  any comparisons of our consolidated cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for this short period in to any future periods would not be meaningful 
therefore we have included a comparison of the cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities for each of our consolidated businesses for each of the full years  and we believe this is a more appropriate approach to explaining our historical financial performance 
as of december   our consolidated cash and cash equivalent balances totaled million 
year ended december  year ended december  april  inception december  in thousands cash provided by used in operations cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities on a consolidated basis  cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  cash flow from operations increased over the increase is primarily the result of the positive contribution from acquisitions made by our airport services business and continued organic growth in our consolidated businesses and acquisition of tgc 
offsetting these increases were higher interest expenses resulting from increased debt levels 
on a consolidated basis  cash flow used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  reflecting our acquisitions during the year offset by the sales of our investments as well as cash distributions from imtt in excess of our equity in its earnings and amortization charges

we have detailed our capital expenditure on a segment by segment basis  which we believe is the most appropriate approach to explaining our capital expenditure requirements on a consolidated basis 
airport services business maintenance capital expenditure we expect to spend approximately million  or  per fbo  per year on maintenance capital expenditure at atlantic aviation s existing fbo s 
at our newly acquired trajen fbo s we expect to spend approximately million or  per fbo  per year on maintenance capital expenditure 
the amounts will be spent on items such as repainting  replacing equipment as necessary and any ongoing environmental or required regulatory expenditure  such as installing safety equipment 
this expenditure is funded from cash flow from operations 
specific capital expenditure we are undertaking capital projects at some of our locations 
one of these projects was started in and is expected to be completed in expenditures related to these specific projects are expected to total approximately million at atlantic aviation s existing fbo s and million at the trajen fbo s 
we intend to fund these expenditures from cash on hand 
bulk liquid storage terminal business maintenance capital expenditure during the year ended december   imtt spent million on maintenance capital expenditure  including million principally in relation to storage tank refurbishments and million on environmental capital expenditure  principally in relation to improvements in containment measures and remediation 
looking forward it is anticipated that total maintenance capital expenditure maintenance and environmental is unlikely to exceed a range of between million and million per year 
maintenance capital expenditure in was lower than this level due to the deferral of environmental capital expenditure into subsequent periods 
the expected level of future maintenance capital expenditure over the longer term primarily reflects the need for increased environmental expenditure going forward both to remediate existing sites and to upgrade waste water treatment and spill containment infrastructure to comply with existing  and currently foreseeable changes to  environmental regulations 
future maintenance capital expenditure is expected to be funded from imtt s cash flow from operations 
specific capital expenditure imtt is currently constructing a bulk liquid chemical storage and handling facility on the mississippi river at geismar  la 
to date  imtt has committed approximately million of growth capital expenditure to the project 
based on the current project scope and subject to certain minimum volumes of chemical products being handled by the facility  existing customer contracts are anticipated to generate terminal gross profit and ebitda of at least approximately million per year 
completion of construction of the initial million phase of the geismar project is targeted for the first quarter of in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  construction costs in the region affected by the hurricane have increased and labor shortages have been experienced 
although a significant amount of the impact of hurricane katrina on construction costs has already been incorporated into the capital commitment plan  there could be further negative impacts on the cost of constructing the geismar  la project which may not be offset by an increase in gross profit and ebitda contribution and or the project construction schedule 
in addition to the geismar project  imtt has recently completed the construction of seven new storage tanks and is currently in the process of constructing a further eight new storage tanks with a total capacity of approximately million barrels at its louisiana facilities at a total estimated cost of million 
it is anticipated that construction will be completed during rental contracts with initial terms of at least three years have already been executed in relation to of these tanks with the balance to be used to service customers while their existing tanks are undergoing scheduled maintenance over the next five years 
overall  it is anticipated that the operation of the new tanks will contribute approximately million to imtt s terminal gross profit and ebitda annually 
at the quebec facility  imtt is currently in the process of constructing four new storage tanks with total capacity of  barrels 
all of these tanks are already under customer contract with a minimum term of three years 
total construction costs are projected at approximately million 
construction of these tanks is anticipated to be completed during and their operation is anticipated to contribute approximately million to the quebec terminal s gross profit and ebitda annually 
during the year ended december   imtt spent million on specific expansion projects including million in relation to the construction the new bulk liquid chemical storage facility at geismar and million at st rose principally in relation to the construction of new storage tanks 
the balance of the specific capital expenditure related to a number of smaller projects to improve the capabilities of imtt s facilities 
it is anticipated that the proposed specific capital expenditure will be fully funded using a combination of imtt s cash flow from operations  imtt s debt facilities  the proceeds from our investment in imtt and future loans from the imtt shareholders other than us 
imtt s current debt facilities will need to be refinanced on amended terms and increased in size during to provide the funding necessary for imtt to fully pursue its expansion plans 
gas production and distribution business capital expenditure during  tgc expects to spend approximately million for maintenance  routine replacements of current facilities and equipment  and to support business growth in approximately million of the expected total year capital expenditures are for new business 
the remaining million comprises approximately million for vehicles and million for other renewals and upgrades 
a portion of this expenditure will be funded from available debt facilities 
district energy business maintenance capital expenditure our district energy business expects to spend approximately million per year on capital expenditures relating to the replacement of parts  system reliability  customer service improvements and minor system modifications 
since  minor system modifications have been made that increased system capacity by approximately  tons 
maintenance capital expenditures for the next year will be funded from available debt facilities 
specific capital expenditure we anticipate spending up to approximately million for system expansion over the next two years 
this expansion  in conjunction with operational strategies  and efficiencies we have achieved at our plants and throughout our system  will increase saleable capacity in the downtown cooling system by a total of  tons 
approximately  tons of saleable capacity was used in to accommodate four customers that converted from interruptible to continuous service 
the balance of saleable capacity approximately  tons is in the process of being sold to new or existing customers 
as of january   we have signed contracts with four customers representing approximately of the remaining additional saleable capacity 
one customer began service in late and the other three customers will begin service between and we have identified the likely purchasers of the remaining saleable capacity and expect to have contracts signed by the end of we estimate that we will incur additional capital expenditure of million connecting new customers to the system over the next two years 
typically  new customers will reimburse our district energy business for some  if not all  of these connection expenditures effectively reducing the impact of this capital expenditure 
we anticipate that the expanded capacity sold to new or existing customers will be under contract or subject to letters of intent prior to thermal committing to the capital expenditure 
approval from the city of chicago has been obtained where required to accommodate expansion of the underground distribution piping necessary to connect the above referenced anticipated new customers 
based on recent contract experience  each new ton of capacity sold will add approximately to annual revenue in the first year of service 
we expect to fund the capital expenditure for system expansion and interconnection by drawing on available debt facilities 
airport parking business maintenance capital expenditure maintenance capital projects include regular replacement of shuttle buses and it equipment  some of which are capital expenditures paid in cash and some of which are financed  including with capital leases 
as a result of the refinance and sale of surplus land  parking had additional funds available for capital expenditure 
these funds were used to accelerate capital expenditure previously scheduled for during  our airport parking business committed to maintenance related capital projects totaling million of which million was funded through debt and other financing activities 
the balance of million was paid in cash 
specific capital expenditure in  our airport parking business committed to  of specific capital projects  all of which was funded through debt and other financing activities 
in addition  the airport parking business spent  in on capital expenditures related to our sunpark facilities  all of which were prefunded at the time of our acquisition in commitments and contingencies the following tables summarize our future obligations  due by period  as of december   under our various contractual obligations and commitments 
we had no off balance sheet arrangement at that date or currently 
the following information does not include information for imtt  which is not consolidated 
payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations notes payable operating lease obligations time charter obligations pension benefit obligations post retirement benefit obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the long term debt represents the consolidated principal obligations to various lenders 
the debt facilities  which are obligations of the operating businesses and have maturities between and  are subject to certain covenants  the violation of which could result in acceleration 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources section for details on interest rates and interest rate hedges on our long term debt 
capital lease obligations are for the lease of certain transportation equipment 
such equipment could be subject to repossession upon violation of the terms of the lease agreements 
the company is obligated under non cancelable operating leases for various parking facilities at the airport parking business and for real estate leases at the district energy business 
this represents the minimum annual rentals required to be paid under such non cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year 
tgc currently has a time charter arrangement for the use of two barges for transporting liquefied petroleum gas between oahu and its neighbor islands 
purchase obligations include the commitment of the company through a wholly owned subsidiary to acquire of the membership interests in two fbos  located at stewart international airport in new york and santa monica airport in california  for million plus expected transaction costs  integration costs and reserves of million  net of expected debt of million 
the transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter or second quarter of this table does not reflect certain long term obligations  such as deferred taxes  for which we are unable to estimate the period in which the obligation will be incurred 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
these policies are consistent with the accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the airport services business  airport parking business  district energy business and gas production and distribution business include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  domain names  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks and domain names are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks  domain names and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks and domain names 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the airport services business  airport parking business  district energy business and gas production and distribution business are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks and domain names which are not amortized requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks and domain names is less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
property and equipment are initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in services assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in our airport services business  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount of the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so 
we test goodwill for impairment as of october each year 
there was no goodwill impairment as of october  we test our long lived assets when there is an indicator of impairment 
impairments of long lived assets during are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations airport parking business in part ii  item revenue recognition fuel revenue from our airport services business is recorded when fuel is provided or when services are rendered 
our airport services business also records hangar rental fees  which are recognized during the month for which service is provided 
our airport parking business records parking lot revenue  as services are performed  net of allowances and local taxes 
revenue for services performed  but not collected as of a reporting date  are recorded based upon the estimated value of uncollected parking revenue for customer vehicles at each location 
our airport parking business also offers various membership programs for which customers pay an annual membership fee 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the one year life of the membership 
revenue from prepaid parking vouchers that can be redeemed in the future is recognized when such vouchers are redeemed 
our district energy business recognizes revenue from cooling capacity and consumption at the time of performance of service 
cash received from customers for services to be provided in the future are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized over the expected services period on a straight line basis 
our gas production and distribution business recognizes revenue when the services are provided 
sales of gas to customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis 
most revenue is based upon consumption  however  certain revenue is based upon a flat rate 
hedging with respect to our debt facilities and the expected cash flows from our previously held non us investments  we have entered into a series of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to provide an economic hedge of our interest rate and foreign exchange exposure 
we originally classified each hedge as a cash flow hedge at inception for accounting purposes 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we subsequently determined that none of our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values and  for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting  that changes in the fair value of the derivative be recognized in earnings 
the determination of fair value of these instruments involves estimates and assumptions and actual value may differ from the fair value reflected in the financial statements 
we commenced hedge accounting in january and have classified each derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge as of january  changes in the value of the hedges  to the extent effective  will be recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
changes in the value that represent the ineffective portion of the hedge will be recorded in earnings as a gain or loss 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the discussion that follows describes our exposure to market risks and the use of derivatives to address those risks 
see critical accounting policies hedging for a discussion of the related accounting 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the borrowings of our businesses 
our current policy is to enter into derivative financial instruments to fix variable rate interest payments covering at least half of the interest rate risk associated with the borrowings of our businesses  subject to the requirements of our lenders 
as of december   we have total debt outstanding at our consolidated businesses of million 
of this total debt outstanding  million is fixed rate and million is floating 
of the million of floating rate debt  million is hedged with interest rate swaps  million is hedged with an interest rate cap and million is unhedged 
airport services business the senior debt for our airport services business comprises a non amortizing million floating rate facility maturing in a increase in the interest rate on the airport services business debt would result in a million increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
our airport services business exposure to interest rate changes has been hedged until december  through the use of interest rate swaps 
these hedging arrangements will offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates during that period 
however  if interest rates decrease  the value of our hedge instruments will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the hedge instruments of million 
a corresponding relative increase would result in a million increase in the fair market value 
bulk liquid storage terminal business imtt  at december   had two issues of tax exempt revenue bonds outstanding with a total balance of million where the interest rate is reset daily by tender 
a increase in interest rates on this tax exempt debt would result in a  increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes through the tax exempt debt has been largely hedged through october through the use of a million notional value interest rate swap 
as the interest rate swap is fixed against day libor and not the daily tax exempt tender rate  it does not result in a perfect hedge for short term rates on tax exempt debt although it will largely offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
the face value of the interest rate swap currently exceeds imtt s total outstanding floating rate debt as a consequence of repayment of debt subsequent to our investment in imtt 
if interest rates decrease  the value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of  and a corresponding relative increase would result in a  increase in the fair market value 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes through the tax exempt debt has been hedged from october through november through the use of a million face value of libor swap 
as this interest rate swap is fixed against of day libor and not the daily tax exempt tender rate  it does not result in a perfect hedge for short term rates on tax exempt debt although it will largely offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
if interest rates decrease  the value of this interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of  and a corresponding relative increase would result in a  increase in the fair market value 
imtt  at december   had million outstanding under its canadian dollar denominated revolving credit facility 
a increase in interest rates on this revolver would result in a  increase in interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt  at december   had a million floating rate term loan outstanding 
a increase in interest rates on the term loan would result in a million increase in interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes through the term loan has been fully hedged through the use of an amortizing interest rate swap 
these hedging arrangements will fully offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
however  if interest rates decrease  the value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of million 
a corresponding relative increase in interest rates would result in a million increase in the fair market value of the interest rate swap 
gas production and distribution business the senior term debt for tgc and hgc comprise two non amortizing term facilities totaling million and a senior secured revolving credit facility totaling million 
at december   the entire million in term debt and million of the revolving credit line had been drawn 
these variable rate facilities mature on august  a increase in the interest rate on tgc and hgc s term debt would result in a million increase in interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in annual interest cost 
tgc and hgc s exposure to interest rate changes has  however  been fully hedged from september  until maturity through interest rate swaps 
these derivative hedging arrangements will offset any interest rate increases or decreases during the term of the notes  resulting in stable interest rates of for tgc rising to in years and of the facility and for hgc rising to in years and of the facility 
tgc s and hgc s swaps were entered into on august and   but became effective on august  a relative decrease in market interest rates from december  levels would decrease the fair market value of the hedge instruments by million 
a corresponding relative increase would increase their fair market value by million 
district energy business our district energy business has issued million of aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior secured notes maturing december   with variable quarterly amortization commencing in the fourth quarter of we have a fixed rate exposure on these notes 
a relative increase in interest rates will result in a million decrease in the fair market value of the notes 
a relative decrease in interest rates will result in a million increase in the fair market value of the notes 
airport parking business our airport parking business has three senior debt facilities a million non amortizing floating rate facility maturing in if the options to extend are not exercised  a partially amortizing million fixed rate facility maturing in and a partially amortizing million fixed rated facility maturing in a increase in the interest rate on the million facility will increase the interest cost by million per year 
a decrease in interest rates will result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
a relative increase in interest rates will decrease the fair market value of the million facility by  a relative decrease in interest rates will result in a  increase in the fair market value 
a relative increase in interest rates will increase the fair market value of the million facility by  a relative decrease in interest rates will result in a  decrease in the fair market value 
we purchased an interest rate cap agreement at a base rate of libor equal to for a notional amount of million 
we have also entered into an interest rate swap agreement for the million balance of our floating rate facility at through october  and for the full million once our interest rate cap expires through the maturity of the loan on september  pcaa s obligations under the interest rate swap have been guaranteed by mic inc a relative decrease in market interest rates from december  levels would decrease the fair market value of the hedge instruments by million 
a corresponding relative increase would increase their fair market value by million 
in relation to the interest rate cap instruments  the day libor rate as at december  was  compared to our interest rate cap of a libor rate of 
we reached the interest rate caps in the first quarter of commodity risk our district energy business is exposed to the risk of fluctuating electricity prices which is not fully offset by escalation provisions in our contracts with customers 
in light of the current uncertainty surrounding electricity pricing  particularly given the upcoming deregulation of the illinois electricity markets and pending rate cases  and the resulting potential changes in our contract pricing provisions  we are unable at this time to reasonably perform a sensitivity analysis regarding changes in electricity prices
