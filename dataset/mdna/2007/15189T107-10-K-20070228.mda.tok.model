our principal cash requirements for include the following approximately billion of capital expenditures  cash settlement obligations in connection with possible conversions by holders of our convertible senior notes  having an aggregate principal amount of million  dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock and debt service payments  settlement of our convertible senior notes for million and settlement of our junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures for million  as discussed in notes b and to our consolidated financial statements  and million of maturing long term debt  including million of transition bonds 
we expect that long term debt securities issued in the first quarter of million  borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
cash needs may also be met by issuing equity or debt securities in the capital markets

convertible debt 
as of december   the convertible senior notes discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements have been included as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets because the last reported sale price of centerpoint energy common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the fourth quarter of was greater than or equal to of the conversion price of the convertible senior notes and therefore  during the first quarter of  the convertible senior notes meet the criteria that make them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of these notes 

table of contents as of december   our convertible senior notes discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements were included as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets because in december  we called our convertible senior notes for redemption on january  junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities 
as of december   our junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements have been included as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets because in december  we called our junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures for redemption in february arkansas public service commissions  affiliate transaction rulemaking proceeding 
in arkansas  the apsc in december adopted rules governing affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in arkansas 
the rules treat as affiliate transactions all transactions between cerc s arkansas utility operations and other divisions of cerc  as well as transactions between the arkansas utility operations and affiliates of cerc 
all such affiliate transactions are required to be priced under an asymmetrical pricing formula under which the arkansas utility operations would benefit from any difference between the cost of providing goods and services to or from the arkansas utility operations and the market value of those goods or services 
additionally  the arkansas utility operations are not permitted to participate in any financing other than to finance retail utility operations in arkansas  which would preclude continuation of existing financing arrangements in which cerc finances its divisions and subsidiaries  including its arkansas utility operations 
although the arkansas rules are now in effect  cerc and other gas and electric utilities operating in arkansas sought reconsideration of the rules by the apsc 
in february  the apsc granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the rules in order to permit time for additional consideration 
if the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration  cerc would be entitled to seek judicial review 
in adopting the rules  the apsc indicated that affiliate transactions and financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in compliance until december   and that utilities may seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules 
if the rules ultimately become effective as presently adopted  cerc would need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or would be required to make significant modifications to existing practices  which could include the formation of and transfer of assets to subsidiaries 
if this regulatory framework becomes effective  it could have adverse impacts on cerc s ability to operate and provide cost effective utility service 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases and the guaranties described below  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
prior to our distribution of our ownership in rri to our shareholders  cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri s trading subsidiary 
under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies  rri agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation  but at the time of separation in september  rri had been unable to extinguish all obligations 
to secure us and cerc against obligations under the remaining guaranties  rri agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of cerc and us  and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties 
cerc currently holds letters of credit in the amount of million issued on behalf of rri against guaranties that have not been released 
our current exposure under the guaranties relates to cerc s guaranty of the payment by rri of demand charges related to transportation contracts with one counterparty 
the demand charges are approximately million per year through  million in  million in and million in rri continues to meet its obligations under the transportation contracts  and we believe current market conditions make those contracts valuable for transportation services in the near term 
however  changes in market conditions could affect the value of those contracts 
if rri should fail to perform its obligations under the transportation contracts  our exposure to the counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security provided by rri 
we have requested rri to increase the amount of its existing letters of credit or  in the alternative  to obtain a release of cerc s obligations under the guaranty 
in june  the rri trading subsidiary and cerc jointly filed a complaint at the ferc against the counterparty on the cerc guaranty 
in the complaint  the rri trading subsidiary seeks a determination by the ferc that the security demanded by the counterparty exceeds the level permitted by the ferc s policies 
the complaint asks the ferc to require the counterparty to release cerc from its guaranty obligation and  in its place  accept i a guaranty from rri of the obligations of the rri trading subsidiary  and 
table of contents ii letters of credit limited to a one year of demand charges for a transportation agreement related to a expansion of the counterparty s pipeline  and b three months of demand charges for three other transportation agreements held by the rri trading subsidiary 
the counterparty has argued that the amount of the guaranty does not violate the ferc s policies and that the proposed substitution of credit support is not authorized under the counterparty s financing documents or required by the ferc s policy 
the parties have now completed their submissions to the ferc regarding the complaint 
we cannot predict what action the ferc may take on the complaint or when the ferc may rule 
in addition to the ferc proceeding  in february centerpoint and cerc made a formal demand on rri under procedures provided for by the master separation agreement  dated as of december   between reliant energy  incorporated and reliant resources  inc that demand seeks to resolve the disagreement with rri over the amount of security rri is obligated to provide with respect to this guaranty 
it is possible that this demand could lead to an arbitration proceeding between the companies  but when and on what terms the disagreement with rri will ultimately be resolved cannot now be predicted

the facility contains covenants  including a debt to total capitalization covenant of 
under each of the credit facilities  an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings any time more than of the facility is utilized  and the spread to libor fluctuates based on the borrower s credit rating 
borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions 
however  there is no requirement that we  centerpoint houston or cerc corp 
make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect 
borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we  centerpoint houston or cerc corp 
consider customary 
in october  the termination date of cerc s receivables facility was extended to october the facility size was million until december  is million from december to may and ranges 
table of contents from million to million during the period from may to the october  termination date of the facility 
we  centerpoint houston and cerc corp

the commercial paper is rated not prime by moody s investors service  inc moody s  a by standard poor s rating services s p  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  and f by fitch  inc fitch and  as a result  we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short term borrowing requirements 
we cannot assure you that these ratings  or the credit ratings set forth below in impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings  will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies

temporary investments 
as of december   we had external temporary investments of less than million 
as of february   we had external temporary investments of million 
money pool 
we have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short term basis 
funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position 
the net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under centerpoint energy s revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper 
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings 
as of february   moody s  s p  and fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries moody s s p fitch company instrument rating outlook rating outlook rating outlook centerpoint energy senior unsecured debt ba stable bbb stable bbb stable centerpoint houston senior secured debt first mortgage bonds baa stable bbb stable a stable cerc corp 
senior unsecured debt baa stable bbb stable bbb stable a stable outlook from moody s indicates that moody s does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed 

table of contents an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a stable outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our billion credit facility  centerpoint houston s million credit facility and cerc corp 
s million credit facility 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
additionally  a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments 
in september  we issued zens having an original principal amount of billion of which million remain outstanding 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc common stock tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common equal to approximately of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the zens notes and tw common shares become current tax obligations when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common shares are sold 
the ultimate tax obligation related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of zens notes maturing or being retired 
centerpoint energy services  inc ces  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp 
operating in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states 
in order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry  including those pertaining to credit thresholds 
typically  the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces 
to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold  ces is not obligated to provide collateral 
mark to market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces 
as of december   the amount posted as collateral amounted to million 
should the credit ratings of cerc corp 
the credit support provider for ces fall below certain levels  ces would be required to provide additional collateral on two business days notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly lower 
in addition  cerc corp 
and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of million based on cerc corp 
s s p senior unsecured long term debt rating of bbb 
upgrades and downgrades from this bbb rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly 
in connection with the development of the southeast supply header  cerc corp 
has committed that it will advance funds to the joint venture or cause funds to be advanced  up to million  for its percent share of the cost to construct the pipeline 
cerc corp 
also agreed to provide a letter of credit in the amount of its share of funds which have not been advanced in the event s p reduces cerc corp 
s bond rating below investment grade before cerc corp 
has advanced the required construction funds 
however  cerc corp 
is relieved of these commitments i to the extent of percent of any borrowing agreements that the joint venture has obtained and maintains for funding the construction of the pipeline and ii to the extent cerc corp 
or its subsidiary participating in the joint venture obtains committed borrowing agreements pursuant to which funds may be borrowed and used for the construction of the pipeline 
a similar commitment has been provided by the other party to the joint venture 
cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will 
table of contents cause a default 
in addition  six outstanding series of our senior notes  aggregating billion in principal amount as of february   provide that a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million  will cause a default 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including gas purchases  gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments  particularly given gas price levels and volatility  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities  various regulatory actions  the ability of rri and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of centerpoint houston and in respect of rri s indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which cerc is a guarantor  slower customer payments and increased write offs of receivables due to higher gas prices  cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent conversion rights of holders of convertible debt  the outcome of litigation brought by and against us  contributions to benefit plans  restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes  and various other risks identified in risk factors in item a of this report

table of contents critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
our electric transmission distribution business applies sfas no 
 which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our former electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of sfas no 
with respect to our electric transmission distribution business segment relate to million of recoverable electric generation related regulatory assets as of december  these costs are recoverable under the provisions of the texas electric choice plan 
based on our analysis of the final order issued by the texas utility commission  we recorded an after tax charge to earnings in of approximately million to write down our electric generation related regulatory assets to their realizable value  which was reflected as an extraordinary loss 
based on subsequent orders received from the texas utility commission  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after tax in the second quarter of related to the regulatory asset 
additionally  a district court in travis county  texas issued a judgment that would have the effect of restoring approximately million  plus interest  of disallowed costs 
centerpoint houston and other parties appealed the district court judgment 
oral arguments before the texas rd court of appeals were held in january  but a decision is not expected for several months 
no amounts related to the district court s judgment have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of july  unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 

table of contents fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
asset retirement obligations we account for our long lived assets under sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
fin 
sfas no 
and fin require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in the same period  the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
rate regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with sfas no 
and fin  and costs recovered through the ratemaking process 
we estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components inflation adjustment the estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor  equipment  materials  and other disposal costs  discount rate the estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium  and third party markup adjustments internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset 
changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under sfas no 
and fin for example  if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate by basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage 
at december   our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately million 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to the sale and or delivery of electricity or natural gas energy are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant 
table of contents impact to the amount of pension expense recorded 
please read other significant matters pension plans for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements see note o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
other significant matters pension plans 
as discussed in note p to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory qualified pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa and the internal revenue code 
although we were not required to make contributions to our qualified pension plan in or  we made a voluntary contribution of million in additionally  we maintain an unfunded non qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated 
employer contributions for the non qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires us  as the sponsor of a plan  to a recognize on our balance sheets as an asset a plan s over funded status or as a liability such plan s under funded status  b measure a plan s assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
as of december   we recorded a regulatory asset of million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive income of million  net of tax 
for additional information regarding the implementation of sfas no 
 see note o 
at december   the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans exceeded the market value of plan assets by million 
changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions 
pension costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in addition  included in the costs for and are million and less than million  respectively  of expense related to texas genco participants 
pension expense for texas genco participants is reflected in our statement of consolidated operations as discontinued operations 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the 
table of contents assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   our qualified pension plan had an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of december  we believe that our actual asset allocation  on average  will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a increase from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
currently  pension plan assets including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceed the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
however  if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december  by million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in of million  net of tax 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 

table of contents derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding long term debt  bank loans  mandatory redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely our junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities  some lease obligations and our obligations under our zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
our floating rate obligations aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would increase by approximately million 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities and trust preferred securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective january   the zens obligation was bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  was a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  a million recorded liability at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated operations and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on our zens obligation and our historical accounting treatment of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
commodity price risk from non trading activities we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
at december   the recorded fair value of our non trading energy derivatives was a net liability of million 
the net liability consisted of a million net liability associated with gas operations price stabilization activities partially offset by a net asset of million related to our competitive natural gas sales and services business 
net assets or liabilities related to gas operations price stabilization activities 
table of contents correspond directly with net over under recovered gas cost liabilities or assets on the balance sheet 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
we have a risk oversight committee composed of corporate and business segment officers  that oversees our commodity price and credit risk activities  including our trading  marketing  risk management services and hedging activities 
the committee s duties are to establish commodity risk policies  allocate risk capital within limits established by our board of directors  approve trading of new products and commodities  monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with our risk management policies and procedures and trading limits established by our board of directors 
our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments 
a leveraged financial instrument  for this purpose  is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument
