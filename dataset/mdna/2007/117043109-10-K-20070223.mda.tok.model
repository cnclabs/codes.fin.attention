certain other statements in management s discussion and analysis are forward looking as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from expectations as of the date of this filing because of factors discussed in item a of this annual report on form k 
overview and outlook general in  brunswick made significant progress toward achieving its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine  fitness and bowling billiards industries by introducing high quality and reliable products with innovative and new technologies in all of brunswick s market segments  distributing products through a model that benefits the company s dealers and distributors by providing additional products and services that will make them more successful  improve the customer experience and  in turn  make brunswick more successful  focusing on cost reduction initiatives through global sourcing and realignment of brunswick s manufacturing operations and organizational structure  continuing to expand and enhance brunswick s global manufacturing footprint to achieve best cost positions  and acquiring and investing in businesses that will expand and enhance brunswick s product offerings  particularly in boats and parts accessories 
while these activities are ongoing  brunswick continued to see positive overall results from its efforts reflected in its financial performance despite difficult marine market conditions 
sales in from continuing operations increased percent to  million  with gains reported by the boat and fitness segments 
the increase in sales was primarily due to marine acquisitions and higher sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from reduced demand levels across the us marine industry 
excluding incremental sales of million from acquisitions  the company s sales from continuing operations declined percent from operating earnings from continuing operations for of million  and operating margins of percent  decreased from  primarily as a result of higher raw material and production costs  unfavorable mix factors  the marine engine market s transition to low emission engines  which carry lower margins  and lower fixed cost absorption due to reduced production rates in brunswick s marine businesses to achieve appropriate levels of dealer pipeline inventories 
also contributing to the decline in both operating earnings and margins was a million pre tax restructuring charge recorded during the fourth quarter 
as discussed in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements  total pre tax restructuring charges recognized during the fourth quarter under this initiative were million per diluted share  of which the remaining balance of million was related to asset write downs associated with a joint venture and recorded against equity earnings 
these factors were partially offset by successful cost reduction initiatives  the effects of higher pricing and acquisitions and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the company also incurred additional costs for investments in research and development  marketing for new product launches and international operations to support future growth 
see the results of operations section below for further discussion 
accomplishments in support of the company s strategic objectives in include new products the continued rollout of mercury marine s verado  a family of supercharged four stroke outboard engines  into smaller naturally aspirated four cylinder models ranging from to horsepower  complementing the larger six cylinder supercharged models  ranging from to horsepower  the debut of single cylinder and horsepower four stroke outboard engines  allowing mercury marine to offer a full line of four stroke engines from horsepower through the horsepower verado  introduction of two new direct injected optimax two stroke outboard engines with and horsepower  new boat models across all boat divisions  many of which utilize brunswick s high performance product development hppd process to integrate the design  engineering and manufacturing processes from start to finish  new cardiovascular and strength training fitness product offerings  including the t and t treadmill series and the summit trainer  designed to simplify and enhance the workout experience  opening of a state of the art research and development lab in life fitness franklin park  illinois  facility  which is being used to drive innovation and future product improvements  launch of vivo  life fitness new wireless connectivity technology that integrates health clubs  fitness equipment  and exercisers to provide a more personalized workout experience by allowing users to record workout data and track progress toward their goals  and allowing health clubs to obtain enhanced data on usage and programs to better market them to their customers  and continued expansion of the larger brunswick zone xl family bowling entertainment centers 
manufacturing realignment consolidation of certain boat manufacturing facilities  sales offices and distribution centers to streamline operations  including the transfer of lund canada production from steinbach  manitoba  canada  to lund s new york mills  minnesota  facility  and the transfer of a portion of us marine s bayliner production from one of its two cumberland  maryland  plants to its operations in pipestone  minnesota  streamlined organizational structure across the boat group to advance the integration of brunswick s marine operations and enhance the ability to achieve new efficiencies and networking competencies  commenced bowling ball manufacturing operations in reynosa  mexico  to which the transition from muskegon  michigan  will be completed in  and announcement of the relocation of brunswick s valley dynamo manufacturing operations from richland hills  texas  to reynosa  mexico  where production is expected to commence in early to mid acquisitions purchase of cabo yachts  which complements the sportfishing convertibles offered by brunswick s albemarle and hatteras brands  the three of which now comprise the hatteras collection  acquisition of diversified marine  which adds significant capacity to brunswick s parts and accessories business and provides an essential distribution hub in the western united states  and acquisition of blue water dealer services  allowing brunswick to offer a more complete line of financial services to its boat and marine engine dealers and their customers 
international operations increased investments in operations in europe  the pacific rim and latin america supporting international sales  which now represent approximately percent of net sales from continuing operations  and purchase of an additional percent of the outstanding stock of protokon  a hungarian fitness equipment manufacturer  which allows brunswick to better service fitness customers in europe 
returning value to shareholders continued purchases under a million share repurchase program  buying back approximately million shares of brunswick common stock for approximately million during  and maintaining an annual dividend payment of per share 
discontinued operations as discussed in note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on april   the company announced its intention to sell the majority of the brunswick new technologies bnt business unit  which consists of the company s marine electronics  portable navigation device pnd and wireless fleet tracking businesses 
these bnt businesses have become increasingly concentrated in markets outside of the company s core business segments marine  fitness  bowling and billiards and continued growth requires significant investment to ensure successful new product introductions 
the company believes that bnt s long term prospects may be better under different ownership 
in december  brunswick announced that increasingly challenging market conditions and pricing pressures in the highly competitive pnd business were adversely affecting the operating performance of bnt and the company s ability to sell bnt at or above book value 
based on the performance of the pnd and marine electronics operations and discussions with potential buyers  the company concluded that proceeds from the sale of bnt will be less than its book value 
these conditions resulted in a pre tax non cash asset impairment charge of million  million after tax  in the fourth quarter of the after tax impairment amount includes the reversal of previously recorded tax benefited operating losses that are no longer expected to be recoverable 
in february  brunswick announced that it had signed definitive agreements to sell bnt s marine electronics and pnd businesses 
the company is continuing to pursue the sale of the wireless fleet tracking business 
during the second quarter of  brunswick began reporting the results of these bnt businesses  which were previously reported in the marine engine segment  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company s results  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis  reflect continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
outlook for looking ahead to  the company expects domestic retail demand for marine products to continue to decrease in the low to mid single digit percentages 
as a result of this reduction in retail demand  brunswick will continue its efforts to achieve appropriate levels of dealer inventories by reducing production of boats and marine engines 
the company anticipates that sales will benefit from the introduction of new products and the full year benefit of businesses acquired in  along with favorable pricing 
considering all of these factors  marine sales are expected to be down slightly as compared with sales for in both the fitness and bowling billiards segments are expected to increase in the low to mid single digit percentages 
overall  reported sales for are expected to be relatively flat  plus or minus a couple of percentage points 
operating earnings and margins for will be adversely affected by the continued production declines  as discussed above 
these actions will have an unfavorable effect on margins due to lower fixed cost absorption and an unfavorable product mix  as production cutbacks will be greater in certain higher margin boat categories 
these factors  along with continued increases in raw materials  production  and freight and distribution costs and restored variable compensation costs  are not expected to be offset by improvements in pricing  growth in international marine operations and cost containment efforts during brunswick s effective tax rate in is expected to be approximately percent  excluding the effect of any non recurring tax items that may occur 
matters affecting comparability as described above  certain statements in management s discussion and analysis are based on non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
operating and statistical measures are not non gaap financial measures 
the company has used the non gaap financial measures that are included in management s discussion and analysis for several years 
brunswick s management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view brunswick s performance using the same tools that brunswick uses and to better evaluate its ongoing business performance 
brunswick s management believes that for the years ended december   and  the presentation of i diluted earnings per share excluding non recurring tax benefits in  and and an investment sale gain in the first quarter of  ii net sales excluding acquisitions not reflected in the prior year s results  iii the company s financial results excluding the effect of restructuring charges incurred during  and iv the company s effective tax rate excluding the effect of non recurring tax benefits and the investment sale  provide a more meaningful comparison to prior results

tax items and investment sale gain 
the comparison of net earnings per diluted share between  and  is affected by tax items and the gain on the sale of an investment  which are described below 
the effect of these items on diluted earnings per share is as follows net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share as reported tax items investment sale gain net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share as adjusted management believes that the presentation of earnings per diluted share  excluding these items  provides a more meaningful comparison of current and prior year results because these items are unique to their respective fiscal years tax items during  the company reduced its tax provision primarily due to million of tax benefits per diluted share  consisting of million of tax reserve reassessments of underlying exposures and the recognition of a million interest receivable related to the completion of irs audits of prior taxable years 
refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail

 accounting for income taxes special areas apb  to the undistributed net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company determined that approximately million of undistributed net earnings from continuing operations  as well as the future net earnings  of these foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside of the united states 
these earnings will provide brunswick with the opportunity to continue to expand its global manufacturing footprint  fund future growth in foreign locations and shift brunswick s acquisition focus to europe and asia 
the company s current intentions satisfy the indefinite reversal criterion of apb in addition  brunswick s tax rate benefited from the utilization of previously unrecognized loss carryforwards applied in connection with the marinemax investment sale gain discussed below

total pre tax restructuring charges were million  with the remaining million balance recorded against equity earnings 
see note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these changes 
vs 
the increase in sales was primarily due to acquisitions completed in and in the boat and marine engine segments  higher fitness segment sales resulting from increased sales volumes and improved product mix  and sales gains at bowling retail centers 
excluding incremental sales of million from acquisitions  sales decreased percent in  primarily due to lower retail demand for marine products compared with  especially with respect to sales of domestic outboard engines and fiberglass boats 
these decreases were partially offset by growth in non us sales in the boat  marine engine and fitness segments  as well as favorable pricing 
non us sales increased million to  million in  with the largest contributions coming from the latin american region  which increased million to million  and the africa and middle east region  which increased million to million 
this growth was largely attributable to higher sales of fitness equipment  boats and outboard engines 
brunswick s gross margin percentage decreased basis points in to percent from percent in this decrease was the result of higher raw material and component costs  lower fixed cost absorption and inefficiencies due to reduced production rates as a result of the company s effort to achieve appropriate levels of marine customer pipeline inventories in light of lower retail demand  and the full year effect of the transition to low emission outboard engines  which carry lower margins than the carbureted two stroke outboards they replaced 
gross margin also decreased due to a shift in product mix  as sales volumes decreased in some of the higher margin fiberglass boat lines  and higher sales from acquired businesses  which have lower margins than brunswick s core brands 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin percentage was a restructuring charge of million recorded during the fourth quarter of for severance costs  asset write downs and other costs associated with workforce reductions  plant shutdowns and distribution realignment actions 
total pre tax restructuring charges recognized during the fourth quarter under this initiative were million  of which million was recorded in operating expenses 
the remaining balance of million was related to asset write downs associated with a joint venture and recorded against equity earnings 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable pricing and lower variable compensation expense 
operating expenses increased million to million in  primarily due to the effect of acquisitions  the million restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of as discussed above  the unfavorable effect of inflation on wages and benefits  the absence of a reduction in marine engine segment bad debt reserves that occurred in the third quarter of resulting from improved credit experience in international markets  a reduction in gains associated with the sale of bowling centers  and increased investments in research and development expenses  particularly in the marine engine and fitness segments 
these increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense  a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier on environmental coverage  the absence of legal expenses incurred in related to a dispute with a supplier in china as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  lower costs associated with the transition of bowling ball production from michigan to reynosa  mexico  and other cost reduction initiatives 
excluding incremental operating expenses of million from acquisitions and the million restructuring charge  operating expenses decreased percent from the prior year 
operating earnings decreased to million in from million in the decrease in operating earnings was mainly due to the decline in sales volumes and the factors affecting gross margin and operating expenses discussed above 
the decrease was partially offset by contributions from acquisitions  the benefit of a weaker dollar and cost reduction initiatives 
in the first quarter of  brunswick sold  shares of common stock of marinemax  its largest boat dealer 
proceeds from this stock sale totaled million  net of million of selling expenses  which included million of accrued expenses 
brunswick recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale 
refer to note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the sale of this investment 
interest expense increased million in compared with  primarily due to additional interest incurred on the million floating rate notes issued in july  as described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  coupled with the unfavorable effects of higher short term interest rates compared with the prior year 
interest income increased million in from due to a higher average invested cash balance as a result of proceeds from the floating rate notes issuance during the second half of  as well as increasing rates of return on invested cash balances 
brunswick s effective tax rate in decreased to percent from percent in  mostly due to higher non recurring tax benefits in compared with the prior year 
during the year ended december   the company recognized non recurring tax benefits of million  consisting of million of tax reserve reassessments of underlying exposures and recording an additional tax receivable of million for interest related to prior taxable years as the claims were filed in the current year  as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding tax benefits  the company s effective tax rate for was percent 
in  the company recognized million of non recurring tax benefits  primarily due to refinements in the calculation of prior years extraterritorial income tax benefit  the reassessment of tax reserves for underlying exposures and the company s apb assertion to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  as discussed above 
in addition  brunswick utilized previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards on the gain on the sale of marinemax stock as discussed above 
the tax rate was further affected by foreign earnings in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
refer to note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details with respect to these tax benefits 
excluding these non recurring tax benefits  the company s effective tax rate for was percent 
both the and effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate as a result of the research and development tax credit and the extraterritorial income tax benefit 
management believes that presentation of the effective tax rate  excluding the non recurring tax benefits in and and the investment sale gain in  provides a more meaningful comparison because these tax benefits are unique to their respective periods 
net earnings and diluted earnings per share decreased primarily due to the same factors discussed above in operating earnings 
excluding the million and million of non recurring tax benefits in and discussed above  respectively  and the gain on the sale of brunswick s investment in marinemax reported in  diluted earnings per share would have been and per diluted share for and  respectively 
management believes that presentation of diluted earnings per share  excluding the non recurring tax benefits and the investment sale gain  provides a more meaningful comparison to the prior period because these items are unique to their respective periods 
weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share decreased to million in from million in the decrease in average shares outstanding was primarily due to the repurchase of approximately million shares during  as well as the full year benefit of share repurchases  as discussed in note share repurchase program in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales from discontinued operations decreased to million in from million in  as bnt took necessary discounting and promotional actions to meet competitive pricing pressures  especially in the european consumer portable navigation device market 
pre tax operating losses from discontinued operations in  before impairment  were million  compared with pre tax operating earnings of million in in addition to the factors affecting sales  the reduction in pre tax operating earnings from discontinued operations was also due to efforts to reduce inventory for bnt as well as for its dealers and to maintain competitive pricing in anticipation of new product launches in late  in addition to certain investment write offs that were recorded during the year 
additionally  based on brunswick s december announcement that the proceeds from the sale of bnt were expected to be less than its book value at that time  bnt recognized a non cash impairment charge of million  million after tax  in the fourth quarter of the after tax impairment amount reflects the reversal of previously recorded tax benefited operating losses 
vs 
the increase in sales in was due to higher boat  marine engine and bowling billiards segment sales performance 
approximately percent of the increase in sales was from organic growth  defined as sales from the company s businesses that have operating results in comparable periods presented 
the remaining growth was due to acquisitions completed in and both the boat and marine engine segments benefited from an improved marine market  particularly in the first half of the year  and higher pricing in organic sales growth from the boat segment resulted from higher wholesale shipments to boat dealers domestically and internationally  favorable pricing and a positive mix shift to higher priced cruisers and sportyachts 
marine engine segment sales increased primarily due to higher revenues from outboard engines and sterndrives as a result of growth in non us markets and growth in mercury marine s parts and service business

the increase in boat segment sales was mainly attributable to acquisitions completed in and excluding incremental sales of million from acquired businesses  organic boat segment sales declined by percent from the prior year  primarily due to reduced marine retail demand in domestic markets  as well as lower shipments to dealers in an effort to achieve appropriate levels of pipeline inventories 
increased promotional incentives  particularly for some higher margin fiberglass boat lines  also contributed to lower sales 
the sales decrease was partially offset by favorable pricing and improved sales in non us markets  most notably canada and latin america 
excluding incremental operating expenses of million from acquisitions  boat segment operating expenses decreased percent from the prior year 
boat segment operating earnings decreased from as the favorable effect of slightly higher sales  together with successful cost control efforts and lower variable compensation expense  was more than offset by lower fixed cost absorption as a result of reduced production levels across the segment s brands  an unfavorable shift in product mix as sales volumes decreased in some of the higher margin fiberglass boat lines  higher raw material and production costs and increased freight expenses 
in addition  a million restructuring charge was recorded against boat segment operating earnings during the fourth quarter of  related to the consolidation of certain us marine and lund boat manufacturing facilities  sales offices and distribution centers to streamline operations

vs 
sales from the acquisitions completed in and accounted for approximately percent of the increase in segment sales in organic sales growth  driven by an improved marine market  particularly in the first half of  resulted from higher wholesale shipments to both domestic and international boat dealers  favorable pricing across most fiberglass boat brands and a positive mix shift to higher priced cruisers and sportyachts 
these sales increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes of aluminum boats as a result of weak market conditions in the upper midwest and actions taken by the company to reduce dealer inventory levels 
the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the increase in sales  successful cost reduction initiatives and operational efficiencies 
operating earnings also benefited from the favorable mix shift to more profitable cruisers and sportyachts and the completion in of the amortization of an intangible asset from the acquisition of sea ray 
partially offsetting these favorable factors were higher research and development expenses and raw material costs 
operating earnings were also adversely affected by lower fixed cost absorption during the second half of  resulting from the decrease in production volumes necessary to maintain healthy boat pipeline inventories  most notably for the aluminum boat brands 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to tooling for the production of new models  the acquisition of a boat plant in north carolina to expand capacity for the production of hatteras sportfishing convertibles and motoryachts  the expansion of a boat manufacturing plant in reynosa  mexico  and capital spending related to the acquisitions described above

sales recorded by the marine engine segment  which is comprised of the mercury marine group  decreased slightly from  mainly due to a decline in domestic outboard engine sales volume compared with a stronger marine environment in the prior year  as well as efforts to reduce pipeline inventories held by customers 
these factors were partially offset by higher engine pricing  international sales growth  especially in european and latin american markets  an acquisition completed in  a greater mix of low emission outboard engines  which have higher prices  and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the decrease in operating earnings for the marine engine segment was largely attributable to the lower sales volumes discussed above  as well as higher raw material costs  lower fixed cost absorption due to reduced production levels to maintain appropriate dealer and customer pipeline inventories  the full year effect of the mix shift to low emission outboard engines  the absence of a reduction in bad debt reserves that occurred in the third quarter of resulting from improved credit experience in international markets  and costs to ramp up asian manufacturing facilities 
the positive effects of lower variable compensation expense  successful cost reduction initiatives  a gain on the sale of property in the first quarter of and a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier on environmental coverage in the second quarter were partially offset by higher research and development expenses 
in addition  a million restructuring charge was recorded against marine engine segment operating earnings during the fourth quarter of  primarily related to severance costs  asset write downs and other expenses associated with actions to improve the company s cost structure and streamline sales operations 
the decrease in capital expenditures was largely due to investments in for the development of the new line of  and horsepower naturally aspirated four stroke outboard engines  as well as the completion of tooling for the four cylinder supercharged verado engines 
the decrease was partially offset by expenditures in for the completion of a second four stroke outboard production line and plant expansions for die cast operations  as well as investments in information technology 
vs 
in  marine engine segment sales increased primarily due to higher revenues from outboard engines and sterndrives as a result of growth in international markets  a greater sales mix of low emission outboard engines  which have higher prices  and growth in the marine parts and service business 
in addition to the factors benefiting sales  the increase in marine engine segment operating earnings was primarily due to successful cost containment actions  reduced warranty costs as a result of quality improvements  a reduction in bad debt reserves due to improved international credit experience  as well as the improved financial condition of certain domestic customers  and lower variable compensation costs

environmental regulation in its marine engine segment  brunswick will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the state of california has adopted regulations requiring catalytic converters on sterndrive and inboard engines by january  other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries may also impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect 
the company expects to comply fully with these regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on brunswick s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on brunswick s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats  marine engines  fitness equipment  bowling products and billiards tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities and rebates 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability and revenue is adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivables for brunswick s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance result in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
all accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
the liability is estimated based on claims incurred as of the date of the financial statements 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves 
pension  postretirement and postemployment costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no

   and r 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company historically provided deferred taxes on the undistributed net earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
as of july   the company determined that certain foreign subsidiaries undistributed net earnings were to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the united states  and accordingly  us income taxes are no longer provided for the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries 
the company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s application of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the company s tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease

 fair value measurements  sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements
