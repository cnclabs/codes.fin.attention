the estimates and certain other statements below are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements and the adequacies of our available funds will depend on many factors  including those under risk factors 
overview we are a life sciences company committed to advancing personalized medicine and improving patient outcomes through the development of innovative molecular diagnostic products that guide and target the most appropriate treatments 
through a comprehensive understanding of the genetics  biology and pathology of particular diseases  we have pioneered and are developing molecular diagnostics and laboratory services that are designed to enable physicians to better manage infectious diseases and cancers by providing the critical information that helps them prescribe personalized treatments for patients by matching the underlying molecular features of an individual patient s disease to the drug expected to have maximal therapeutic benefit  and enable pharmaceutical companies to develop new and improved anti viral therapeutics and targeted cancer therapeutics more efficiently and cost effectively by providing enhanced patient selection and monitoring capabilities throughout the development process 
we are a leader in developing and commercializing innovative products that help guide and improve the treatment of infectious diseases  cancer and other serious diseases 
our goal with personalized medicine is to enable the management of diseases at the individual patient level through the use of sophisticated diagnostics that permit the targeting of therapeutics to those patients most likely to respond to or benefit from them  thereby offering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time 
our phenosense and geneseq products provide a practical method for measuring the impact of genetic mutations on human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  drug resistance 
this information is used to optimize various treatment options for the individual patient 
we currently market phenotypic and genotypic resistance testing products directed at patients with hiv infection and the drug classes currently approved for use 
in addition  we have resistance tests in development or already in research use that are relevant to new drug classes  such as the integrase  entry and assembly classes 
in addition to these resistance tests  our trofile co receptor tropism assay has been used for patient selection in the phase iii trials of the new class of ccr antagonists 
the first of these  maraviroc from pfizer  is currently the subject of an nda that has been accepted for priority review by the fda 
we expect that the trofile assay may be used for patient selection after regulatory approval of maraviroc and other ccr antagonists 
over the last several years  we have built a business based on the personalized medicine approach in hiv drug resistance testing and in patient selection 
we now seek to leverage the experience and infrastructure we have built in the hiv market to the potentially larger market opportunity of cancer utilizing our proprietary etag technology  in the future  we plan to seek opportunities to address an even broader range of serious diseases 
new targeted drug therapies are being introduced for the treatment of cancer 
our proprietary etag technology provides an assay platform for analyzing very small amounts of tumor samples recovered and prepared in a variety of methods  including formalin fixation  the current standard technique in hospital pathology laboratories 
we believe this analytical platform may be well suited for the next generation of targeted cancer therapeutics 
we believe that  upon completion of development  our etag assays will permit the prediction  with a high degree of accuracy  of the likelihood of a patient s cancer responding to a given therapy  
table of contents facilitating the selection of more precise and effective therapeutic options 
we are developing epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr her  etag assays that we believe will enable physicians to identify the appropriate course of treatment for cancers that have a particular molecular profile 
our current focus is on drugs that target the egfr her receptor family  initially in breast cancer but subsequently in lung and other cancers 
we intend to develop etag assays that target other protein drug targets and signaling pathways that are key drivers of proliferation or survival in cancer cells 
we have incurred losses each year since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  including a charge in of million for in process research and development related to our merger with aclara 
we expect to incur additional operating losses at least for the next twelve months as we complete the development of the etag technology  transfer the assays into the clinical laboratory  conduct clinical studies and develop the commercial infrastructure to support a commercial launch 
issuance of convertible senior unsecured notes in january  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior unsecured notes due the notes 
the aggregate purchase price for the notes is approximately million 
the notes do not bear interest and are convertible  at the option of the holder of such notes  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes 
the conversion price will adjust automatically upon certain changes to our capitalization 
although the notes are due in december  the notes may be called by the holders at their option at december   december  or december  at a price equal to of the accreted value 
following the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the estimated number of common shares underlying the notes  we will have the option to cause all or any portion of the notes to automatically convert at such time as the closing price of our common stock is greater than for twenty out of thirty consecutive trading days  subject to certain other limitations 
the notes are subordinated to all of our present senior debt  including the million senior secured convertible note due may  issued to pfizer in may  as amended as described below  and our line of credit with merrill lynch 
agreements with pfizer  inc 
in may  we entered into a non exclusive collaboration agreement the collaboration agreement with pfizer inc to facilitate the global availability for patient use of our proprietary trofile co receptor tropism assay trofile assay 
our trofile assay is used to identify which co receptor a patient s hiv uses for entry to cells and has been used in connection with phase iii clinical trials of pfizer s investigational ccr antagonist  maraviroc 
applications to the fda and emea the european union regulatory agency have been accepted for priority review by those agencies 
under the collaboration agreement we will have responsibility for making our trofile assay available in the us and pfizer will have responsibility for sales  marketing and regulatory matters outside of the us and will reimburse us for our expenses in establishing and maintaining the logistics infrastructure that may be necessary to make the assay available in those countries as required by pfizer 
the collaboration agreement covers the period through december  and is renewable by pfizer for five successive one year terms 
we and pfizer also extended the co receptor portion of our existing services agreement with pfizer for support of potential additional pfizer clinical trials through december  we also entered into a note purchase agreement with pfizer under which pfizer purchased a senior secured convertible note in the principal amount of million the pfizer note 
the pfizer note bears a annual interest rate  payable quarterly in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option  and matures in may unless converted earlier 
the pfizer note is convertible at pfizer s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and will automatically convert into shares of our common stock should the closing price of our common stock be greater than  or per share  of the conversion price for twenty out of thirty consecutive trading days 
in addition  the pfizer note is secured by certain assets related to our hiv 
table of contents testing business  is subject to certain covenants on our part and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness  subject to certain limited exceptions 
in connection with the sale of the notes  as described above  pfizer and us bank  national association  as trustee  and we entered into a subordination agreement in january  setting forth the terms under which the notes are subordinated to the pfizer note 
we also amended our note purchase agreement with pfizer  and amended and restated the pfizer note  to conform to certain terms of the subordination agreement 
as amended  the pfizer note provides that monogram will be in default if i an event of default occurs and is continuing under the notes and ii the trustee or any holders of the notes gives notice to us of its or their intent to either accelerate the notes or exercise any other remedies thereunder subject to certain limited exceptions 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting or as a single unit of accounting 
revenues are allocated to a delivered product or service when all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if all of the three required criteria under eitf are met  then the deliverables would be accounted for separately  completed as performed 
otherwise  the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when a performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
the pfizer collaboration is a multiple element arrangement  including supply of the trofile assay in additional clinical studies including expanded access programs in both the us and outside the us  supply of the trofile assay for clinical use outside of the us  reimbursement of costs for the establishment and operation of supply infrastructure outside of the us and potential assistance to pfizer in the establishment and operation of a second facility for processing of tropism assays 
under the guidelines of eitf  we have determined that the collaboration with pfizer should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting due to the absence of established fair values of certain undelivered elements 
accordingly  we have deferred revenue under this collaboration until the earlier of establishment of fair values or completion of the deliverables 
additionally  related direct costs that are contractually reimbursable on a non refundable basis under this collaboration have been deferred 
merger with aclara biosciences  inc 
on december   we completed our merger with aclara  a delaware corporation  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization dated may  as amended on october   or the merger agreement 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of aclara common stock was exchanged for shares of our common stock and contingent value rights  or cvrs 
we issued million shares of common stock valued at per share 
the fair value of our common stock utilized in determining the purchase price was derived using our average stock price for the period two days before through two days after the amended terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced on october  the cvrs were governed by a contingent value rights agreement and are described in more detail in this item under the heading contingent value rights 
the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and accordingly the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective fair values 
we engaged independent valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  particularly with regard to the valuation of intangible assets 

table of contents in connection with our merger with aclara  we have taken actions to integrate and restructure the former aclara operations 
we relocated the aclara personnel and operations from the facility in mountain view  california to our south san francisco  california facilities in the second quarter of a restructuring accrual was established for the costs of vacating and subleasing the mountain view facility including an estimate of the excess of our lease costs over our anticipated sublease income and for the anticipated severance costs for aclara employees whose employment was terminated as a result of the merger 
the accrual established at the closing of the merger related to the mountain view facility was million 
in addition  a restructuring accrual of million was established for the anticipated severance costs for aclara employees whose employment was terminated as a result of the merger 
additional restructuring accruals  due to delays in vacating and subleasing the mountain view facility  were recorded in the amounts of million and million in and  respectively 
in february  we executed a termination agreement with respect to the lease in exchange for a reduced but fixed payment commitment over the remainder of the previous lease term 
the initial charge of million to the estimates of completing the approved restructuring plans was recorded in goodwill and subsequent adjustments to these estimates have been recorded in our results of operations 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas r under provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using the modified prospective approach and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this approach  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas r  we record stock based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  we recognize stock based compensation cost only for those stock based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
we have no awards with market or performance conditions 

table of contents on november   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
there was no tax benefit realized upon exercise of stock options during the three months ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the statements of operations because the exercise price of the stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with sfas r and sab  we used the black scholes option pricing valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock based awards 
the determination of fair value for stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock over the expected term of the awards  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv actual and projected employee exercise behaviors referred to as the expected term 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities from our stock for the expected term in effect on the date of grant with considerations to similar public entities in similar markets 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury yield for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived from actual historical exercise data with considerations to the contractual and vesting terms 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plans is equal to the offering period 
in addition  sfas r requires us to estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate will be recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision 
if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from our estimates or factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates  as considered necessary 
in addition  we accounted for stock option grants to non employees in accordance with the emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the options subject to vesting to be periodically re valued over their service periods  which approximates the vesting period 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized upon completion of tests made on samples provided by customers and the shipment of test results to those customers 
services are provided to certain patients covered by various third party payor programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are included in revenue net of allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated receipts under such programs 
we estimate these allowances based on historical payment information and current sales data 
if the government and other third party payors significantly change their reimbursement policies  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary 
revenue generated from our database of resistance test results is recognized 
table of contents when earned under the terms of the related agreements  generally upon shipment of the requested reports 
contract revenue consists of revenue generated from nih grants  commercial assay development and other non product revenue 
nih grant revenue is recorded on a reimbursement basis as grant costs are incurred 
the costs associated with contract revenue are included in research and development expenses 
for commercial and research collaborations  we recognize non refundable milestone payments received related to substantive at risk milestones when performance of the milestone under the terms of the collaboration is achieved and there are no further performance obligations 
research and development fees from commercial collaboration agreements are generally recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the collaboration agreement or as the research work is performed 
up front payments received in advance of meeting the revenue recognition criteria described above are deferred 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting or as a single unit of accounting 
revenues are allocated to a delivered product or service when all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if all of the three required criteria under eitf are met  then the deliverables would be accounted for separately  completed as performed 
otherwise  the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
accounts receivable the process for estimating the collectibility of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
billings for services under third party payor programs are recorded as revenue net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts under such programs 
adjustments to the estimated receipts  based on final settlement with the third party payors  are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenue 
in addition  we review and estimate the collectibility of our receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we assess the current state of our billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on our reserve estimates  which involves judgment 
we believe that the collectibility of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes  most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide 
as such  we have implemented procedures to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information 
changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within general and administrative expenses 
we believe that our collection and reserves processes  along with our close monitoring of our billing processes  helps to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing operations 
we write off accounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our merger with aclara 
in accordance with statement of financial 
table of contents accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  we are required to test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets include acquired developed product technology  costs of patents and patent applications related to products and products in development  which are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition or loss of key personnel 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
due to our lack of earnings history  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
accounting for merger with aclara we accounted for the merger with aclara as a business combination which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we obtained assistance from independent valuation specialists 
the excess of the aggregate purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill 
contingent value rights as part of the merger with aclara biosciences  inc aclara  we issued contingent value rights cvr to aclara stockholders and were obligated to issue cvrs to holders of assumed aclara stock options upon future exercise of those options 
in june  the amount payable related to the outstanding cvrs was determined at per cvr and a cash payment of approximately million was made to cvr holders on june  holders of assumed aclara options are entitled to receive a cash payment of  upon future exercise of those options  for each cvr that would have been issuable to them had the option been exercised prior to the cvr maturity date 
the liability under the cvrs was recorded at the closing of the merger with aclara at fair value  estimated using a calculation based on a black scholes valuation of the underlying cvr securities of per cvr 
subsequent to the closing of the merger  an active trading market had been established and as a result  this liability was revalued based on the actual closing price of the cvrs on the otc bulletin board at the end of each quarter 
in addition  we record an additional liability each quarter for additional cvrs related to assumed aclara stock options as they vest during each quarter 
results of operations year ended december  compared to years ended december  and in thousands product revenue contract revenue total revenue 
table of contents revenue 
revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
product revenue comprises revenue from our hiv testing services 
the increase in product revenue of million in as compared to and million in as compared to was primarily due to the use of our testing services  including our trofile co receptor tropism assay  in phase iii clinical trials of pfizer s maraviroc  the first drug in a new class of hiv drugs called ccr antagonists 
this generated a significant source of revenue in and in the first half of the trial has now been completed  and applications for marketing approval have been accepted for priority review by the fda and emea the european union regulatory agency 
our trofile assay may be used for patient selection after regulatory approval of maraviroc 
however  if maraviroc is not approved by the fda  or if our test is not used for patient selection after approval  this could have a material negative impact on our revenues 
contract revenue consists of revenues from etag and oncology collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as nih research grants and other non product revenue 
these revenues increased in primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from etag and oncology collaborations 
in  these sources of revenue were reduced as we focused our oncology development efforts on enhancing the operational reproducibility and sensitivity of the etag assays and studies designed to clinically validate an etag test for applications in oncology 
we intend to make our first oncology test available to patients upon completion of transferring the etag assays from the research setting into our clia certified laboratory and after sufficient clinical data is generated 
we have an active program of applying for nih funding and currently have a number of active grants that we believe will help support the development of analytical and database tools to facilitate the identification and characterization of drug resistant strains of hiv  and assays that will aid in the pre clinical and clinical evaluation of the next generation of anti viral therapeutics 
we anticipate quarterly variations in revenue due primarily to fluctuations in the timing of various planned and ongoing clinical studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies 
we have significant customer concentration and the loss of any major customer or the reduced use of our products by a major customer could have a significant negative impact on our revenue 
in  and  approximately   and  respectively of our revenues were derived from tests performed for the beneficiaries of the medicare and medicaid programs 
additionally  in  and  pfizer inc represented approximately  and  quest diagnostics incorporated represented approximately  and and glaxosmithkline represented approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in these costs are materials  supplies  labor and overhead related to product revenue 
gross margins were in  in and in the decrease in gross margin percentage in as compared to was due to the reduction in pharmaceutical testing revenues in the second half of due to the completion of the phase iii trial of maraviroc 
the increase in gross margin percentage in as compared to was primarily due to the benefit of higher volumes provided by the growth in pharmaceutical testing revenue  especially revenue from pfizer  and the increased percentage of total revenue represented by these revenues 
additionally  stock based compensation expenses recognized primarily in accordance with sfas r in was million 
we anticipate that gross margin on product revenue will continue to be affected by these factors  and  in time  by the introduction of oncology products  which we believe may have a higher gross margin than our hiv products 
research and development 
research and development costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  research and development expenses was unchanged as compared to  although a net unfavorable change relating to stock based compensation expense of million was offset by lower materials and supplies costs in our oncology programs and reduced facilities expenses as a result of vacating the office and laboratory space in mountain view  california in the second quarter of the increase of million in as compared to was primarily due to costs incurred 
table of contents related to oncology and etag research and development programs  following the closing of the merger with aclara in december these costs were offset by a net favorable million adjustment from stock based compensation related to variable accounting for assumed aclara stock options with cvrs attached  cvr expenses related to vested options during the period and deferred compensation amortization 
in  we recorded million stock based compensation expenses primarily related to the recognition of option and employee stock purchase plan expenses in accordance with sfas r 
in  we recorded adjustments from stock based compensation related to variable accounting for the assumed aclara stock options with cvrs attached and cvr expenses related to vested options during the period 
these adjustments were favorable by million in we have expanded our business focus from infectious diseases to include both infectious diseases and oncology  and accordingly  our research and development expenditures have increased 
these expenses are in connection with the further development of the etag technology and preparations for the transfer of the etag assays from the research setting to our clia certified clinical laboratory and to generate clinical data in support of a commercial launch of etag assays 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
completion dates and research and development expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products  see the risk factors above 
our products in development for hiv and other infectious diseases target viral diseases and reflect a number of approaches to assessing resistance in individual patients to particular drugs 
our product lines overlap and most of our research and development activities in infectious disease are advancing multiple potential product lines 
due to this substantial overlap  we do not track costs on a project by project basis  except for the costs related to contract revenue 
a portion of our infectious disease research and development expenses are funded by grants and commercial contracts and the following table sets our costs that are included in research and development expenses that are associated with such revenues year ended december  in thousands nih grants below is a summary of our products in development for hiv and other infectious diseases 
infectious disease products in development status replication capacity hiv  a measurement of fitness in development phenosense hiv entry  entry inhibitor assay in development geneseq hiv entry  entry inhibitor assay in development phenosense and geneseq hiv integrase  integrase inhibitor assays in development phenosense hiv antibody neutralization  a vaccine development and evaluation assay in development phenosense and geneseq hiv assembly maturation  virus assembly or maturation inhibitor assays 
in development phenosense hcv  a phenotypic hepatitis c inhibitor assay in development geneseq hcv  a genotypic hepatitis c inhibitor assay in development the replication capacity hiv assay is validated in our clinical laboratory and the data is currently reported on our phenosense hiv and phenosense gt tests to both pharmaceutical company customers and for patient testing 
clinical development work continues 
the phenosense hiv entry assay has been validated in our clinical laboratory for enfuvirtide fuzeon testing and is available to pharmaceutical company customers and for patient testing 
the assay is also 
table of contents available to pharmaceutical company customers for testing of other new entry inhibitors in development  but is not yet validated in the clinical laboratory for such use for other drugs for patent testing 
the geneseq hiv entry assay is in development 
additional development work is being conducted on this assay 
the phenosense and geneseq hiv integrase assays are validated for research purpose and available to pharmaceutical company customers 
assays for the integrase class are being validated and are expected to be available for physician use as needed after the first integrase drug is approved by the fda 
the phenosense hiv antibody neutralization assay is validated for research purposes and available to pharmaceutical company customers 
with nih funding  additional development work related to the use of our assays in vaccine development is being conducted 
the phenosense and geneseq hiv assembly maturation inhibitor assays are in development 
additional development work is being conducted on these assays 
the geneseq hcv nsb assay has been validated for research use and is available to pharmaceutical company customers 
the geneseq hcv ns and phenosense hcv assays are in development pending the evolution of clinical or drug development need for such testing 
a portion of our research and development expenditures are now directed at continuing the research and development of the etag system 
our etag technology has potential application as a research tool in drug discovery and development in gene expression profiling and protein expression analysis 
these applications have been considered as developed product technology in the allocation of the purchase consideration for aclara 
in addition  our etag technology has the potential  through detection of unique protein based biomarkers  to differentiate likely responders from non responders to certain targeted therapies in certain patient groups 
assays based on this technology have the potential to be used as aides for patient selection in pharmaceutical companies clinical trials of therapeutic products targeted on specific patient populations and as diagnostic services and or kits to guide physicians in the selection of appropriate therapies for particular patients 
products in development are as follows oncology products in development status clinical assays for use in drug discovery  development and clinical evaluation by pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in development clinical assays for diagnostic use in patient testing in development completion of clinical assays for use in clinical trials by pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers is dependent on additional research and development and clinical studies in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
such research and development and clinical studies are expected to be time consuming  and could exceed one year 
completion of clinical assays for diagnostic use in patient testing is dependent on the successful completion of additional research and development and clinical studies both in collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and in multiple and broader clinical studies that provide data that will enable physicians to utilize the tests 
completion of patient testing assays will also require the development and validation of an assay in a clia clinical laboratory certified format 
successful completion of such research and development and clinical studies is expected to be time consuming  and could exceed one year 
as with our infectious disease programs  many of our oncology research and development programs support multiple product areas 
in particular  there is substantial overlap between our research and development activities in support of protein expression assays and protein based clinical assays for clinical collaborations and patient testing 
because of this overlap we do not identify and track costs incurred on a project by project basis 
the completion of our research and development projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including unplanned delays or expenditures during our product development  the extent of clinical testing required for regulatory approvals  the timing and results of clinical trials  failure to validate our technology and products in clinical trials and failure to receive any necessary regulatory approvals 
because of these uncertainties  the 
table of contents nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete our research and development projects cannot be determined or estimated with any degree of certainty 
any delays or additional research and development efforts may also require us to obtain additional sources of funding to complete development of our products 
our failure to complete development of our products would have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase revenue and on our financial position and liquidity 
purchased in process research and development 
we recorded a million charge for in process research and development in for the portion of the purchase consideration of the aclara merger allocated to in process research and development 
this non recurring charge reflects the fair value of projects to develop etag assays that can be commercialized as aides to patient selection in pharmaceutical company clinical trials and as diagnostic tests to assist physicians in determining the appropriate therapy for individual cancer patients that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
we engaged independent valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of these in process research and development projects as well as developed product technology 
the fair value is determined using the income approach 
this method starts with a forecast of anticipated future net cash flows  which are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of million 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to business development activities for oncology and increased marketing programs related to our products

these adjustments were favorable by million in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase due to increased sales and marketing activities related to commercial introduction of our trofile co receptor tropism assay in anticipation of  and after  fda approval of pfizer s maraviroc 
in addition  after we achieve clinical validation of our etag assays  we expect our sales and marketing expenses  for promotional programs as well as sales and marketing personnel  will increase in preparation for the introduction of oncology products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to an increase of million in stock based compensation expense and to increases in professional services fees

lease termination charge 
in march  we terminated a lease for our original laboratory and office space of approximately  square feet in south san francisco  california 
under the terms of the lease termination  we recorded a charge of million primarily related to the termination payment and the write off of the net carrying value of the related leasehold improvements 
this early termination enabled us to eliminate operating expenses related to this lease going forward and reduce our aggregate remaining obligation by approximately half 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease of million in as compared to was a result of lower average cash balances

contingent value rights revaluation 
our liability under the cvrs  issued to aclara stockholders as part of the purchase consideration in the merger with aclara  was recorded at the closing of our merger with aclara at fair value  estimated using a calculation based on a black scholes valuation of the underlying cvr securities of per cvr 
because subsequent to the closing of the merger  an active trading market had been established  this liability was revalued based on the actual closing price of the cvrs on the otc bulletin board 
table of contents at the end of each quarter 
in june  the amount payable related to the outstanding cvrs was determined at per cvr and a cash payment of approximately million was made to cvr holders on june  this revaluation led to a million unfavorable adjustment to the liability and is reflected as a non operating expense in the statement of operations for the year ended preferred stock dividend 
we recorded a preferred stock dividend of million and million in and  respectively 
the series a preferred stock issued in bore dividends payable twice a year in shares of common stock 
in june  all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were converted to common stock 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   funds provided by the sale of our products  contract revenue  borrowing under accounts receivable and equipment financing arrangements and net proceeds  received in january  of million from the sale of our convertible senior unsecured notes will be adequate to fund our operations at least for the next twelve months 
see note subsequent events to the financial statements for further discussion 
we have funded our operations since inception primarily through public and private sales of common and preferred stock  issuance of convertible debt  equipment financing arrangements  product revenue  contract revenue  and a revolving line of credit 
in particular  we have completed three private financings since our initial public offering in may in addition  during as the result of the merger with aclara  we acquired million in cash and short term investments

the note is due in and interest on these borrowings is payable in cash or stock  at our option 
in september  we entered into a credit and security agreement with merrill for a million revolving credit line  under which borrowings are limited by eligible accounts receivable 
in january  we sold a convertible senior unsecured note to an investor 
the principal amount of the note is million and reflecting the zero coupon nature of the note  it was sold for an aggregate price of million 
after fees and expenses  net proceeds to us were approximately million 
the note may be called by the investor at december   december  or december   at a price equal to of the accreted value 
although we expect our operating and capital resources will be sufficient to meet future requirements for at least the next twelve months  we may have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our etag technology and to support our business operations in general 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or may not be available at all 
if adequate funds are not available on commercially reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or sell significant assets and may not be able to continue as a going concern 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for current or future operating plans 
in connection with the merger with aclara  we issued cvrs to aclara stockholders and were obligated to issue cvrs to holders of assumed aclara stock options upon future exercise of those options 
in june  the amount payable related to the outstanding cvrs was determined to be per cvr and a cash payment of approximately million was made to cvr holders on june  holders of assumed aclara options are entitled to receive a cash payment of  upon future exercise of those options  for each cvr that would have been issuable to them had the option been exercised prior to the cvr maturity date 
at december   assumed aclara options to purchase million shares of our common stock were outstanding  of which million shares were vested 
the aggregate potential liability related to all these options at december  was million 
of this  million is reflected on the balance sheet at december  in respect of options vested and the remainder will be recognized as the options vest in the future 
upon exercise of these options  we will receive aggregate exercise proceeds of million  offsetting the potential cvr payments of million

cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly due to various factors including trends in operating losses  changes in accounts receivable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue related to new arrangements with customers 
the average collection period of our accounts receivable as measured in days sales outstanding can vary and is dependent on various factors  including the type of revenue ie patient testing  pharmaceutical company testing or contract revenue  the payment terms related to that revenue  the complexities in third party payer arrangements  and whether the related revenue was recorded at the beginning or end of a period

leases 
at december   we leased a building of approximately  square feet in south san francisco  california  comprising laboratory and office space 
the lease expires in april and provides an option to extend the term for an additional ten years 
we also subleased approximately  square feet in another adjacent building in south san francisco  california  comprising laboratory and office space 
this sublease expires in december in february  we entered into a twelve month lease on approximately  square feet of office space in south san francisco 
in addition  as a result of our merger with aclara  we assumed the lease for a building of approximately  square feet in mountain view  california comprising laboratory and office space 
on february   we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease prior to its scheduled expiry 
see subsequent events note to the financial statements for further discussion 
in august  we entered into a loan agreement of million to finance our insurance premiums at an interest rate of per annum 
the loan was paid in full in january in march  we terminated a lease for our laboratory and office space of approximately  square feet in south san francisco  california 
under the terms of the lease termination agreement  we paid and recorded a charge of million primarily related to the termination payment and the write off of the net carrying value of the related leasehold improvements 

table of contents contractual obligations 
at december   our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands operating lease obligations equipment financing arrangements convertible promissory note convertible promissory note interest payment loans payable purchase obligations total subject to certain limitations  we are entitled to make such interest payments using shares of our common stock 
the contractual obligations discussed above are fixed costs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet these contractual obligations  we may have to raise additional funds 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in june  we assigned a lease of excess laboratory and office space and sold the related leasehold improvements and equipment to a third party 
in the event of default by the assignee  we would be contractually obligated for payments under the lease of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in long term capital and liquidity considerations 
we expect that we will have to make substantial investments in operating and capital expenditures as we develop and commercialize new clinical testing products and expand the availability of our current testing products 
during  we made capital expenditures of approximately million 
while we do not currently have any additional material commitments for future capital expenditures  we expect that we will have additional requirements for facilities and capital expenditures as we expand our clinical laboratory to accommodate commercial availability of etag assays for oncology  expand our commercial infrastructure in anticipation of the introduction of oncology products  potentially establish an fda compliant manufacturing facility and make our hiv and oncology assays available globally in support of drugs for which our tests may be important diagnostics 
we have signed a short term lease for additional facilities to accommodate anticipated increased administrative and marketing activities in in addition  our sublease on a building in south san francisco of approximately  square feet expires at the end of and we are evaluating alternatives for the availability of facilities in south san francisco is severely limited and there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable space at a commercially reasonable cost 
in addition  alternative facilities may not be in close proximity to our existing facilities and this could cause disruption and inefficiencies in our operations 
due to increased market lease rates  the potential cost of moving to a new facility and the cost of leasehold improvements and equipment in an alternative facility  our capital and operating costs could increase substantially in connection with our leasing of additional or replacement facilities 
from time to time  we may consider possible strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  with the goal of further developing our business and maximizing stockholder value 
such transactions  if any  could materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources 
we 
table of contents may need to obtain additional funding by entering into new collaborations and strategic partnerships to enable us to develop and commercialize our products 
even if we receive funding from future collaborations and strategic partnerships  we may need to raise additional capital in the public equity markets  through private equity financing or through debt financing 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates between the years and if not utilized 
the state of california net operating losses will expire at various dates between the years and  if not utilized 
the federal and state operating loss carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
utilization of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
when utilized  the portion related to stock options deductions will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principle if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps 
fair values represent the market principal at december  in thousands 
given an interest rate decrease of x basis points given an interest rate increase of x basis points issuer bps bps bps bps bps bps bps money market bonds of us government and its agencies the weighted average maturity of our marketable investments at december  was days 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit line with merrill lynch capital  which bears interest at a rate per annum equal to a published libor rate plus 
as of december  approximately million was outstanding under the revolving credit line 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
