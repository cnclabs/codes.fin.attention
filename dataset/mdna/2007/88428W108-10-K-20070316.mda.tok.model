item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
overview third wave technologies  inc is a leading molecular diagnostics company 
we believe our proprietary invader chemistry  a novel  molecular chemistry  is easier to use and more accurate than competing technologies 
these and other advantages conferred by our chemistry are enabling us to provide clinicians and researchers with superior molecular solutions 
more than clinical laboratory customers are using third wave s molecular diagnostic reagents 
other customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and major health care providers 
in august  we received clearance from the us food and drug administration the fda for our invader ugta molecular assay 
the invader ugta molecular assay is cleared for use to identify patients who may be at increased risk of adverse reaction to the chemotherapy drug camptosar irinotecan by detecting and identifying specific mutations in the ugta gene that have been associated with that risk 
camptosar  marketed in the us by pfizer  inc  is used to treat colorectal cancer and was relabeled recently to include dosing recommendations based on a patient s genetic profile 
we also market a growing number of products  including analyte specific reagents asrs 
these asrs allow certified clinical reference laboratories to create assays to perform hepatitis c virus genotyping  inherited disorders testing eg  factor v leiden  and a host of other mutations associated with genetic predispositions and other diseases 
we have developed or plan to develop a menu of molecular diagnostic products for clinical applications that include genetic testing  pharmacogenetics  and women s health 
we also have a number of other invader products including those for research  agricultural and other applications 
the fda is considering new guidelines for the use of asrs 
the enactment of new guidelines or potential adverse market perceptions of using asrs when fda cleared tests are available may present risks to our ability to continue to successfully market and sell our asr products 
currently  one of our key strategic initiatives is the commercialization of our human papillomavirus hpv offering 
in august  we began clinical trials for two hpv premarket approval submissions to the fda 
we expect to spend between million and million on these submissions over three years 
if for any reason these trials are not successful or are substantially delayed or for any other reason we are unable to successfully commercialize our hpv offering  our business and prospects would likely be materially adversely impacted 
additionally  we anticipate significant competition in the hpv market as additional large competitors have announced plans to enter the market in the near future 
this competition may have a significant impact on the success of our commercialization of our hpv offering 
in january  digene corporation initiated legal proceedings against us over our hpv products 
see part  item legal proceedings 
should the outcome of this action be unfavorable  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in the demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and deliveries made during the quarter  the timing of research  development and grant revenues  and increases in spending  including expenses related to our product development submissions for fda clearances or approvals and intellectual property litigation 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery which is generally when the title passes to the customer  provided that the company has completed all performance obligations and the customer has accepted the products 
customers have no contractual rights of return or refunds associated with product sales 
consideration received in multiple element arrangements is allocated to the separate units based upon their relative fair values 
the multiple element arrangements involve contracts with customers in which the company is selling reagent products and leasing equipment to the customer for use during the term of the contract 
based upon the guidance in paragraph of emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  both the reagents and equipment have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for both the reagents and equipment and there are no rights of return 
the company has sold both the reagents and equipment separately  and therefore is able to determine a fair value for each 
the respective fair values are used to allocate the proceeds received to each of the elements for purposes of recognizing revenue 
grant and development revenues consist primarily of research grants from agencies of the federal government and revenue from companies with which the company has established strategic alliances  the revenue from which is recognized as research is performed 
payments received which are related to future performance are deferred and recorded as revenue when earned 
grant payments designated to purchase specific assets to be used in the performance of a contract are recognized as revenue over the shorter of the useful life of the asset acquired or the contract 
license and royalty revenue includes amounts earned from third parties for licenses of the company s intellectual property and are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
license revenues are generally recognized upon receipt unless the company has continuing performance obligations  in which case the license revenue is recognized ratably over the period of expected performance 
restructuring and other charges the restructuring and other charges resulting from the restructuring plan in the third quarter of was recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the restructuring charge was comprised primarily of costs to consolidate facilities  impairment charges for abandoned leasehold improvements and equipment to be sold or abandoned  prepayment penalties related mainly to capital lease obligations on equipment to be sold or abandoned  and other costs related to the restructuring 
in calculating the cost to consolidate the facilities  we estimated the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the leases are terminated and the amount  if any  of sublease receipts for each location 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
estimates were also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that was held for sale 
these estimates were formed 
table of contents based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  and the offsetting sublease receipts may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
long lived assets impairment equipment  leasehold improvements and amortizable identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets 
for assets removed from service and held for sale  we estimate the fair market value of such assets and record an adjustment if fair value less costs to sell is lower than carrying value 
there was no impairment in an impairment loss of  and  was recorded in and  respectively  related to the write down of certain equipment to its fair value 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we completed annual impairment tests in the quarters ended september    and and concluded that no impairment existed 
derivative instruments we sell products in a number of countries throughout the world 
during  and  we sold certain products with the resulting accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
prior to  we purchased foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with collections of receivables denominated in foreign currencies in the normal course of business 
these derivative instruments had maturities of less than one year and were intended to offset the effect of transaction gains and losses 
we had no derivatives contracts outstanding at december  or december  inventories slow moving and obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because of process improvements or technology advancements  the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or estimates of shelf lives change 
we currently consider all inventory that we expect will have no activity within one year or within the period defined by the expiration date of the product  as well as any additional specifically identified inventory including inventory that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as changing manufacturing processes and technologies to be excess inventory 
at december  and  our inventory reserves were  or of our million total gross inventories  and  or of our million total gross inventories  respectively 
stock based compensation expense prior to  we accounted for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options when granted 
on january  we adopted sfas no 
r share based payments as a result of which we recognize expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units  based on their fair values 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r 
in october  our audit committee concluded a voluntary investigation of the company s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting 
this investigation  which was conducted with the assistance of outside legal counsel  covered the timing  pricing and authorization of all our stock option grants made since our initial public offering in february based on this review  we determined that we used incorrect measurement dates with respect to the accounting for certain previously granted stock options  primarily during the years through the audit committee concluded that deficiencies in the grant process were the result of administrative 
table of contents errors and misunderstanding of applicable accounting rules  and were not attributable to fraud or intentional misconduct 
we recorded an additional stock based compensation charge totaling  in the quarter ended september   representing the effect of the adjustment resulting from the charges discussed above that relate to additionally  we recorded a reclassification between accumulated deficit and additional paid in capital  within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet as of december   of approximately  this reclassification represents the effect of the adjustment resulting from the charges discussed above that related to fiscal and prior years 
there were no significant income tax effects relating to this adjustment for the company
