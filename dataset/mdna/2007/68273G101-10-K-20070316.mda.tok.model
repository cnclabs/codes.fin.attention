this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide outsourced  web based financial technology services branded to over  financial institution  biller  card issuer and creditor clients 
with four business lines in two primary vertical markets  we serve over million billable consumer and business end users 
end users may access and view their accounts online and perform various web based self service functions 
they may also make electronic bill payments and funds transfers  utilizing our unique  real time debit architecture  ach and other payment methods 
our value added relationship management services reinforce a favorable user experience and drive a profitable and competitive internet channel for our clients 
further  we have professional services  including software solutions  which enable various deployment options  a broad range of customization and other value added services 
we currently operate in two business segments banking and ecommerce 
registered end users using account presentation  bill payment or both  and the payment transactions executed by those end users are the major drivers of our revenues 
since december   the number of users using our account presentation services increased  and the number of users using our payment services increased  for an overall increase in users 
for the year ended december   the number of payment transactions completed by banking and biller end users increased by 
the large increase in payment services users and payment transactions in is the result of the princeton acquisition  which occurred on july  this acquisition brought us approximately million additional payment services users in the banking segment  million additional users in the ecommerce segment and million additional payment transactions per month 
exclusive of the users and payment transactions brought to us by the princeton acquisition  users increased by and payment transactions increased by 

table of contents increase period ended december  decrease change account presentation users s banking segment ecommerce segment enterprise payment services users s banking segment ecommerce segment   n a enterprise total users s banking segment ecommerce segment enterprise payment services transactions s banking segment ecommerce segment   n a enterprise we have long term service contracts with most of our financial services provider clients 
the majority of our revenues are recurring  though these contracts also provide for implementation  set up and other non recurring fees 
account presentation services revenues are based on either a monthly license fee  allowing our financial institution clients to register an unlimited number of customers  or a monthly fee for each registered customer 
payment services revenues are either based on a monthly fee for each customer enrolled  a fee per executed transaction  or a combination of both 
our clients pay nearly all of our fees and then determine if or how they want to pass these costs on to their users 
they typically provide account presentation services to users free of charge  as they derive significant potential benefits including account retention  delivery and paper cost savings  account consolidation and cross selling of other products 
as a network based service provider  we have made substantial up front investments in infrastructure  particularly for our proprietary systems 
while we continue to incur ongoing development and maintenance costs  we believe the infrastructure we have built provides us with significant operating leverage 
we continue to automate processes and develop applications that allow us to make only small increases in labor and other operating costs relative to increases in customers and transactions 
we believe our financial and operating performance will be based primarily on our ability to leverage additional end users and transactions over this relatively fixed cost base 
critical accounting policies and estimates the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our annual audited consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition policy 
we generate revenues from service fees  professional services  and other supporting services as a financial technology services provider in the banking and ecommerce markets 
service fee revenues are generally comprised of account presentation services  payment services and relationship management services 
many of our contracts contain monthly user fees  transaction fees and new user registration fees for the account presentation services  payment services and relationship management services we offer that are often subject to monthly minimums  all of which are classified as service fees in our statements of operations 
additionally  some contracts contain fees for relationship management marketing programs which are also classified as service fees in our statements of operations 
these services are not 
table of contents considered separate deliverables pursuant to emerging issues task force issues eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

accordingly  the new user registration fees are deferred and recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over the period from the date that new user registration work concludes through the end of the contract 
fees for relationship management marketing programs  monthly user and transaction fees  including the monthly minimums  are recognized in the month in which the services are provided or  in the case of minimums  in the month to which the minimum applies 
we recognize revenues from service fees in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 which requires that revenues generally are realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues associated with services that are subject to refund are not recognized until such time as the exposure to potential refund has lapsed 
we collect funds from end users and aggregate them in clearing accounts  which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets  as we do not have ownership of these funds 
for certain transactions  funds may remain in the clearing accounts until a payment check is deposited or other payment transmission is accepted by the receiving merchant 
we earn interest on these funds for the period they remain in the clearing accounts 
the collection of interest on these clearing accounts is considered in our determination of our fee structure for clients and represents a portion of the payment for services performed by us 
the interest totaled  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively and is classified as service fees in our consolidated statements of operations 
professional services revenues consist of implementation fees associated with the linking of our financial institution clients to our service platforms through various networks  along with web development and hosting fees  training fees  communication services and sales of software licenses and related support 
when we provide access to our service platforms to the customer using a hosting model  revenues are recognized in accordance with sab no 
the implementation and web hosting services are not considered separate deliverables pursuant to eitf no 
accordingly  implementation fees and related direct implementation costs are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term  which is typically three years 
revenues from web development  web hosting  training and communications services are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
when we provide services to the customer through the delivery of software  revenues from the sale of software licenses  services and related support are recognized according to statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop no 

in accordance with the provisions of sop no 
 revenues from sales of software licenses are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the software has been delivered  provided that no significant obligations remain under the contract 
we have multiple element software arrangements  which in addition to the delivery of software  typically also include support services 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenues using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements  based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  is deferred 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenues related to the delivered elements 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the amounts charged when those elements are sold separately 
for sales of software that require significant production  modification or customization  pursuant to sop no 
 we apply the provisions of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts arb no 
 and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop no 
 and recognize revenues related to software license fees and related services using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion is measured based on the percentage of labor effort incurred to date to estimated total labor effort to complete delivery of the software license 
changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they are determined 
we record any estimated 
table of contents losses on contracts immediately upon determination 
revenues related to support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support agreement 
other revenues consist of service fees related to enhanced third party solutions and termination fees 
service fees for enhanced third party solutions include fully integrated bill payment and account retrieval services through intuit s quicken  check ordering  inter institution funds transfer  account aggregation and check imaging 
revenues from these service fees are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
termination fees are recognized upon termination of a contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the provision for losses on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts are recognized based on our estimate  which considers our historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data and financial health of specific customers 
during the year ended december   we wrote off  of accounts receivable against the allowance for doubtful accounts and reduced the allowance by an additional  based on judgment related to projected data to reflect a balance of  at year end 
this represents management s estimate of the probable losses in the accounts receivable balance at december  while the allowance for doubtful accounts and the provision for losses on accounts receivable depend to a large degree on future conditions  management can not forecast significant adverse developments in income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
prior to december   we maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset resulting primarily from our net operating loss carryforwards  since the likelihood of the realization of that asset had not become more likely than not as of those balance sheet dates 
at december   we determined that our recent experience generating taxable income balanced against our history of losses  along with our projection of future taxable income  constituted significant positive evidence for partial realization of the deferred tax asset and  therefore  partial release of the valuation allowance against that asset 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we released valuation allowance against million of our total million net operating loss carryforwards at december   creating a million deferred tax asset as of december  and a million benefit to our earnings for the year ended december  at one or more future dates  if sufficient positive evidence exists that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized with respect to the remaining net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax asset  we will release the remaining valuation allowance  realize the remaining deferred tax asset and report the associated benefit to our earnings in the appropriate period 
cost of internal use software and computer software to be sold 
we capitalize the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop no 

capitalized computer software costs consist primarily of payroll related and consulting costs incurred during the development stage 
we expense costs related to preliminary project assessments  research and development  re engineering  training and application maintenance as they are incurred 
capitalized software costs are being depreciated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of three years upon being placed in service 
we capitalize the cost of computer software to be sold according to sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas no 

software development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established by completion of a working model of the product and ending when a product is ready for general release to customers 

table of contents impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

under these provisions  we assess the recoverability of these types of assets at least annually and when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we use the fair value method to assess the recoverability of our goodwill within our two reporting units  banking and ecommerce 
we use the undiscounted cash flows method  when needed  to assess the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets and the discounted cash flows method  at least annually  to assess the recoverability of our goodwill 
we did not incur any impairment charges for the years ended december   or future impairment assessments could result in impairment charges that would reduce the carrying values of these assets 
escalation accrual 
the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock has a feature that grants holders the right to receive interest like returns on accrued  but unpaid dividends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 we bifurcated the fair market value of this feature as an embedded derivative which is classified as a liability 
this liability for the fair value of the embedded derivative will be adjusted to mark its fair value to market at the end of each reporting period by adjusting interest expense and therefore  current income 
there is no active quoted market available for the fair value of the embedded derivative 
thus  management has to make substantial estimates about the future cash flows related to the liability  the estimated period which the series a preferred stock will be outstanding and the appropriate discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments  a company must designate the hedging instrument  based upon the exposure being hedged  as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into operations in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings for example  in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is recognized in other income expense in current operations during the period of change 
alternatively  if meeting the criteria of derivative implementation group statement implementation issue no 
g  a cash flow hedge is considered perfectly effective and the entire gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into operations in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
derivatives are reported on the balance sheet in other current and long term assets or other current and long term liabilities based upon when the financial instrument is expected to mature 
accordingly  derivatives are included in the changes in other assets and liabilities in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows 
alternatively  in accordance with sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  derivatives containing a financing element are reported as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our equity compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for and  as all 
table of contents options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in this model are expected dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
the expected volatility for stock options to purchase the company s common stock is based on implied volatility from the historical volatility of its common stock 
staff accounting bulletin no 
in september  the sec staff issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
requires that public companies utilize a dual approach method to assess the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment rollover method and a balance sheet focused assessment iron curtain method 
the guidance in sab no 
must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  under the provisions of sab no 
we reevaluated our recognition of certain user set up fees charged to clients to establish online banking capabilities to individual customers 
we determined that these fees should be recognized as revenue over the remaining life of client contracts rather than at the time of set up as had been done in prior years 
while the impact on prior year financial statements was not considered material using the rollover method  the error was considered material using the iron curtain method 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sab  the cumulative effect of the error was recorded as an adjustment of accumulated deficit as of january  the resulting cumulative effect adjustment was a million increase to deferred revenue and corresponding increase to the accumulated deficit 
recently issued pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of january   as required 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings 
we have not yet determined if the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued  sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under the standard  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
also  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy which gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
the company has no plans to adopt the statement early and will adopt by january   as required 
the company has not determined

account presentation services 
both the banking and ecommerce segments contribute to account presentation services revenues  which decreased million to million 
the loss of three of our largest clients  who were acquired by other financial institutions and subsequently migrated off our platform in the first half of  is the primary reason for the decrease  with account presentation services revenue generated by the remaining client base increasing by compared to none of this growth was due to the acquisition of princeton 
the low rate of growth is the result of our decision to fix price the account presentation service to our clients  especially our banking clients  in an effort to drive adoption of those services 
this allows our financial services provider clients to register an unlimited number of account presentation services users as evidenced by the increase in banking account presentation services adoption since december  to whom we can then attempt to up sell our higher margin bill pay products and other services 
payment services 
primarily composed of revenues from the banking segment prior to the acquisition of princeton  payment services revenue is now driven by both the banking and ecommerce segments 
payment services revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
while approximately of the increase was related to the addition of new revenues from princeton  the remaining was driven by growth in our existing business in the form of a increase in the number of period end payment services users and a increase in the number of payment transactions processed during the period 
the increases in period end payment services users and the number of payment transactions processed by our existing business resulted from two factors an increase in financial services provider clients using our payment services and an increase in payment services adoption by our payment services clients end users 
compared to december   the number of financial services provider clients using our payment services increased from to additionally  we increased the adoption rate of our payment services from at december  to at december  relationship management services 
primarily composed of revenues from the banking segment  relationship management services revenues increased slightly by million 
this was the result of a increase in the number of period end banking segment end users utilizing either account presentation or payment services compared to  exclusive of acquired princeton users since they do not currently contribute to relationship management services revenues

the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
