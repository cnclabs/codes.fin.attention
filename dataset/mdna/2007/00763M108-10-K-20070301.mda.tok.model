overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices for the eye 
effective january   our reportable segments are represented by our three business units cataract implant  laser vision correction lvc and eye care 
previously  our reportable segments were based on geographic regions which comprised the americas  which included north and south america  europe africa middle east  japan and asia pacific  which excluded japan and included new zealand and australia 
sales and operating results for and have been conformed to reflect the change in presentation of reportable segments 
our cataract implant business focuses on the four key products required for cataract surgery foldable intraocular lenses  or iols  implantation systems  phacoemulsification systems and viscoelastics 
our lvc business markets laser systems  diagnostic devices  treatment cards and microkeratomes for use in laser eye surgery 
our eye care business provides a full range of contact lens care products for use with most types of contact lenses 
these products include single bottle  multi purpose cleaning and disinfecting solutions  hydrogen peroxide based disinfecting solutions  daily cleaners  enzymatic cleaners and contact lens rewetting drops 
we have operations in approximately countries and sell our products in approximately countries in the following four regions americas north and south america  europe  africa and middle east  japan  and asia pacific excluding japan  but including australia and new zealand 
eye care recall in november  we announced the anticipated financial impact associated with the voluntary recall of certain eye care product lots and the related manufacturing capacity constraints caused by a production line issue at our manufacturing plant in china 
the recall negatively impacted sales in the fourth quarter of due to sales returns of million 
we also estimated approximately million in lost sales in as a result of the recall 
the total of million was slightly higher than our original estimate due to higher returns 
we incurred approximately million in recall related costs  of which approximately million was recorded in cost of goods sold and million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  we expect to lose approximately million to million in sales and incur about million to million in costs 
the costs are due to start up related expenses and unabsorbed overhead as production ramps up in the first and second quarters of and to spending on marketing programs to re launch products and recapture market share 
we commenced the voluntary recall as a result of a production line issue at our manufacturing plant in china  which could affect the sterility of the product 
this issue was limited to two of the four production lines in the china facility 
in all  we recalled million units  most from asia pacific  with about  units retrieved from japan and the us in addition  we destroyed about million units that were still in our control 
to correct the sterility issue  we temporarily closed the china plant to conduct a special cleaning and sanitization  and complete an already planned expansion 
we began production on two of the plant s four lines in january and expect the third also to be operational in the first quarter of we have commenced product shipments to japan distribution centers  and are scheduled to begin shipping to the asia pacific markets before the end of the first quarter of the remaining line has been completely replaced and is being expanded to provide automated packaging capabilities that are expected to provide greater flexibility 
as per our original schedule  the fourth line is expected to be operational in the late may early june timeframe 
our spain facility supplies the americas and european markets so there have been no supply disruptions to these regions as a result of the recall 
product rationalization and repositioning plan on october   our board of directors approved a product rationalization and repositioning plan covering the discontinuation of non strategic cataract surgical and eye care products and the elimination or redeployment of resources that support these product lines 
the plan also included organizational changes and potential reductions in force in manufacturing  sales and marketing associated with these product lines  as well as organizational changes in research and development and other corporate functions designed to align the organization with our strategy and strategic business unit organization 
the plan further called for increasing our investment in key growth opportunities  specifically our refractive implant product line and international laser vision correction business  and accelerating the implementation of productivity initiatives 
in  we incurred million of pre tax charges  which included million for inventory  manufacturing related and other charges included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses for severance  relocation and other one time termination benefits of million  productivity and brand repositioning costs of million  offset by net asset disposal gains of million and a net credit from settlement of contractual obligations of million 
in  we incurred million in pre tax charges which included million for inventory related charges included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses for severance  relocation and other one time termination benefits of million  asset write downs of million  contractual obligations of million and accelerated productivity and brand repositioning costs of million 
we do not expect to incur additional charges associated with this plan 
the cumulative charges incurred of million were within the range previously announced 
pending acquisition of intralase corp 
on january   we entered into an agreement with intralase corp 
intralase to acquire intralase for approximately million in cash 
intralase manufactures femtosecond laser systems utilized in lasik surgery 
under terms of the agreement  approved by the boards of directors of both companies  after they received fairness opinions from their respective financial advisors  we will pay in cash per share of intralase stock and the individually determined cash value per share of outstanding stock options 
we have arranged committed financing from a consortium of banks to complete the transaction 
we expect the transaction to be completed early in the second quarter of the transaction is subject to intralase stockholder approval as well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
for a description of the risks related to this transaction  see risks relating to the pending intralase corp 
acquisition beginning on page acquisition of visx  incorporated on may   pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger merger agreement  dated as of november   as amended  by and among advanced medical optics  inc amo  vault merger corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of amo  and visx  incorporated visx  we completed our acquisition of visx  for total consideration of approximately billion  consisting of approximately million shares of amo common stock  the fair value of visx stock options converted to amo stock options and approximately million in cash visx acquisition 
visx products include the visx star excimer laser system  the visx wavescan system and visx treatment cards 
the visx acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our reported financial position and results of operations after may  include visx and the impact of purchase accounting 
purchase accounting applied to the visx acquisition resulted in a non cash in process research and development charge of million in the year ended december  acquisition of pfizer inc surgical ophthalmic business on june   we completed the acquisition of the pfizer inc surgical ophthalmic business for million in cash pfizer acquisition 
we acquired ophthalmic surgical products and certain manufacturing and research and development facilities located in uppsala  sweden  groningen  netherlands and bangalore  india 
the products acquired include the healon line of viscoelastic products used in ocular surgery  the tecnis intraocular lenses and the baerveldt glaucoma shunt 
the pfizer acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
our reported financial position and results of operations after june  include pfizer and the impact of purchase accounting 
purchase accounting applied to the pfizer acquisition resulted in charges in the year ended december   including an in process research and development charge of million and incremental cost of sales of million from the sale of acquired inventory adjusted to fair value 
during  we also incurred other acquisition related charges totaling approximately million as we integrated the pfizer surgical ophthalmic business and eliminated duplicative functions 
separation from allergan allergan spun off its existing optical medical device business by contributing all of the assets related to the two business lines that comprise the optical medical device business to us and distributing all of our outstanding shares of common stock to its stockholders 
we had no material assets  liabilities or activities as a separate corporate entity until allergan s contribution to us of the optical medical device business 
the contribution of assets and distribution to allergan stockholders was completed on june  as a result of the spin off  we are an independent public company and allergan no longer maintains any stock ownership in us 
prior to the spin off  we entered into several agreements with allergan in connection with  among other things  transitional services  employee matters  manufacturing and tax sharing 
under the manufacturing agreement  which ended on june   allergan manufactured certain of our eye care products and vitrax viscoelastics from the date of the spin off 
we purchased these products from allergan at a price equal to allergan s fully allocated costs plus 
during and  we purchased million and million  respectively  of product from allergan 
on an annual basis  a pricing true up calculation was performed during the first calendar quarter after the end of each year 
this true up calculation was based on the actual volume of products shipped by allergan to us during the preceding year versus the forecasted volume submitted by us that was used to calculate the invoiced prices 
during the year  we periodically reviewed the volume of purchases and accrued for estimated shortfalls  if any 
in october  we received million from allergan for the final true up calculation for the last six months of the agreement 
in march  we made a payment of million to allergan based upon the true up calculation for the year ended december  these payments have been recorded as an increase decrease to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the tax sharing agreement governs allergan s and our respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes for any tax period ending before  on or after the spin off 
generally  allergan is liable for all pre spin off taxes except for pre spin off taxes attributable to our business for in addition  the tax sharing agreement provides that allergan is liable for taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the spin off 
during  we realized final adjustments to accrued  pre spin off taxes attributable to our business and payable to allergan pursuant to this agreement 
these adjustments included a million benefit from the resolution of a discrete item in the third quarter of  which was recorded in the income tax provision 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer  with the exception of intraocular lenses distributed on a consignment basis  which is upon notification of implantation in a patient 
we recognize procedural revenues and revenues from the sale of treatment cards to direct customers when we ship the treatment cards as we have no continuing obligations or involvement subsequent to shipment 
some customers finance the purchase or rental of their visx equipment directly from us over periods ranging from one to three years 
these financing agreements are classified as either rental or operating leases or sales type leases as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
under sales type leases  system revenues are recognized based on the net present value of the expected cash flow after installation to direct customers in the united states and japan or after shipment to international distributors 
under rental or operating lease arrangements  rental revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement 
we generally permit returns of product if such product is returned in a timely matter  in good condition  and through the normal channels of distribution 
however  we do not accept returns of treatment cards and we do not provide rights of return or exchange  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our visx product distributors 
return policies in certain international markets can be more stringent and are based on the terms of contractual agreements with the customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
to date  historical product returns have been within our estimates 
when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  certain allowances known and estimable at time of sale are recorded as a reduction to sales 
these items include cash discounts  allowances and rebates 
these items are reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable to the extent the customer will or is expected to reduce its payment on the related invoice amounts 
in addition  certain items such as rebates provided to customers that meet certain buying targets are paid to the customer subsequent to customer payment 
thus  such amounts are recorded as accrued liabilities 
these provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues and estimated customer inventory levels 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
to date  historical sales allowances have been within our estimates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
on a regular basis  we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence by analyzing estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
based on these evaluations  inventory balances are reduced  if necessary 
goodwill and long lived assets on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review performed during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
in a business combination  goodwill is allocated to our various reporting units based on relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we review the recoverability of goodwill by comparing each unit s fair value to the net book value of its assets 
if the book value of the reporting unit s assets exceeds its fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
additionally  we review the carrying amount of goodwill whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined such indicators are present and the review indicates goodwill will not be fully recoverable  based upon discounted estimated cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to implied fair value 
in the second quarters of  and  we performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets  and no impairment was indicated based on these tests 
effective january   our operating segments consist of three businesses cataract implant  laser vision correction and eye care 
accordingly  the annual impairment review in the second quarter of was based on reporting units that are aligned with the current operating segments 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairment to our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if required  an impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we record a liability for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates 
to the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
our income tax returns in several locations are being examined by the local taxation authorities 
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest  if any  have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations 
stock based compensation effective january   we began accounting for stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the fair value of stock options and espp purchase rights are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we also have an annual performance stock incentive program which provides the opportunity for certain executives to earn long term incentive compensation awards based upon specified market performance measures 
awards are to be settled in a number of restricted stock shares or units equal to the value of the award amount divided by the fair market value of our common stock on the date the performance criteria is deemed to have been met 
the fair value of the awards on the grant date is estimated using a lattice based valuation model 
the associated expense  if any  is recognized on a straight line basis over the period which starts from the date the annual program is approved by the board of directors through the end of the expected vesting period of the restricted stock awards 
acquired in process research and development costs to acquire in process research and development ipr d projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred 
the fair value of ipr d projects and technologies is estimated based upon management s assumptions such as projected regulatory approval dates  estimated future revenues and cost of goods sold of the products under development and expected sales and marketing costs 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the estimated results 
comparing fiscal years ended december   and the following table presents net sales and operating income by operating segment for  and  respectively net sales operating income in thousands cataract implant laser vision correction eye care total operating segments net sales for increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in was primarily the result of full year sales of products acquired in the visx acquisition in may  subsequent international expansion of our lvc business  as well as increased sales of technologically advanced products due to continued market acceptance of the products offset by the negative impact of the eye care recall and our business rationalization efforts

in process research and development 
in  we incurred an in process research and development ipr d charge of million related to the visx acquisition 
this charge represented the estimated fair value of projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the company recorded million of this amount in the second quarter of and million in the third quarter of the additional charge in the third quarter of resulted primarily from the completion of the ipr d valuation 
the fair value assigned to ipr d comprised the following projects high myopia for customvue million  excimer laser improvements million and presbyopia million 
the fair value of these projects was determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis using the income approach 
net cash flows attributable to these projects were discounted to their present values at a rate commensurate with the perceived risk  which for these projects ranged from to percent 
high myopia for customvue was forecasted to be approved for sale in the us in late fda approval was received in september a procedure to treat presbyopia is forecasted to be approved for sale in the us in mid management s best estimate of additional research and development expenses needed prior to expected fda approval for these procedures ranges from million to million 
additional research and development expenses in the range of million to million represent management s best estimate as to the additional r d expenses to bring excimer laser system improvements to market 
forecasted discounted cash flows for each product once launched include estimates for normal sustaining engineering and maintenance r d 
these projects are currently on track for the expected approval dates 
however  the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining the necessary approvals 
we can provide no assurance that the approvals will be received on this schedule or at all 
business repositioning costs 
on october   our board of directors approved a product rationalization and repositioning plan covering the discontinuation of non strategic cataract surgical and eye care products and the elimination or redeployment of resources that support these product lines

in the second quarter of  we exchanged approximately million shares of common stock and million of cash for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of these notes 
because these notes we not convertible into equity at such time  a non cash charge of million and a cash charge of million was recorded 
the million non cash charge was comprised of a charge of million representing the difference between the fair market value of million shares of common stock issued in exchange for the notes and the principal amount of notes exchanged and a charge of million representing the fair market value of million shares of common stock issued as a premium 
the million cash charge represented cash issued as a premium 
in the remainder of  we exchanged approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of these notes

other net non operating expense was million for other non operating expense of million for other non operating expense of million for included million paid for the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and early debt extinguishment costs and fees of million aggregating million partially offset by foreign exchange gains and interest income 
income taxes 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million on pre tax income of million 
the pre tax income in included a net gain on legal contingencies of million  for which we recorded income tax expense of million  and charges of million associated with the repurchase of convertible notes  which resulted in the recognition of partial deferred tax benefit of million 
additionally  we recorded a deferred tax benefit of million from stock based compensation of million under sfas r 
we have provided a tax provision at on the remaining pre tax income 
the increase in the tax rate on remaining pre tax income is due to the impact of the recall  repositioning and the related impact on realization of foreign tax credits 
income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates applicable to such income and we have provided for us federal income taxes and anticipated foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the pre tax loss in included an in process research and development charge of million  a non cash charge of million and a cash charge of million related to the exchange of the convertible senior subordinated notes and a charge of million associated with the termination of a distribution agreement in india with allergan  for which no tax benefit was provided on these items 
we have provided a tax provision at on the remaining income  which was partially offset by tax benefits from the american jobs creation act of and final adjustments with allergan  which are discussed below 
the american jobs creation act of was signed into law in october  which allowed companies to elect to repatriate cash into the united states in at a special  temporary effective tax rate of percent 
based on our evaluation of the amount of foreign earnings that we have elected to treat under this special provision  the income tax benefit of the repatriation was million in the lower tax rate in reflected continuing implementation of our long term tax strategies  as well as final adjustments of previously accrued pre spin off taxes attributable to our business in and payable to allergan pursuant to a pre spin tax sharing agreement 
these adjustments included a million benefit from the resolution of a discrete item in the third quarter of  which was recorded in the income tax provision 
we believe our future effective income tax rate may vary depending on our mix of domestic and international taxable income or loss and the various tax and treasury methodologies we implement  including our policy regarding repatriation of future accumulated foreign earnings 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million even though we had a pre tax loss of million 
we recorded such provision as no tax benefit has been recognized for the ipr d charge of million nor for the aggregate charge of million related to the exchange of the convertible senior subordinated notes 
we provided a tax provision at on the remaining income in the lower tax rate in reflected continuing implementation of our long term tax strategies 
net earnings loss 
net earnings loss was million  million and million in  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  adequate lines of credit  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents of million 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements  and we expect to do so in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in operating cash flow improved in compared to largely as a result of settlement of legal contingencies  the non cash impact of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization and loss on exchange of convertible notes 
other improvements included timing of collections on trade receivables and payments for interest on outstanding debt and income taxes  as well as the favorable impact of the visx acquisition 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in cash payments to finalize business repositioning actions in and recall costs 
operating cash flow decreased in compared to due to increases in cash paid for income taxes  timing of accounts payable payments and inventory buildup  partially offset by the favorable impact of the visx acquisition and timing of accounts receivable collections 
the inventory buildup was due in part to bridging stock related to the recent transfer of eye care manufacturing from allergan and the increases in the size and scope of our global manufacturing network 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the majority of capital expenditures were for the uppsala  sweden manufacturing facility to separate the facility from existing pfizer operations and related upgrades  and for upgrades to our eye care product manufacturing facility in madrid  spain 
the capital expenditures are primarily comprised of expenditures to upgrade our viscoelastics manufacturing facility in uppsala  sweden 
the amount includes million net cash paid primarily for the acquisition of visx 
the capital expenditures are primarily comprised of expansion of our manufacturing facilities in preparation for the transition away from the allergan manufacturing agreement  expenditures at the acquired manufacturing facilities and construction of research and development facilities at our leased headquarters 
the amount also includes the million pfizer acquisition purchase price  which was financed with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated notes and a million term loan 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
expenditures for demonstration demo and bundled equipment  primarily phacoemulsification and microkeratome surgical equipment  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we maintain demo and bundled equipment to facilitate future sales of similar equipment and related products to our customers 
expenditures for capitalized internal use software were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the software expenditures were due to acquisition related integrations and improvements to support common global technology platforms 
we capitalize internal use software costs after technical feasibility has been established 
in  we expect to invest approximately million to million in property  plant and equipment  demo and bundled equipment  and capitalized software as part of the overall expansion of our business 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  which primarily comprised million of debt repayments and financing related costs of million  offset by million from the sale of stock to employees and million of excess tax benefits 
proceeds of million from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes were used to repurchase million shares of amo common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which comprised million of proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes  million of borrowings primarily under the senior revolving credit facility  million of proceeds from the sale of stock to employees and million proceeds received after settling an interest rate swap agreement  reduced by million of debt repayments and million of financing related costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which primarily comprised million of proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes and a million term loan  partially offset by repayment of debt of million and financing related costs of million 
at december   approximately million of the revolving credit facility was reserved to support letters of credit issued on our behalf for normal operating purposes and we had approximately million undrawn and available revolving loan commitments 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under a short term loan from bank of ireland to our subsidiary  amo ireland 
this loan was supported by a million letter of credit and was paid in its entirety on february  and is no longer available for borrowing 
our senior credit facility provides that we will maintain certain financial and operating covenants which include  among other provisions  maintaining specific leverage and coverage ratios 
certain covenants under the senior credit facility may limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the senior credit facility prohibits dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  our senior credit facility is collateralized by a first priority perfected lien on  and pledge of  all of the combined company s present and future property and assets subject to certain exclusions  of the stock of the domestic subsidiaries  of the stock of the foreign subsidiaries and all present and future intercompany debts 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from some of our non us subsidiaries may result in additional tax costs 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restriction to fund ordinary business operations 
we believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and existing cash and equivalents  will provide sufficient resources to fund the expected capital expenditures  and to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
we are partially dependent upon the reimbursement policies of government and private health insurance companies 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation and competitive pricing  are continuing in many countries where we do business 
as a result of these changes  the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies 
while we have been unaware of significant price resistance resulting from the trend toward cost containment  changes in reimbursement policies and other reimbursement methodologies and payment levels could have an adverse effect on our pricing flexibility 
additionally  the current trend among us hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power 
the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase the pressure on product pricing  although we are unable to estimate the potential impact at this time 
inflation 
although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation may cause upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately   and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states  and a significant portion of our cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
therefore  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars as a result of changing currency exchange rates 
contractual obligations 
the following represents a list of our material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in millions long term debt  principal amount cash commitments for interest payments operating lease obligations it services other purchase obligations  primarily purchases of inventory and capital equipment off balance sheet arrangements 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  new accounting standards in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements 
the task force concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to eitf are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes by prescribing guidance for the recognition  derecognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits be disclosed 
the application of fin may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets 
the company will be required to adopt fin as of january  if there are changes in the net assets of the company as a result of the application of fin  the cumulative effects  if any  will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of fin and have not yet determined the effect on our earnings or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when qualifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the adoption of sab no 
in did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income and as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect on the balance sheet as of december  from the adoption of sfas no 
was based on the funded status of the defined benefit plans as of september   the measurement date of the plans assets and obligations 
we will be required to change the measurement date to december in fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we routinely monitor the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not expect to enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  there can be no assurance that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor  from an accounting and economic perspective  our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions  when applicable  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk 
at december   our debt comprises domestic borrowings of million of fixed rate debt 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted the interest rate on million of term loan borrowings from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
this interest rate swap qualified as a cash flow hedge and would have matured in july in april  we terminated the interest rate swap 
upon termination  we received approximately million and included the related gain of approximately million  which includes the accrued but unpaid net amount between us and the swap counterparty  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the second quarter of as a result of the repayment of the term loan in july  the gain on the interest rate swap of million was fully recognized as a reduction to the interest expense in the third quarter of the tables below present information about our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives for the years ended december  and december  maturing in thereafter total fair market value in thousands  except interest rates liabilities debt obligations fixed rate weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate total debt obligations weighted average interest rate december  maturing in thereafter total fair market value in thousands  except interest rates liabilities debt obligations fixed rate weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate total debt obligations weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk 
overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  we benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated net sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
we may enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we do not enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for trading purpose 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the japanese yen and the euro 
the foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to protect the value of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were economically designed to offset the changes in the revaluation of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
these forward contracts are denominated in currencies which represent material exposures 
the changes in the fair value of foreign currency option and forward contracts are recorded through earnings as unrealized loss gain on derivative instruments while any realized gains or losses on expired contracts are recorded through earnings as other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
any premium cost of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the options 
at december   there are no outstanding interest rate swaps 
the following tables provide information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of december  and the information is provided in us dollar amounts  as presented in our consolidated financial statements

the estimate of fair value is based on applicable and commonly used prevailing financial market information as of december  and the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments  together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures  will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments 
the impact of foreign exchange risk management transactions on income was a net realized gain loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which are recorded in other  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
