general anthracite capital  inc  a maryland corporation  and subsidiaries collectively  the company is a specialty finance company that invests in commercial real estate assets on a global basis 
the company seeks to generate income from the spread between the interest income  gains and net operating income on its commercial real estate assets and the interest expense from borrowings to finance its investments 
the company s primary activities are investing in high yielding commercial real estate debt and equity 
the company combines traditional real estate underwriting and capital markets expertise to maximize the opportunities arising from the continuing integration of these two disciplines 
the company focuses on acquiring pools of performing loans in the form of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs  issuing secured debt backed by cmbs and providing strategic capital for the commercial real estate industry in the form of mezzanine loan financing 
the company also began investing in diversified portfolios of commercial real estate in the united states during december the company commenced operations on march  the company s common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ahr 
the company s primary long term objective is to distribute dividends supported by earnings 
the company establishes its dividend by analyzing the long term sustainability of earnings given existing market conditions and the current composition of its portfolio 
this includes an analysis of the company s credit loss assumptions  general level of interest rates and projected hedging costs 
the company s principal focus is to invest in a diverse portfolio of primarily high yield commercial real estate loans and cmbs 
the cmbs that the company purchases are fixed income instruments similar to bonds that carry an interest coupon and stated principal 
the cash flow used to pay the interest and principal on the cmbs comes from a designated pool of first mortgage loans on commercial real estate the underlying loans 
underlying loans usually are originated by commercial banks or investment banks and are secured by a first mortgage on office buildings  retail centers  apartment buildings  hotels and other types of commercial real estate 
a typical loan pool may contain several hundred underlying loans with principal amounts of as little as  to over  the pooling concept permits significant geographic diversification 
converting loans into cmbs in this fashion allows investors to purchase these securities in global capital markets and to participate in the commercial real estate sector with significant diversification among property types  sizes and locations in one fixed income investment 
the type of cmbs issued from a typical loan pool is generally broken down by credit rating 
the highest rated cmbs will receive payments of principal first and is therefore least exposed to the credit performance of the underlying loan 
these securities will carry a credit rating of aaa and will be issued with a principal amount that represents some portion of the total principal amount of the underlying loan pool 
the cmbs that receive principal payments last are generally rated below investment grade bb or lower 
as the last to receive principal  these cmbs are also the first to absorb any credit losses incurred in the underlying loan pool 
typically  the principal amount of these below investment grade classes represents of the principal of the underlying loan pools 
the investor that owns the lowest rated  or non rated  cmbs class is designated as the controlling class representative for the underlying loan pool 
this designation allows the holder to assert a significant degree of influence over any workouts or foreclosures of defaulted underlying loans 
these securities are generally issued with a high yield to compensate for the credit risk inherent in owning the cmbs class which is the first to absorb losses 
the company s high yield commercial real estate loan strategy encompasses b notes defined below and mezzanine loans 
b notes and mezzanine loans are based on a similar concept of investing in a portion of the principal and interest of a specific loan instead of a pool of loans as in cmbs 
in the case of b notes the principal amount of a single loan is separated into a senior interest a note and a junior interest b note 
prior to a borrower default  the a note and the b note receive principal and interest pari passu  however after a borrower default  the a note would receive its principal and interest first and the b note would absorb the credit losses that occur  if any  up to the full amount of its principal 
the b note holder generally has certain rights to influence workouts or foreclosures 
the company invests in b notes as they provide relatively high yields with a degree of influence over dispositions 
mezzanine loans generally are secured by ownership interests in an entity that owns real estate 
these loans generally are subordinate to a first mortgage and would absorb a credit loss prior to the senior mortgage holder

real estate credit profile of below investment grade cmbs the company views its below investment grade cmbs investment activity as two portfolios controlling class cmbs and other below investment grade cmbs 
the company considers the cmbs securities where it maintains the right to influence the foreclosure workout process on the underlying loans its controlling class cmbs controlling class 
the distinction between the two is in the rights the company obtains with its investment in controlling class cmbs 
controlling class rights allow the company to influence the workout and or disposition of defaults that occur in the underlying loans 
these securities absorb the first losses realized in the underlying loan pools 
the coupon payment on the non rated security also can be reduced for special servicer fees charged to the trust 
the next highest rated security in the structure then generally will be downgraded to non rated and become the first to absorb losses and expenses from that point on 
at december   the company owns trusts where it is in the first loss position and is designated as the controlling class representative by owning the lowest rated or non rated cmbs class 
the total par of the loans underlying these securities was  at december   subordinated controlling class cmbs with a par of  were included on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition and subordinated controlling class cmbs with a par of  were held as collateral for cdo hy and cdo hy the company s other below investment grade cmbs have more limited rights associated with its ownership to influence the workout and or disposition of underlying loan defaults 
the total par of the company s other below investment grade cmbs at december  was  the average credit protection  or subordination level  of this portfolio is 
the company s investment in its subordinated controlling class cmbs securities by credit rating category at december  is as follows caption estimated fair adjusted purchase weighted average par value dollar price price dollar price subordination level

during  the par amount of the company s controlling class cmbs was reduced by  of this amount   of the par reductions were related to controlling class cmbs held in cdo hy and cdo hy further delinquencies and losses may cause the par reductions to continue and cause the company to conclude that a change in loss adjusted yield is required along with a write down of the adjusted purchase price through the income statement according to emerging issues task force eitf issue  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf 
also during  the loan pools were paid down by  pay down proceeds are distributed to the highest rated cmbs class first and reduce the percent of total underlying collateral represented by each rating category 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur  subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded  which would negatively affect their estimated fair value and therefore the company s net asset value 
reduced estimated fair value would negatively affect the company s ability to finance any such securities that are not financed through a cdo or similar matched funding vehicle 
in some cases  securities held by the company may be upgraded to reflect seasoning of the underlying collateral and thus would increase the estimated fair value of the securities 
during the twelve months ended december   securities in nine of the company s controlling class cmbs were upgraded by at least one rating agency and none were downgraded 
additionally  at least one rating agency upgraded of the company s non controlling class commercial real estate securities 
three of the company s investment grade reit debt securities were downgraded during the twelve months ended december  the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide to be the most relevant benchmark to measure credit performance and market conditions applicable to its controlling class cmbs holdings 
the year of issuance  or vintage year  is important  as older loan pools will tend to have more delinquencies than newly underwritten loans 
the company owns controlling class cmbs issued in       and comparable delinquency statistics referenced by vintage year as a percentage of par outstanding at december  are shown in the table below caption underlying delinquencies lehman brothers vintage year collateral outstanding conduit guide

the controlling class cmbs owned by the company have a delinquency rate of  which is consistent with industry averages 
during  the underlying collateral experienced early payoffs of  representing of the year end pool balance 
these loans were paid off at par with no loss 
aggregate losses related to the underlying collateral of  were realized during year ended december  this brings cumulative realized losses to  which is of total estimated losses 
these losses include special servicer and other workout expenses 
this experience to date is in line with the company s loss expectations 
realized losses and special servicer expenses are expected to increase on the underlying loans as the portfolio matures 
special servicer expenses are also expected to increase as portfolios mature 
to the extent that realized losses differ from the company s original loss estimates  it may be necessary to reduce or increase the projected yield on the applicable cmbs investment to better reflect such investment s expected earnings net of expected losses  from the date of purchase 
while realized losses on individual assets may be higher or lower than original estimates  the company currently believes its aggregate loss estimates and yields remain appropriate 
the company manages its credit risk through disciplined underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to influence the workout process for delinquent loans as early as possible 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions

as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur  subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded  which would negatively affect their estimated fair value and therefore the company s net asset value 
reduced estimated fair value will negatively affect the company s ability to finance any such securities that are not financed through a cdo or similar matched funding vehicle 
in some cases  securities held by the company may be upgraded to reflect seasoning of the underlying collateral and thus would increase the estimated fair value of the securities 
the company s interest income calculated in accordance with eitf for its cmbs is computed based upon a yield  which assumes credit losses will occur 
the yield to compute the company s taxable income does not assume there would be credit losses  as a loss can only be deducted for tax purposes when it has occurred 
this is the primary difference between the company s income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and taxable income 
as a result  for the years through  the company s gaap income was approximately  lower than its taxable income 
commercial real estate loan activity the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally emphasizes larger transactions located in metropolitan markets located in the united states and europe  as compared to the typical loan in the cmbs portfolio

the borrower did not repay the loan on the due date 
in addition  the senior mortgage holder did not grant the borrower s request for extension of time to accommodate a sale of the property or refinancing of the loan 
as a result  the loan is in default 
the company believes the underlying asset is sufficient collateral to repay the company s loan in full 
the underlying property is a hotel located in the south beach area of miami  florida 
during february  two other loans held by carbon ii defaulted 
the aggregate carrying value of the two loans on carbon ii s consolidated financial statements is   per loan 
the underlying properties for both loans are multi family assets being converted to condominiums that are located in florida 
carbon ii is negotiating a workout arrangement with the borrower for one loan  whereby the borrower will cure its default and make additional capital contributions to sustain the property while the borrower continues its sales program 
based on credit analysis performed for this property  carbon ii believes a loan loss reserve is not necessary at this time 
for the second loan  the borrower was not able to achieve sufficient condominium sales to complete the condominium conversion 
the borrower has indicated it will not contribute additional capital to sustain the rental property until such time as the condominium market recovers 
as a result  carbon ii is expected to take title to the property and currently intends to operate it as a rental property while preparing the property for sale 
based on the credit analysis performed for this property  carbon ii has established a loan loss reserve of  for the loan  of which the company s share is  all other commercial real estate loans in the carbon capital funds are performing as expected

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s accounting policies that are the most affected by management judgments  estimates and assumptions securities available for sale the company has designated certain investments in mortgage backed securities  mortgage related securities and certain other securities as available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
many of these investments are relatively illiquid  and management must estimate their values 
in making these estimates  management generally utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities  but may  under certain circumstances  adjust these valuations based on management s judgment 
changes in the valuations do not affect the company s reported net income or cash flows  but impact stockholders equity and  accordingly  book value per share 
management must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value that is other than temporary  and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its fair value  through earnings 
significant judgment by management is required in this analysis  which includes  but is not limited to  making assumptions regarding the collectability of the principal and interest  net of related expenses  on the underlying loans 
income on these securities is recognized based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
examples include  among other things  the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
additional factors that may affect the company s reported interest income on its commercial real estate securities include interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying commercial mortgage loans  the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the commercial mortgage loans underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real estate market including competition for tenants and their related credit quality and changes in market rental rates 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions 
the company recognizes interest income from its purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial interests beneficial interests other than beneficial interests of high credit quality  sufficiently collateralized to ensure that the possibility of credit loss is remote  or that cannot contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the company would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment in accordance with eitf accordingly  on a quarterly basis  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  the company calculates a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date and the revised cash flows 
the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
for other mortgage backed and related mortgage securities  the company accounts for interest income under sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases sfas no 
 using the effective yield method which includes the amortization of discount or premium arising at the time of purchase and the stated or coupon interest payments 
impairment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 when the estimated fair value of the security classified as available for sale has been below amortized cost for a significant period of time and the company concludes that it no longer has the ability or intent to hold the security for the period of time over which the company expects the values to recover to amortized cost  the investment is written down to its fair value 
the resulting charge is included in income  and a new cost basis is established 
additionally  under eitf  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows adjusted for cash receipts during the intervening period  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
accordingly  the security is written down to fair value with the resulting change being included in income  and a new cost basis established 
in both instances  the original discount or premium is written off when the new cost basis is established 
after taking into account the effect of an impairment charge  income is recognized under eitf or sfas no 
 as applicable  using the revised market yield for the security used in establishing the write down 
variable interest entities the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of anthracite capital  inc and its subsidiaries  which are wholly owned or controlled by the company or entities which are variable interest entities vies in which the company is the primary beneficiary under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin r 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs the majority of the vie s expected losses and or the majority of the expected returns 
the company has evaluated its investments for potential variable interests by evaluating the sufficiency of the entity s equity investment at risk to absorb losses 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company has analyzed the governing pooling and servicing agreements for each of its controlling class cmbs and believes that the terms are industry standard and are consistent with the qualifying special purpose entity qspe criteria 
however  there is uncertainty with respect to qspe treatment due to ongoing review by accounting standard setters  potential actions by various parties involved with the qspe  as well as varying and evolving interpretations of the qspe criteria under sfas no 
additionally  the standard setters continue to review the fin r provisions related to the computations used to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie 
future guidance from the standard setters may require the company to consolidate cmbs trusts in which the company has invested 
commercial mortgage loans the company purchases and originates commercial mortgage loans to be held as long term investments 
the company also has investments in private opportunity funds that invest in commercial mortgage loans that are managed by the manager 
management periodically must evaluate each loan for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan were determined to be impaired  the company would establish a reserve for probable losses and a corresponding charge to earnings 
given the nature of the company s loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate collateral  significant judgment of management is required in determining impairment and the resulting loan loss allowance  which includes but is not limited to making assumptions regarding the value of the real estate that secures the commercial mortgage loan 
equity investments for those investments in real estate entities where the company does not control the investee  or is not the primary beneficiary of a vie  but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee  the company uses the equity method of accounting

derivative instruments the company utilizes various hedging instruments derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures or to modify the interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of related company investments 
all derivatives are carried at fair value  generally estimated by management based on valuations provided by the counterparty to the derivative contract 
for accounting purposes  the company s management must decide whether to designate these derivatives as either a hedge of an asset or liability  securities available for sale  securities held for trading  or foreign currency exposure 
this designation decision affects the manner in which the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported 
securitizations when the company sells assets in securitizations  it can retain certain tranches which are considered retained interests in the securitization 
gain or loss on the sale of assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets securitized  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of securitization 
to obtain fair values  quoted market prices are used 
gain or loss on securitizations of financial assets is reported as a component of sale of securities available for sale on the consolidated statement of operations 
retained interests are carried at estimated fair value on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
adjustments to estimated fair value for retained interests classified as securities available for sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements reverse repurchase agreements accounting standard setters are currently reviewing the treatment of transactions where mortgage backed securities purchased from a particular counterparty are financed via a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty 
currently  the company records such assets and the related financing gross on the consolidated statement of financial condition  and the corresponding interest income and interest expense gross on the consolidated statement of operations 
any change in fair value of the security is reported through other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
 because the security is classified as available for sale 
however  in a transaction where the mortgage backed securities are acquired from and financed under a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty  the acquisition may not qualify as a sale from the seller s perspective under the provisions of sfas no 
in such cases  the seller may be required to continue to consolidate the assets sold to the company  based on their continuing involvement with such investments 
depending on the ultimate outcome of the accounting standard setters deliberations  the company may be precluded from presenting the assets gross on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition and should instead be treating the company s net investment in such assets as a derivative 
if it is determined that these transactions should be treated as investments in derivatives  the derivative instruments entered into by the company to hedge the company s interest rate exposure with respect to the borrowings under the associated repurchase agreements may no longer qualify for hedge accounting  and would then  as with the underlying asset transactions  also be marked to market through the consolidated statement of operations 
this potential change in accounting treatment does not affect the economics of the transactions but does affect how the transactions would be reported on the consolidated financial statements 
the company s cash flows  liquidity and ability to pay a dividend would be unchanged  and the company does not believe its reit taxable income or reit status would be affected 
the company s net equity would not be materially affected 
at december   the company has identified available for sale securities with a fair value of approximately  which had been purchased from and financed with reverse repurchase agreements totaling approximately  with the same counterparty since their purchase 
if the company were to change the current accounting treatment for these transactions at december   total assets and total liabilities would be reduced by approximately  variable interest entities the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of anthracite capital  inc and its subsidiaries  which are wholly owned or controlled by the company or entities which are vies in which the company is the primary beneficiary under fin r 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs the majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or the majority of the expected returns 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company has analyzed the governing pooling and servicing agreements for each of its controlling class cmbs and believes that the terms are industry standard and are consistent with the qspe criteria 
however  there is uncertainty with respect to qspe treatment due to ongoing review by accounting standard setters  potential actions by various parties involved with the qspe  as well as varying and evolving interpretations of the qspe criteria under sfas no 
future guidance from the accounting standard setters may require the company to consolidate cmbs trusts in which the company has invested

the company s ability to meet its long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by the company s lenders and investors to provide the company with financing will depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  the company s financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities

reverse repurchase agreements and credit facilities reverse repurchase agreements are secured loans generally with a term of days 
the interest rate is based on day libor plus a spread that is determined based on the asset pledged as security 
the terms include a daily mark to market provision that requires the posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines 
after the day period expires  there is no obligation for the lender to extend credit for an additional period 
this type of financing generally is available only for more liquid securities 
the interest rate charged on reverse repurchase agreements is usually the lowest relative to the alternatives due to the lower risk inherent in these transactions 
committed financing facilities represent multi year agreements to provide secured financing for a specific asset class 
these facilities include a mark to market provision requiring the company to repay borrowings if the value of the pledged asset declines in excess of a threshold amount 
a significant difference between committed financing facilities and reverse repurchase agreements is the term of the financing 
a committed facility provider generally is required to provide financing for the full term of the agreement  usually two to three years  rather than ninety days as generally used in the reverse repurchase market 
this longer term makes the financing of less liquid assets viable 
cdos issuance of secured term debt is generally done through a cdo offering in a private placement 
this entails creating a special purpose entity that holds assets used to secure the payments required of the debt issued 
asset cash flows generally are matched with the debt service requirements over their respective lives and an interest rate swap is used to match the fixed or floating rate nature of the coupon payments where necessary 
this type of transaction is usually referred to as match funding or term financing the assets 
there is no mark to market requirement in this structure and the debt cannot be called or terminated by the bondholders 
furthermore  the debt issued is non recourse to the issuer  and therefore permanent reductions in asset value do not affect the liquidity of the company 
however  since the company expects to earn a positive spread between the income generated by the assets and the expense of the debt issued  a permanent impairment of any of the assets would negatively affect the spread over time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk  credit curve risk and foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit curve risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial real estate securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
at december   all of the company s collateralized liabilities outside of the cdos are floating rate based on a market spread to libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or rising interest rates 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk based on a method that takes into consideration the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities  including preferred stock 
the company s objective is to acquire assets and match fund the purchase so that interest rate risk associated with financing these assets is reduced or eliminated 
the primary risks associated with acquiring and financing these assets under day repurchase agreements and committed borrowing facilities are mark to market risk and short term rate risk 
certain secured financing arrangements provide for an advance rate based upon a percentage of the estimated fair value of the asset being financed 
market movements that cause asset values to decline would require a margin call or a cash payment to maintain the relationship between asset value and amount borrowed 
a cash flow based cdo is an example of a secured financing vehicle that does not require a mark to market to establish or maintain a level of financing 
when financed assets are subject to a mark to market margin call  the company carefully monitors the interest rate sensitivity of those assets 
the duration of the assets financed which are subject to a mark to market margin call was years based on net asset value at december  this means that a basis point increase in interest rates would cause a margin call of approximately  net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates is analyzed using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the libor curve  increase or decrease and that the yield curves of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
regarding the table below  all changes in net interest income are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
caption projected percentage change in earnings per share given libor movements change in libor  projected change basis points in earnings per share 
del base case del 
the company s gaap book value incorporates the estimated fair value of the company s interest bearing assets but it does not incorporate the estimated fair value of the company s interest bearing fixed rate liabilities and preferred stock 
the fixed rate liabilities and preferred stock generally will reduce the actual interest rate risk of the company from an economic perspective even though changes in the estimated fair value of these liabilities are not reflected in the company s reported book value 
the company focuses on economic risk in managing its sensitivity to interest rates and maintains an economic duration within a band of to years 
at december   economic duration for the company s entire portfolio was years 
this implies that for each basis points of change in interest rates the company s economic value will change by approximately 
at december  the company estimates its economic value  or net asset value of its common stock to be  a reconciliation of the economic duration of the company to the duration of the reported book value of the company s common stock is as follows 
del duration gaap book value at december  less duration contribution of cdo i liabilities duration contribution of cdo ii liabilities duration contribution of cdo iii liabilities duration contribution of cdo hy liabilities duration contribution of euro cdo liabilities duration contribution of series c preferred stock duration contribution of junior subordinated notes duration contribution of senior unsecured notes economic duration at december  del 
the gaap book value of the company s common stock is per share 
as indicated in the table above a basis point change in interest rates will change reported book value by approximately  or  as indicated above  approximately  of that change would be required to meet margin calls in the event rates rise by basis points 
credit risk the company s portfolios of commercial real estate assets are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
before acquiring a controlling class security  the company will perform an analysis of the quality of all of the loans proposed 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles are either removed from the proposed pool or the company receives a price adjustment 
the company underwrites its controlling class cmbs investments assuming the underlying loans will suffer a certain dollar amount of defaults and these defaults will lead to some level of realized losses 
loss adjusted yields are computed based on these assumptions and applied to each class of security supported by the cash flow on the underlying loans 
the most significant variables affecting loss adjusted yields include  but are not limited to  the number of defaults  the severity of loss that occurs subsequent to a default and the timing of the actual loss 
the different rating levels of cmbs will react differently to changes in these assumptions 
the lowest rated securities b or lower are generally more sensitive to changes in timing of actual losses 
the higher rated securities b or higher are more sensitive to the severity of losses and timing of cash flows 
the company generally assumes that all of the principal of a non rated security and a significant portion  if not all  of ccc and a portion of b rated securities will not be recoverable over time 
the loss adjusted yields of these classes reflect that assumption  therefore  the timing of when the total loss of principal occurs is the most important assumption in determining value 
the interest coupon generated by a security will cease when there is a total loss of its principal regardless of whether that principal is paid 
therefore  timing is of paramount importance because the longer the principal balance remains outstanding  the more interest coupon the holder receives  which results in a larger economic return 
alternatively  if principal is lost faster than originally assumed  there is less opportunity to receive interest coupon  which results in a lower or possibly negative return 
if actual principal losses on the underlying loans exceed estimated loss assumptions  the higher rated securities will be affected more significantly as a loss of principal may not have been assumed 
the company generally assumes that all principal will be recovered by classes rated b or higher 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions and careful monitoring of loan performance 
after the securities have been acquired  the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or acceleration of the timing of an expected loss will cause a reduction in the expected yield and therefore reduce the earnings of the company 
furthermore  the company may be required to write down a portion of the adjusted purchase price of the affected assets through its consolidated statements of operations 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s controlling class cmbs  without a significant acceleration of those losses  would reduce gaap income by approximately per share of common stock per year and cause a significant write down at the time the loss assumption is changed 
the amount of the write down depends on several factors  including which securities are most affected at the time of the write down  but is estimated to be in the range of to per share based on a doubling of expected losses 
a significant acceleration of the timing of these losses would cause the company s net income to decrease 
the company s exposure to a write down is mitigated by the fact that most of these assets are financed on a non recourse basis in the company s cdos  where a significant portion of the risk of loss is transferred to the cdo bondholders 
at december   securities with a total estimated fair value of  are collateralizing the cdo borrowings of  therefore  the company s preferred equity interest in the five cdos is  per share 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the re pricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the company s objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid  as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category 
currency risk the company has foreign currency rate exposures related to certain cmbs and commercial real estate loans 
the company s principal currency exposures are to the euro and british pound 
changes in currency rates can adversely impact the fair values and earnings of the company s non us holdings 
the company mitigates this impact by utilizing local currency denominated financings on its foreign investments and foreign currency forward commitments and swaps to hedge the net exposure
