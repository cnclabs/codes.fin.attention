item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation founded by daniel r 
baty and two other long time associates in mr 
baty is chairman of our board of directors  chief executive officer  and one of our largest shareholders 
he is also a party to a number of agreements with us and is referred to frequently in discussions of the business 
in november  we completed our initial public offering 
from through  we expanded rapidly through acquisition and internal development and by december   operated assisted living communities with  units 
we believe  however  that during this expansion  the assisted living industry became over built  creating an environment characterized by sluggish or falling occupancy and market resistance to rate increases 
as a result  in we began an increased focus first on raising our occupancy and later on rate development  operating efficiencies  and cost controls 
this focus has continued throughout and we believe the operating environment of the assisted living industry has been improving over the past several years resulting in occupancy gains and increases in the average monthly rate 
these operating improvements have also resulted in greater access to capital 
we believe these dynamics have resulted in the consolidation of smaller local and regional operators into the larger national operators  and anticipate this consolidation of the industry will continue 
because of these circumstances  we have been able to complete several acquisitions or leases in the last few years  although at a slower pace in and although opportunities for further expansion have been available over the past two years  we have been selective in our growth as we have seen a sharp increase in market prices 
as a result  we have focused more on internal growth through expansion of existing properties and construction of new communities 
we currently have expansion projects in eight of our communities and will continue to look at other expansion opportunities where the market conditions are favorable 
in addition  we have several development projects in various stages of completion in several locations 
since the beginning of  we have converted of our managed properties to owned or leased  terminated management agreements on communities  and entered into new management contracts on communities  resulting in a decline of managed properties from at the beginning of to at the end of in addition  we have completed sale leaseback transactions on communities  acquired nine one of which we formerly managed and disposed of two properties  resulting in a decline of owned properties from to over the same period 
finally  we have converted properties from managed to leased  acquired new leased properties  converted from owned to leased  and terminated one lease over that period  resulting in an increase of leased properties from to those communities we own and lease  and which are included in our consolidated portfolio  increased from at the beginning of to at the end of  reflecting both our increasing confidence in the assisted living industry and the availability of capital 
in  we expect to continue our focus on increasing occupancy and rates  as well as reviewing acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of our property interests 
as of december  as of december  as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units owned leased consolidated portfolio managed admin services joint venture partnership operated portfolio percentage increase decrease owned communities increased since december due to the acquisition of three communities in arkansas and one in washington 
of the leased communities at december   are accounted for as operating leases  in which the assets and liabilities of the communities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for as capital leases  in which a long term asset and corresponding liability is established on our balance sheet 
the remaining leased communities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as owned communities because of accounting requirements related to sale leaseback accounting  notwithstanding the legal sale of the communities and their subsequent leasing by us 
since  we have terminated management agreements on six communities and started management of one building in december in december  we began managing communities from a joint venture in which we hold a interest 
the percentage increase indicates the change from the prior year 
two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit  computed by dividing the total revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally rely on an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio  which includes the communities we own and lease  and our operating portfolio  which also includes the communities we manage 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average monthly revenue per unit increased from  to  and to  in   and  respectively 
the change from to represents an increase of  or and from to  an increase of  or 
this level of increase is partially due to repositioning several groups of our acquired communities over the past year to be more rate competitive and to establish a new presence in their respective markets 
in addition  increased competition in certain locations has prevented us from raising rates to the extent we otherwise would have desired 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average occupancy rate was in  increasing to and in and  respectively 
we believe that this increase in occupancy rates reflects industry wide factors  such as the declining supply of vacant units as well as our own actions and policies 
we continue to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community  as witnessed by the increase in occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit from through since our inception in  we have incurred operating losses totaling approximately million as of december  we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and increased emphasis on risk management and financial reporting controls  the impact in the early years on many of our leases from capital and financing lease treatments  and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
while we have realized growth in both our occupancy and average monthly rates  we anticipate continued losses in the near term until such time as our occupancy stabilizes at levels of approximately 
our current emphasis is on maximization of cash flows as we work toward improvements in occupancy and average rates  selective growth  and changes in our capital structure  such as acquisition of leased properties and refinancing of existing high rate debt 
significant transactions from through  and continuing into  we entered into a number of transactions that affected the number of communities we own  lease  and manage  our financing arrangements  and our capital structure 
these transactions are summarized below

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to resident programs and incentives such as move in fees  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  contingencies  self insured retention  health insurance  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents we believe the following accounting policies are most significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we are self insured for professional liability claims and accrue losses based upon actuarial estimates of the total aggregate liability for claims within the current year  plus related administrative expenses 
we make periodic adjustments to our total liability for all open years from through if actuarial estimates suggest our exposure has changed 
losses are covered through a self insurance pool agreement  which includes of our managed communities on a unit of capacity basis 
should losses exceed the actuarial estimates  additional expense may be accrued at the time of such determination 
we deposit funds with an administrator based in part on a fixed schedule and in part as losses are actually paid 
the funds held by the administrator are recorded as a prepaid asset 
the prepaid asset is reduced as claims are paid from the account 
during  we acquired separate general liability commercial coverage that continues to be in place throughout for health insurance  we self insure each covered member up to a certain level above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs for certain covered members 
health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
if these estimates are insufficient  additional charges may be required 
workers compensation insurance coverage applies for specific insurable states excluding texas  new york for a part of  washington  ohio  and west virginia through a high deductible  collateralized insurance policy 
the policy premium is based upon standard rates applied to estimated annual payroll 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to administer the claims  and claim expenses are paid from the collateral account 
the sum of the premium and related costs  estimated administration costs  and actuarial based estimated losses is accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll 
the cash collateral paid under the plan is carried as a prepaid asset on the balance sheet and is reduced as claims are paid from the account by the administrator 
at policy expiration each year  an insurer audit is conducted to adjust premiums based on actual  rather than estimated  annual payroll 
the insurer also audits the total incurred claim amount at least annually and may adjust the applicable policy year collateral requirement 
if there is a reasonable expectation that the total incurred losses will be less than the posted collateral  then the excess cash collateral will be returned to the company 
for part of  we insured occupational injuries and illness in new york through participation in a self insured group pool on a guaranteed cost insurance policy basis  with the premium payable monthly 
the insurer group contracts with an independent third party administrator on behalf of its members to manage the claims  and claim expenses are paid by the insurer 
during  new york was added to our collateralized insurance policy discussed above 
for work related injuries in texas  we provide work related injury benefits through a qualified state sponsored plan 
claim expenses are paid as incurred and estimated losses are accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll 
an insurance policy is in place to cover liability losses in excess of a deductible amount 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to manage the claims 
the cost of this insurance is accrued monthly 
we also contract with an independent third party to certify the actuarial estimate of ultimate losses for workers compensation under the collateralized policy 
claims and expenses incurred under the collateralized policy are shared among the participants through a self insurance pooling agreement which includes the managed communities  unless such community is located in the specific states mentioned above 
costs are allocated to each participant based on annual payroll

 as amended  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for  generally  all share based payment transactions with employees 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield  and weighted average option life 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
before the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees to account for stock based awards 
under this method  no compensation expense was recorded provided the exercise price was equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our residents to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our residents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized which at this time shows a net asset valuation of zero 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
however  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
primarily due to the gain on sale of our investment in alterra  we utilized most of our available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards in we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  long term investments  and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
an impairment review is performed quarterly or whenever a change in condition occurs  which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual communities 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
we account for leases as operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
the determination of the classification of leases is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
leases are generally accounted for as operating leases to the extent the underlying lease does not i transfer ownership by the end of the lease term  ii contain a bargain purchase option  iii include a lease term equal to or greater than of the economic life of the leased property  or iv include minimum lease payments for which the present value equals or exceeds of the fair value of the underlying leased property 
those leases that meet one of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents criteria described above cannot be accounted for as operating leases but are accounted for as capital leases 
for properties under capital lease arrangements  an asset is established on the balance sheet based on the present value of the rent payments not to exceed the fair value of the underlying leased property  including base rent  fixed annual increases and any other payment obligations over the lease term  and a corresponding long term liability is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the lease obligation and the capital lease asset is depreciated over the term of the lease 
typically  capital lease treatment results in greater depreciation and interest than actual lease payments paid in the early years of the leases and less depreciation and interest than actual rent paid in the later years of the leases 
properties that are sold and leased back and for which we have continuing involvement are accounted for as financing arrangements  in which the property remains on the balance sheet and a financing obligation is recorded generally equal to the purchase price of the properties sold 
the impact on the statement of operations is similar to a capital lease 
properties under operating leases are not included on the balance sheet and are accounted for in the statement of operations as facility lease expense for actual rent paid to the extent any increases in rent is considered to be contingent and not determinable 
in cases where there are rent escalator provisions that have fixed or determinable increases  the operating leases are accounted for as the total rent for the term of the lease  including both base rent and fixed annual increases  on a straight line basis over the lease term 
this accounting treatment results in greater facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the earlier years of the respective leases and less facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the later years of the lease 
our accounting policy regarding contingent liabilities is to recognize obligations if they are probable and estimable in accordance with sfas accounting for contingencies based on management s best estimate of the ultimate outcome 
if a legal judgment is rendered against us or a settlement offer has been tendered  then we believe that we have a probable liability and we accrue the full amount of the judgment or settlement offer 
our long term investments consist of investments in joint ventures with equity interests ranging from to 
we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting 
in determining the accounting treatment for these investments  we consider various factors such as our ownership interest  our ability to influence decisions  our participating rights  and whether the joint venture is a variable interest entity  and if so  if we are the primary beneficiary 
we review the recoverability of our investments at least quarterly  or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired

twelve months ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt percentage points occupancy grew from marketing initiatives in existing communities and from the acquisition or leasing of the eight additional communities with higher occupancy levels 
the increase in revenue per unit was primarily attributable to rate increases in the previously existing communities and higher occupancy in our higher rate memory loss units

significant factors impacting the change in community operating expense between the periods were adjustments to our professional and general liability insurance accrual 
we recorded an additional million professional and general liability insurance accrual in  to reflect the settlement experience of claims closed during the year  primarily from claims originating in and  and to reflect an updated estimate of ultimate losses for all years from to  based upon an actuarial valuation report 
however  in  considering the updated settlement claims history  we reduced our professional and general liability insurance accrual by million  based upon an updated actuarial valuation report 
thus  the impact on the change from year to year of these two adjustments was an expense reduction of million 
another factor impacting the change in community operating expenses between the periods was a reduction in workers compensation expense of million due to revised estimates of our ultimate exposure under our workers compensation programs and claims paid history 
the adjustment was based upon an actuarial valuation report 
an additional factor impacting the change in community operating expenses between the periods was an accrual of million recorded in related to the texas medicaid settlement discussed under legal proceedings 
aside from the items noted above  community operations expense increased million  or 
approximately million of this increase was from the addition of eight new communities 
of the remaining increase of million in community operations expense  approximately million was increased staffing costs and approximately million was due to increases in utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses

we leased communities under operating leases as of december  and interest income year ended december  d d in thousands interest income as a percent of revenue ppt the increase in interest income of million was primarily attributable to interest earned on investments of cash that was received in the sale of our ownership interest in alterra and interest income earned on restricted deposits

interest expense increased by  after adjusting for the settlement impact noted above 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of million relating to debt financing associated with three new arkansas communities acquired in december   relating to two new communities under capital leases acquired in march   from the new million loan we entered into in connection with our series b stock conversion in june   related to the acquisition of arbor place in july  offset by a decline in interest expense from the pay down of principal balances over the past year

in addition  the income tax benefit for includes an adjustment related to the finalization of our tax return 
other than the loss carry back benefit discussed above  no benefit has been recognized for the company s net deferred tax assets as management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   is due to federal and state income and franchise tax liabilities on operating income primarily due to differences between tax and financial accounting treatment for capital and financing and straight line lease expense and from gains on sale of our alterra and senior med investments 
net income loss and property related expense in comparing the net income for to the net loss for  management believes it is important to consider the impact of lease accounting on our property related expenses  which includes depreciation and amortization  facility lease expense  and interest expense that is directly related to our communities 
the property related expenses directly associated with our accounting for leases  which includes operating leases  capital leases  financing leases  and straight line accounting for rent escalators for many of our operating leases  is presented in the table below 
these lease accounting treatments generally result in greater property related expense than actual lease payments made in the early years of the affected leases and less property related expense than actual lease payments made in later years

for most of  we had million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures that matured january  of the full principal amount  million was paid at maturity in january the remaining million principal amount of debentures were replaced with new convertible subordinated debentures that are due july   pursuant to an exchange offer completed by us in november see note convertible debentures of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  as a result of an offer to pay a cash incentive if holders converted their debentures to common stock  million principal amount of debentures was converted into common stock and are no longer outstanding 
we will pay million in connection with such conversion on april  in   and  we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  the cash flows have not always been sufficient to pay all our long term obligations and we have been dependent upon third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations 
we cannot guarantee that  if necessary in the future  such transactions will be available timely or at all  or on terms attractive to us 
in  and continuing through  we refinanced substantially all of our debt obligations  extending the maturities of such financings to dates in or thereafter  at which time we will need to refinance or otherwise repay the obligations 
as a consequence of our property and lease transactions in  our long term debt has increased from million at december   to million at december  our obligations under operating leases have decreased from million to million  and our capital lease and financing obligations have decreased from million to million 
in particular  the number of communities we lease increased from at december   to at december  we believe that  on the basis of the operating results of these communities many of which we managed prior to the commencement of the leases  the cash flow from such communities will be adequate to support the increased lease obligations 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor 
such cross default provisions affect the majority of our properties 
accordingly  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted 
defaults can include certain financial covenants  which generally relate to lease coverage and cash flow 
in addition  we are required to maintain the leased properties in a reasonable and prudent manner 
for the year ended december   we were in violation of one or more covenants in certain of our leases  but obtained waivers from the owners such that we were still deemed to be in compliance and thus  were not in default 
the waivers expire on january  management believes that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow or have adequate cash reserves for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through at least management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement could have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  but we do not expect it to be significant 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying current year financial statement misstatements 
the interpretations in sab  which expresses the sec s staff views  were issued to address the diversity in the practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for a build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
the sec staff indicated that companies should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in material misstatement 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on emeritus 
inflation could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs  which accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended december  in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
non gaap measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position  or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be included in most gaap measures 
in this report  we define and use the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda  as set forth below definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as follows net income loss to common shareholders before preferred stock dividends  gains or losses  net of tax  in discontinued operations  provision or benefit for income taxes  equity earnings or losses in unconsolidated joint ventures  gains or losses on sale of assets or investments  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses  amortization of deferred gains  non cash stock option compensation expense  interest expense  interest income  and other non cash unusual adjustments adjusted ebitda management s use of adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is useful in identifying trends in our day to day performance because it excludes items that have little or no significance on our day to day operations 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
adjusted ebitda provides us with a measure of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  and interest expense associated with our capital structure 
this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents limitations of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings losses to calculate adjusted ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income loss includes the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant affect on our financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly impacting our current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties 
if the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our performance and results of operations 
we use this non gaap measure to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income loss  income from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net income loss to adjusted ebitda presented below  along with our consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  this measure as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda for the three months and year ended december  and three months ended year ended december  december  net income loss from common shareholders preferred dividends gain loss on sale  net of tax benefit  in discontinued operations provision benefit for income taxes equity earnings losses in unconsolidated joint ventures gains losses on sale of long term investments depreciation and amortization impairment loss on long term investment amortization of deferred gains non cash stock option compensation expenses interest expense interest income other non cash unusual activity reversal of texas settlement accrued in professional and workers compensation liability adjustments adjusted ebitda 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading  none of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  the table presents principal repayments in thousands of dollars and current weighted averages of interest rates on these obligations as of december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt fixed rate capital lease and financing obligations convertible debentures in march  million of our million in convertible debentures were converted to common stock and are no longer outstanding 
the remaining balance of million is due in at december   we had no variable rate borrowings so our earnings are not affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
however  we do have certain operating lease obligations based on libor  with a libor cap of approximately 
as of december   the libor rate was at the cap and we currently have no variable rate exposure for additional lease expense 
this analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
