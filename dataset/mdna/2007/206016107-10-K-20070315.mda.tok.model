item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as limited operating and sales history  the uncertainty of market acceptance of our product  dependence on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement  effectiveness and safety of our product over the long term  our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental clearances or approvals to market our product  our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology  our ability to manage our expansion or any acquisition  our dependence on suppliers intense competition in the medical device industry  the inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls and other factors referenced in this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market the essure permanent birth control system  an innovative and proprietary medical device for women that was approved for marketing in the united states in november by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
the essure system uses a soft and flexible micro insert that is delivered into a woman s fallopian tubes to provide permanent birth control by causing a benign tissue in growth that blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure micro insert and the subsequent tissue growth prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes and therefore prevents fertilization 
the essure procedure the essure procedure is typically performed as an outpatient procedure and is intended to be a less invasive and a less costly alternative to tubal ligation  the leading form of birth control in the united states and worldwide 
laparoscopic tubal ligation and tubal ligation by laparotomy typically involve abdominal incisions and or punctures  general or regional anesthesia  four to ten days of normal recovery time and the risks associated with an incisional procedure 
the essure procedure does not require cutting or penetrating the abdomen  which lowers the likelihood of post operative pain due to the incisions punctures  and it can be performed in an outpatient setting without general or regional anesthesia 
in the pivotal trial of the essure system  the total procedure time averaged minutes  with an average of minutes of hysteroscopic time to place the essure micro insert 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  the essure system is effective without drugs or hormones 
there is a three month waiting period after the procedure during which the woman must use another form of birth control while tissue in growth occurs 
at days following the procedure  the patient completes a follow up examination called a hysterosalpingogram  or hsg  which can determine whether the device was placed successfully and whether the fallopian tubes are occluded 
we believe that the essure system is also an attractive alternative to tubal ligation for physicians  hospitals and payers 
the essure system is a less invasive permanent birth control option for physicians to offer to their patients  hospitals are able to utilize their facilities more cost effectively with the essure procedure compared with tubal ligation  and payers are able to experience cost reductions resulting from the elimination of overhead and procedural costs related to anesthesia and post operative hospital stays associated with tubal ligations 
we also believe the essure system is a viable alternative to other temporary methods of birth control being used when there is no intention of having children in the future 
in addition  payers may also benefit from the reduction of unplanned pregnancies associated with non permanent methods of birth control used by patients who have chosen to avoid the drawbacks of traditional permanent birth control methods but who may elect to use the essure system 
published reports estimate that  tubal ligation procedures are performed each year in the united states 
we intend to tap into this market and establish the essure procedure as the gold standard for permanent birth control 
the essure system is currently being marketed in multiple countries 
in november we received approval from the fda to market the essure system in the united states 
in  we were given approval to affix the ce mark to the essure system  indicating that the essure system is certified for sale throughout the european union  subject to compliance with local regulations such as registration with health ministries and or particular requirements regarding labeling or distribution 
in  the essure permanent birth control system was listed with australia s therapeutic goods administration  which allows us to market and sell the essure system in australia 
in december  we made the decision to terminate our direct subsidiary operations in australia and convert to an independent distributor 
this decision was largely a cost reduction measure due to of the small size of the australian market and our inability to manage a direct operation to a cash flow positive position 
we have entered into a distribution agreement and the transition was completed in january in canada  we received clearance from health canada to market the essure system in canada in november we currently have distributors in australia  canada and france  which covers europe  middle east  africa  mexico  central america and south america 
on february   we entered into an amendment to the share purchase and call option agreement dated january  between conceptus  conceptus sas  or sas  and the purchasers party thereto and an amendment to the distribution agreement between the conceptus and sas  dated january  pursuant to the amendment to the share purchase and call option agreement  we agreed to exercise our call option to acquire sas sometime between january  and january  subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions and also agreed not to exercise the call option in pursuant to the amendment to the distribution agreement  sas agreed to increase the price it pays to us for the essure product 
effectiveness of the essure system in july  we received approval from the fda to extend effectiveness data on the essure product labeling 
the premarket approval  or pma  supplement filed in late january supports an extension of the effectiveness rate of the essure system to after four years and after five years of follow up  from the previously approved at three years 
the five year effectiveness was demonstrated in a small portion of the women undergoing clinical studies 
five year follow up of all patients in clinical trials is ongoing 
in september  we received approval from the fda to terminate our post approval study with physicians who were newly trained in performing the essure procedure due to the positive placement data obtained 
the purpose of the post approval study  required by the fda as a condition of the november approval of the essure system  was to determine the rate of successful bilateral placements of the essure micro inserts at first attempt with a large number of newly trained physicians who were not part of the previous clinical studies 
although treatment of the total number of patients required by fda had not been completed  the data obtained to date provided us with the opportunity to request that the fda permit an early termination of the study 
because of the fda ruling  the pma supplement submitted in march has been re classified as a final report 
the results of the post approval study demonstrated an improvement in placement rates from those obtained in the pivotal study and we will seek to obtain a new placement rate claim for the product using this new data 
in november  we filed a pma supplement with the fda in order to obtain approval to modify the essure physician and patient labeling to reflect a first procedure bilateral placement rate based on results of the post approval study 
in october  we received such approval from the fda 
penetration we require physicians to be preceptored for between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
as of december   the increase of physicians that have been trained or that are in the process of training has been commensurate with the increase in sales 
the level of sales for the essure system  particularly in this early period of adoption  is highly dependent on the number of physicians trained to perform the procedure 
however  we understand that a strong base of trained physicians does not necessarily correlate to an increase in revenue proportionately 
furthermore  there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant from inception to date 
reimbursement of the essure procedure market acceptance of the essure system depends in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
we believe that physician advocacy of our product will be required to continue to obtain reimbursement 
as of december   we have received positive reimbursement decisions for the essure procedure from most private insurers and of the medicaid programs in the country 
we intend to continue our effort to educate payers of the cost effectiveness of our product  and to establish further programs to help physicians to navigate reimbursement issues 
in july  the unitedhealthcare group  or uhc  approved the essure procedure for reimbursement 
in addition  in february  we received coverage from cigna corporation  or cigna 
as with all healthcare plans  coverage will vary and is dependent upon the individual s specific benefit plan 
effective january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the medicare national unadjusted average payment for hysteroscopic sterilization  the cpt code  is when performed in a hospital and  when performed in a physician s office 
this compares to a medicare national average payment for tubal ligation  the current standard of care for permanent female sterilization  of in addition  in the cms final rule for the outpatient prospective payment system or opps  which assigns hospital outpatient reimbursement amounts  the cpt code was assigned a medicare national average of  in  the cpt code was moved from group which had a national average reimbursement of to group which has a national average reimbursement of  we believe these values are very favorable for the essure procedure and will help in establishing increased utilization of the device amongst doctors 
we expect that the new code  once the process to establish it at all private payers that have given a favorable coverage decision is complete  will significantly ease the burden on a physician s office in obtaining reimbursement for the essure procedure and accelerate the coverage of the essure procedure by private insurance companies and medicaid 
this process is not automatic following receipt of the new cpt code  however  and we anticipate continuing to focus on reimbursement issues for sometime in the future  both to secure our code and payment schedule into the payers databases  as well as to help the physician negotiate a favorable contract for payment off that schedule 
in mid august  the msac division recommended against public funding for the essure procedure  citing insufficient evidence for safety  effectiveness and cost effectiveness 
the overall market for female sterilization in australia is very small and we believe that our market penetration will remain limited by the msac decision until such time as we are able to submit sufficient long term data to obtain public funding 
adoption of the essure system the essure system is a novel product in the contraception market  which is dominated by procedures that are well established among physicians and patients and are routinely taught to new physicians 
as a result  we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our product 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices  partly because of perceived liability risks 
our biggest challenge is to speed up the adoption process to make the essure procedure the standard of care for permanent birth control 
the following discussion summarizes our program in the united states to increase adoption of the essure procedure 
first  we are focused on obtaining favorable coverage decisions from payers representing the private paying and state paying medicaid systems 
we are also focused on getting the cpt code and payment schedule implemented at all of the payers that have given a coverage decision 
until such time as the code is completely implemented and all major payers have provided a coverage decision  we have developed a field based tactical reimbursement group aimed at educating the physician and office staff regarding payer procedures following a declined claim  including appeals and petitioning procedures 
typically a newly covered product will go through a period where claims are either inadvertently declined or are paid at the incorrect amount 
in either instance  the physician is reluctant to perform additional procedures until payment has been secured for earlier cases  causing a decline in utilization 
our tactical reimbursement focus is intended to give the physician and his her staff the tools to ensure that claims will ultimately be paid and thereby encourages the physician to continue performing the essure procedure despite reimbursement issues 
this tactical reimbursement group is generally targeting specific accounts with the aim of eventually meeting with all of our accounts so as to provide them with the knowledge of how to file and follow up on claims on a payer by payer basis 
second  we are expanding our sales territories and channels of distribution so as to increase our call frequency on physicians 
from january  to december   we added a substantial number of sales positions and are expecting to add more in also  we have included regional distributors of women s gynecology products to our marketing efforts 
among other responsibilities  our sales representatives are attempting to increase penetration and utilization of the essure procedure  as well as to facilitate the movement of the essure procedure to the in the office environment 
third  we have entered into certain strategic agreements in the past and we may explore such opportunities in the future 
we intend for these agreements to provide us with the ability to increase awareness  gain market presence and credibility  accelerate our ability to train doctors  as well as expand our market opportunity by driving adoption among a group of physicians not previously targeted by our marketing programs 
the success of these joint marketing campaigns will depend upon the effectiveness of our sales force training programs  market demand for essure procedures in conjunction with the products marketed by strategic partners and the efforts and commitment of strategic partners to the program 
we cannot be certain how successful these programs will be  if at all 
fourth  we are attempting to increase patient awareness  so as to increase the number of women that will ask for information about the essure procedure 
we may achieve this through radio campaigns  direct mail and print media magazine advertisements aimed at increasing consumer awareness 
lastly  as appropriate we intend to make labeling improvements to our product as well as physical product enhancements to enhance the adoption of the essure procedure 
this may involve working with the various regulatory agencies around the world that regulate the sale and labeling of medical devices to provide updates to claims such as effectiveness and placement rates 
where appropriate  we will make physical improvements to the product for improved manufacturability or for the ease of use by the physician 
we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we will continue to expend substantial resources in the selling and marketing of the essure system in the united states and abroad 
due to the unpredictable nature of these activities  we do not know whether we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we will continue to be in a net loss position until sufficient revenues can be generated to offset expenses 
in december we filed a registration statement on form s  through which we may sell from time to time any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants  in one or more offerings  with an initial offering price not to exceed  in february  we completed a convertible debt offering for an aggregate principal amount of  of our convertible senior notes due in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we may need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
critical accounting estimates and policies we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligation  impairment of long lived assets  contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily comprised of the sale of our essure system 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulleting no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab under this standard  the following four criteria must be met in order to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the four revenue recognition criteria and other revenue related pronouncements are applied to our sales as described in the following paragraphs 
we recognize revenues from our essure system when we ship the device 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the system as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
we do not accept returns of the essure system 
we obtain written authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and the price is not dependent on actual essure procedures performed 
we have international distributors in france  australia and canada 
we recognize revenues upon shipment for sales through these distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
generally  our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  training and warranty for the sale of the essure device in their respective territories 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange the essure system and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of their ability to resell the product 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant from inception to date 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions shown in note of our notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the estimated life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  during the period ended december   we recorded stock based compensation for shares granted prior to  but not yet vested as of the adoption date based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original previsions of sfas no 
 and therefore  we did not restate previously reported amounts 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventory reserves are recorded when conditions indicate that the selling price may be less than the cost 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
once established  the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis 
reversal of these reserves is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
we have not experienced any significant write off of potentially excess and obsolete inventories in the past 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
as of december   and  our reserves were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  we account for the possibility that certain customers may not pay us by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   and  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately   and  respectively 
warranty obligation we provide for the estimated cost or our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change if we change manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractor 
should actual costs differ from historical experience  increases in warranty expense may be required 
warranty reserves as of december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment and the essure license acquired from a patent litigation settlement in see note to consolidated financial statements  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december   and included property and equipment of million  million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million  million and million  respectively 
contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we must assess whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at december  we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
due to our cumulative pre tax losses and the current uncertainty of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our deferred tax assets was recorded 
results of operations results compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended december  amount a amount a change net sales gross profit research development expenses selling  general administrative expenses net loss a expressed as a percentage of total net sales net sales net sales were million in  of which were from the united states  were from europe  and were from other regions 
net sales were million in  of which were from the united states  were from europe  and were from other regions 
the following table summarizes the above information related to net sales by geographic region in a tabular format years ended december  net sales in thousands united states of america europe other net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of our customers 
the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization of the essure system worldwide  and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure and higher utilization by trained physicians 
we also instituted a domestic price increase during the first quarter of as of december   the increase of physicians that have been trained or that are in the process of training has been commensurate with the increase in sales 
our accomplishment in obtaining the number of physicians trained is very important because it provides us with a strong referral base within major metropolitan areas we have targeted 
we understand that a strong base of trained physicians does not necessarily correlate to an increase in revenue proportionately 
furthermore  there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant to us from inception to date 
we expect to see higher sales of our essure system in as we continue to increase the number of sales representatives in order to provide even greater depth of physician coverage  which in turn we expect will increase physician utilization and the number of physicians performing the essure procedure in both the hospital and the office setting 
second  we will continue to increase our programs aimed at raising patient awareness of the essure procedure  such as advertising with physicians and internet marketing 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in gross profit increased million to million from million in our gross profit percentage was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit percentage improved throughout the year ended december  and was in the fourth quarter of  as compared to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of the impact of higher volumes on relatively fixed manufacturing costs  lower contractual prices from our third party manufacturer beginning in fiscal year and a domestic price increase instituted during the first quarter of we anticipate gross margins will improve throughout due to lower per unit costs on higher volume  however  our gross profit margin will vary as our sales mix changes 
increases in sales of our devices through distributors in international markets will tend to decrease our overall gross profit margin 
research and development research and development expenses  increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase results from million increase in stock based compensation due to the application of fas r and from expenditures related to product development  clinical affairs and regulatory activities 
our goal in research and development is to launch product enhancements over the coming years  which are intended to result in improved ease of use and clinical performance and lower cost of the essure system 
we expect to identify and hire additional research and development personnel in fiscal year to staff our planned research and development activities  and we expect that these costs will increase in the future in order to maintain our leading position in the market for permanent female birth control 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase results from higher payroll expenditures of million due to the expansion of our us field sales force in  which is meant to provide us with more selling time to focus on physician penetration 
additionally  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were a result of million in headcount increases in departments other than sales  million increase in stock based compensation due to the application of fas r  higher travel expenses of million  higher recruiting expenses of million  increase in depreciation and amortization of million and million in marketing programs and campaigns to increase physician education and patient awareness  partially offset by million in lower consulting services  million in lower legal and audit fees and million in lower rent expense 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we expect to hire additional sales professionals and to support patient awareness with increasing radio advertising 
other income and expenses interest and other income and expenses of million increased by million in compared to million in the increase is due to higher interest income in due to higher interest rates applied to the investments portfolio 
we expect higher interest income in as a result of investing the proceeds of our convertible senior note offering  completed in february  at a rate in excess of the coupon rate 
income taxes we have not recorded any income tax expense for and due to our recurring losses 
at december  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
at december  we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
due to our cumulative pre tax losses and the current uncertainty of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our deferred tax assets was recorded 
results compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended december  amount a amount a change net sales gross profit research development expenses selling  general administrative expenses net loss a expressed as a percentage of total net sales net sales net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe  and were from other regions 
net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe and were from other regions 
the following table summarizes the above information related to net sales by geographic region in tabular format years ended december  net sales in thousands united states of america europe other net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of the external customers 
the increase in net sales of million or was the result of continued commercialization of the essure system in the united states  where we have a higher price than our sales to our european distributor 
in early  we targeted groups of gynecological practices with the goal of training  inclusive of preceptorship 
as of december   the increase of physicians that have been trained or that are in the process of training has been commensurate with the increase in sales 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in gross profit increased in by million to million from million in our gross profit percentage was and for the years and  respectively 
our gross profit percentage was in the fourth quarter of  as compared to in the fourth quarter of and it increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of our domestic price increase and the transition of the manufacturing activities in to a third party manufacturer in mexico 
this outsourcing effort decreased our production costs and increased gross profit 
in april  we received fda approval for the process at the third party manufacturer 
operating expenses research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory and product development  increased by million to million in as compared to million in research and development expenditures fluctuate in relation to product development  clinical affairs and regulatory activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase resulted from higher expenditures in million for the expansion of our us field sales force by approximately sales representatives during  which was meant to provide us with more selling time to focus on physician penetration 
additionally  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were a result of million in headcount increase in departments other than sales  million for the accrual of bonuses for  million in the creation of a new department in sales  million in training programs  expenditures of million related to the move of our headquarters to new facilities located in mountain view  california  million in consulting fees for the development and enhancement of our internet website  million in legal expenditures  million in sales consulting and million in recruiting of new sales employees  offset by million in lower sales expenditures in australia  lower expenses of million in sales and training related to the termination of the agreement with gynecare  for the reduction of sarbanes oxley compliance and technology consulting fees and lower marketing expenses of million 
in addition  we had limited international expenditures in  since we completed the divestiture of our french subsidiary in january and the closure of our direct operations in australia in january from the latter  all severance costs were completely paid out at the end of january other income and expenses interest and other income and expenses of million increased by million in compared to million in the increase was due to higher interest income in due to higher interest rates applied to the investments portfolio 
income taxes as a result of our net loss of million  we incurred no income tax expense in as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december   we had federal and state research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization and in the event we have had a change of ownership  utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which is a change in accounting for income taxes 
fin specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and as a result  is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
states that registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement 
the interpretations in sab no 
contain guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach  as well as provide transition guidance for correcting errors 
this interpretation does not change the requirements within sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and fasb statement no 
for the correction of an error on financial statements
