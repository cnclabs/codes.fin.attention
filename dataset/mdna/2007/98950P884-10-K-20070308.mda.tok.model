item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe that we are the first company dedicated solely to developing the full spectrum of next generation access network solutions to cost effectively deliver high bandwidth services while simultaneously preserving the investment in today s networks 
our next generation solutions are based upon our single line multi service  or slms  architecture 
from its inception  this slms architecture was specifically designed for the delivery of multiple classes of subscriber services such as voice  data and video distribution  rather than being based on a particular protocol or media 
in other words  our slms products are built to support the migration from legacy circuit to packet technologies and from copper to fiber technologies 
this flexibility and versatility allows our products to adapt to future technologies while allowing service providers to focus on the delivery of additional high bandwidth services 
because this slms architecture is designed to interoperate with existing legacy equipment  service providers can leverage their existing networks to deliver a combination of voice  data and video services today  while they migrate  either simultaneously or at a future date  from legacy equipment to next generation equipment with minimal interruption 
we believe that our slms solution provides an evolutionary path for service providers from their existing infrastructures  as well as gives newer service providers the capability to deploy cost effective  multi service networks that can support voice  data and video 
our product offerings fall within three categories the slms product family  optical transport products  and legacy products and services 
our global customer base includes regional  national and international telecommunications carriers  as well as cable service providers 
to date  our products are deployed by over network service providers on six continents worldwide  including two of the top three cable operators in north america 
we believe that we have assembled the employee base  technological breadth and market presence to provide a simple yet comprehensive set of next generation solutions to the bandwidth bottleneck in the access network and the other problems encountered by network service providers when delivering communications services to subscribers 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  during the third quarter of  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million related to goodwill and acquired intangibles 
the primary circumstance leading to the impairment was a decline in our projected revenue due to technology transition issues with our largest international customers and a resulting decline in our market capitalization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
going forward  our key financial objectives include the following increasing revenue while continuing to carefully control costs  continued investments in strategic research and product development activities that will provide the maximum potential return on investment  and minimizing consumption of our cash and short term investments 
acquisitions since inception  we have successfully utilized a strategy of acquisitions to acquire customers  technology and build scale within the network access markets 
as of december   we had completed twelve acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies to supplement our internal growth 
to date  we have generated a significant amount of our revenue from sales of products obtained through acquisitions 
some of the more significant acquisitions have included paradyne networks  inc in september  sorrento networks corporation in july  and tellium inc in november 
table of contents if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  we could consume cash  incur substantial additional debt and other liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large write offs related to impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
in addition  future acquisitions may have a significant impact on our short term results of operations  materially impacting revenues or expenses and making period to period comparisons of our results of operations less meaningful 
on september   we completed the acquisition of paradyne in exchange for total consideration of million  consisting of common stock valued at million  options and warrants to purchase common stock valued at million  and acquisition costs of million 
we acquired paradyne to strengthen our position as a leading provider of next generation access network solutions as well as increase our customer base 
the purchase consideration was allocated to the fair values of the assets acquired as follows net tangible assets million  amortizable intangible assets million  purchased in process research and development million  goodwill million  and deferred compensation million 
the amount allocated to purchased in process research and development was charged to expense during the third quarter of because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses for the technology existed 
the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow model  based on a discount rate which took into consideration the stage of completion and risks associated with developing the technology 
of the amount allocated to amortizable intangible assets million was allocated to core technology and million was allocated to patents  both of which were assigned an estimated life of five years 
in addition  million was allocated to backlog and million was allocated to customer relationships  which were assigned estimated lives of six months and seven years  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because changes in such estimates can materially affect the amount of our reported net income or loss 
for all of these policies  management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment of product under contractual terms which transfer title to customers upon shipment  under normal credit terms  or under sales type leases  net of estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue is deferred if there are significant post delivery obligations  if collection is not considered reasonably assured at the time of sale  or if the fees are not fixed or determinable 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
our arrangements generally do not have any significant post delivery obligations 
we offer products and services such as support  education and training  hardware upgrades and post warranty support 
for multiple element revenue arrangements  we establish the fair value of these products and services based primarily on sales prices when the products and services are sold separately 
if fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements  all of the revenue under the arrangement is deferred until those elements have been delivered 
when collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when cash is collected 
revenue from education services and support services is recognized over the contract term or as the service is performed 
we make certain sales to product distributors 
these customers are given certain privileges to return a portion of inventory 
return privileges generally allow distributors to return inventory based on a percent of purchases made within a specific period of time 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors that have contractual return rights when the products have been sold by the distributors  unless there 
table of contents is sufficient customer specific sales and sales returns history to support revenue recognition upon shipment 
in those instances when shipments made to distributors are recognized upon shipment of the products from the factory  we use historical rates of return from the distributors to provide for estimated product returns in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue from sales of software products is recognized provided that a purchase order has been received  the software has been shipped  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and the amount of the related fees is fixed or determinable 
to date  revenue from software transactions and sales type leases has not been significant 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience and expected future costs 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts we record an allowance for sales returns for estimated future product returns related to current period product revenue 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and an allowance against our accounts receivable 
we base our allowance for sales returns on periodic assessments of historical trends in product return rates and current approved returned products 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments for amounts owed to us 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our allowance on periodic assessments of our customers liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
additional allowances may be required in the future if the liquidity or financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets our long lived assets have consisted primarily of goodwill  other acquisition related intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment using a two step approach  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets based on a combination of the market  income and replacement cost approaches 
in the application of the impairment testing  we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and million of net property and equipment 
our future operating performance will be impacted by potential charges related to purchased in process research and development for future acquisitions  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  we would have to perform an impairment review that might result in impairment of the goodwill 
other factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review  include  but are not limited to  significant changes in the manner of use of our acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends  such as stock price movements 
for example  during and  we determined that such indicators of impairment existed  resulting in an impairment charge to goodwill and 
table of contents amortizable intangibles of million and million  respectively 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill may change in the future  which could result in additional non cash impairment charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
stock based compensation in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we adopted the modified prospective method of transition under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
we have estimated the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change  and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net loss and net loss per share 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
fair value stock based compensation expense under sfas r for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the provisions of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all employee share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized compensation cost for stock options issued or assumed through acquisitions  based on the intrinsic value  which represents the difference between the exercise price of each stock option granted or assumed and the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the grant date or consummation date of the business combination 
the resulting deferred stock compensation was amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was recorded for options issued to non employees 
these options are generally immediately exercisable and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
we value non employee options using the black scholes model 
non employee options subject to vesting are valued as they become vested 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in addition  we have reclassified prior years stock based compensation expense to the associated operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations in order to conform to the current year presentation 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
in assessing the net realizable value of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value cannot be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
to the extent that a severe decline in forecasted demand occurs  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may incur significant charges for excess inventory

table of contents information about our revenue by product line for and is summarized below in millions increase decrease change slms optical transport legacy and service total revenue increased or million to million for compared to million for the increase in total revenue was due to incremental revenue from the acquisition of paradyne in september  offset by lower sales of our optical and legacy products 
additionally  we experienced increased demand for our slms products compared to the prior year  particularly in the international territories 
in  product revenue increased or million and service revenue remained consistent with an increase of or million compared to service revenue represents revenue from maintenance and other services associated with product shipments 
the increase in both product and service revenue was due to incremental revenue from the paradyne acquisition and increased demand for our slms products 
international revenue increased or million to million in and represented of total revenue compared with in the significant increase in international revenue represents the increasing opportunity for our next generation products in both existing and new network deployments among emerging international carriers in the middle east and latin america  as well as incremental revenue from paradyne products 
while we have experienced significant growth in international markets  we have recently encountered price focused competitors and we anticipate this will continue as we invest in expanding markets 
by product family  revenue for our slms product family increased million or in compared to due to the incremental revenue associated with paradyne s broadband products 
revenue also increased due to increased adoption of iptv  voip and broadband services  creating increased demand for our slms products  particularly in international territories 
revenue for our legacy products and services decreased million or in  supporting the growing shift from legacy technologies to our growing slms business 
additionally  we continue to divest non strategic legacy products in order to focus our efforts on our slms product family 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to divest our imarc legacy product line  and in we divested our meret  sechtor  arca dacs and eluminant legacy products 
the decrease in legacy products was partially offset by incremental revenue from paradyne service and narrowband products acquired in september optical transport decreased million or in compared to this decreased demand reflects continued fluctuation as a result of significant customer concentration within this product category 
we expect that the product mix will continue to shift toward next generation products in slms 
while no customer accounted for or more of net revenue in or  sales to one customer represented of net revenue in we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period may depend to a large extent on sales to a small number of large accounts 
as a result  our revenue for any quarter may be subject to significant volatility based upon changes in orders from one or a small number of key customers 
cost of revenue and gross profit total cost of revenue  including stock based compensation  increased million  or to million for  compared to million for total cost of revenue was of revenue for  compared to of revenue for the increase in cost of revenues for compared to 
table of contents includes a million write off of inventory related to reduced demand of legacy products during the second quarter of and additional stock based compensation of million related to the implementation of sfas r in january in addition  included a net benefit of approximately million related to several infrequent transactions  including a benefit related to the sale of non strategic products and a favorable settlement with a contract manufacturer  offset by charges for discontinued inventory resulting from integration efforts related to the paradyne acquisition and other charges related to vendor and customer claims 
overall  gross profit also decreased due to the lack of operating leverage on fixed manufacturing costs at lower than anticipated revenue levels as well as lower pricing for strategic international customers 
we expect that  in the future  our cost of revenue will also vary as a percentage of net revenue depending on the mix and average selling prices of products sold 
in addition  competitive and economic pressures could cause us to reduce our prices  adjust the carrying values of our inventory  or record inventory charges relating to discontinued products and excess or obsolete inventory 
research and product development expenses research and product development expenses increased or million to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increased investment in research and development and personnel related costs to support development enhancements to our existing products and our new next generation technologies  as well as development support for our acquired technologies 
we intend to continue to invest in research and product development to attain our strategic product development objectives  while seeking to manage the associated costs through expense controls 
additionally  for the year ended december   approximately million of stock based compensation expense was included in research and product development expenses  compared to only million during the year ended december   primarily due to the implementation of sfas r in january sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased or million to million for compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher commissions and other personnel related costs to support revenue growth  particularly in the international territories  as well as increased spending on trade shows  travel and other marketing related promotions 
additionally  for the year ended december   approximately million of stock based compensation expense was included in sales and marketing expenses  compared to only million during the year ended december   primarily due to the implementation of sfas r in january general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased or million to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to non recurring charges associated with the paradyne acquisition in the prior year offset by increased costs to support a larger organization as a result of the paradyne acquisition and higher bad debt associated with a customer bankruptcy in the first quarter of compared to a debt recovery in the prior year 
additionally  for the year ended december   approximately million of stock based compensation expense was included in general and administrative expenses primarily due to the implementation of sfas r  compared to million during the year ended december   related to options granted to non employees for services received in conjunction with the paradyne acquisition

during the third quarter of  we determined that indicators of impairment existed as we experienced an adverse change in our business as evidenced by a decline in our projected revenue due to technology transition issues with our largest international customers  and a resulting decline in our market capitalization 
we performed an impairment analysis which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million as the fair value of our reporting unit was less than book value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
we also recorded a non cash impairment charge for other intangible assets of million  which represented the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeded the fair value 
the impairment charge in related to the impairment of goodwill of million and acquired intangibles of million 
the primary circumstance leading to the impairment of intangibles was a decline in our projected future cash flows associated with technology and other intangibles acquired from our prior acquisitions 
the impairment reflects a more rapid decline in projected revenue from certain legacy products than previously anticipated as customers transition to next generation products 
interest expense interest expense for decreased by million to million compared to due primarily to a decrease in the outstanding debt balances 
interest income interest income for increased by million to million due to higher average balances of cash and short term investments 
other income expense  net other income was million for compared to other expense of million for the change was primarily due to exchange gains on foreign currencies in the current year compared to exchange losses in the prior year 
we transact business in various foreign countries and are exposed to currency exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
income tax provision during the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million and million  respectively  related to foreign and state taxes 
no deferred tax benefit was recorded due to our operating losses and net operating loss carryforwards 
due to the significant uncertainty regarding the realization of our net deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance was recorded

table of contents impairment of intangible assets and goodwill impairment of intangible assets and goodwill increased million to million for compared to million for the increase was attributable to the impairment of goodwill of million and impairment of acquired intangibles of million 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge as the fair value of our reporting unit  based on the market approach  was less than book value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we also recorded a non cash impairment charge for purchased intangibles which represented the amount by which the carrying value of the purchased intangibles exceeded the fair value 
the primary circumstance leading to the impairment of intangibles was a decline in our projected future cash flows associated with technology and other intangibles acquired from our prior acquisitions 
the impairment reflects a more rapid decline in projected revenue from certain legacy products than previously anticipated as customers transition to next generation products 
the impairment charge in related to impairment of acquired workforce from an acquisition as the majority of those employees were no longer employed by us

income tax provision during the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million related to foreign and state taxes 
no deferred tax benefit was recorded due to our operating losses and net operating loss carryforwards 
due to the significant uncertainty regarding the realization of our net deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance was recorded 
liquidity and capital resources our operations are financed through a combination of our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  available credit facilities  and sales of equity and debt instruments  based on our operating requirements and market conditions 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared to million at december  total debt was million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million was attributable to net cash used in operating activities of million  offset by net cash provided by investing activities of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million 

table of contents operating activities net cash used in operating activities consisted of the net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges totaling million and changes in operating assets and liabilities totaling million 
the most significant components of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a decrease in accrued expenses of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million  offset by a decrease in inventories of million 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of cash acquired through the net sale of short term investments of million and proceeds from the sale of patents and marketable securities of million  offset by capital equipment purchases of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and proceeds from the repayment of officer loans of million  offset by the repayment of debt of million primarily associated with a voluntary repayment of million of debenture debt  million repayment of a note payable and million of other principal debt payments on our secured real estate loan 
cash management our primary source of liquidity comes from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  which totaled million at december   and our million line of credit  under which million was outstanding at december  and an additional million was committed as security for obligations under various letters of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the financial institution s prime rate or libor plus  at our election  provided that the minimum interest rate is 
the interest rate was at december  our short term investments are classified as available for sale and consist of securities that are readily convertible to cash  including certificates of deposits  commercial paper and government securities  with original maturities at the date of acquisition ranging from days to one year 
at current revenue levels  we anticipate that some portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will continue to be consumed by operations 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represents a concentration of credit risk because a significant portion of the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of a relatively small number of customer account balances from companies in the telecommunications industry 
during the first quarter of  we entered into an amendment to our existing million revolving credit facility and accounts receivable purchase facility with silicon valley bank the svb facilities providing for a one year extension of the term of the svb facilities 
under the svb facilities  as amended  we have the option of either borrowing funds at agreed upon rates of interest or selling specific accounts receivable to silicon valley bank  on a limited recourse basis  at agreed upon discounts to the face amount of those accounts receivable  so long as the aggregate amount of outstanding borrowings and the aggregate amount of our repurchase obligations with respect to purchased accounts receivable do not exceed million 
the amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility will bear interest  payable monthly  at a floating rate that  at our option  is either silicon valley bank s prime rate  or the sum of the libor rate plus  provided that in either case  the minimum interest rate is 
our obligations under the svb facilities remain secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries  including our intellectual property 
the svb facilities contain certain financial covenants  and customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants 
future requirements and funding sources our fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases  inventory purchase commitments  and payments of principal and interest for debt obligations 
our current debt 
table of contents obligations include million in convertible debenture debt that will become due  and is expected to be paid  in august in addition  as a result of the paradyne acquisition  we assumed a lease commitment for facilities in largo  florida 
the term of the lease expires in june and had an estimated remaining obligation of approximately million as of december  we intend to continue to occupy only a portion of these facilities and are evaluating our options to exit the excess portion of the lease 
we have recorded million as of december  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf  which we believe is adequate to cover costs incurred to exit the excess portion of these facilities 
as a result of the financial demands of major network deployments and the difficulty in accessing capital markets  network service providers continue to request financing assistance from their suppliers 
from time to time  we may provide or commit to extend credit or credit support to our customers 
this financing may include extending credit to customers or guaranteeing the indebtedness of customers to third parties 
depending upon market conditions  we may seek to factor these arrangements to financial institutions and investors to reduce the amount of our financial commitments associated with such arrangements 
for example  during the year ended december   we sold million of customer receivables to financial institutions on a non recourse basis 
our ability to provide customer financing is limited and depends upon a number of factors  including our capital structure  the level of our available credit and our ability to factor commitments to third parties 
any extension of financing to our customers will limit the capital that we have available for other uses 
as of december   we did not have any significant customer financing commitments or guarantees 
in march  we filed a form s registration statement which allows us to sell  from time to time  up to million of our common stock or other securities 
although we may use this multi purpose shelf registration to raise additional capital  there can be no certainty as to when or if we may offer any securities under the shelf registration or what the terms of any such offering would be 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and available credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require additional funds if our revenues or expenses fail to meet our current projections or to support other purposes and may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurances that additional funding will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  consist of obligations under operating leases  line of credit  debt and inventory purchase commitments 
refer to note and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  for more detailed information 
at december   our estimated future contractual commitments by fiscal year were as follows in thousands payments due by period total and beyond operating leases line of credit debt inventory purchase commitments total leases the operating lease amounts shown above represent off balance sheet arrangements to the extent that a liability is not already recorded on our balance sheet 
for operating lease commitments  a liability is generally not recorded on our balance sheet unless the facility represents an excess facility for which an estimate of the facility 
table of contents exit costs has been recorded on our balance sheet 
for operating leases that include contractual commitments for operating expenses and maintenance  estimates of such amounts are included based on current rates 
payments made under operating leases will be treated as rent expense for the facilities currently being utilized 
line of credit and debt the debt and line of credit obligations have been recorded on our balance sheet 
the debt obligation amounts shown above represent the scheduled principal repayments  but not the associated interest payments which may vary based on changes in market interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash  cash equivalents and investments we consider all cash and highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following as of december  and in thousands december  december  cash money market funds commercial paper us agency securities cash and cash equivalents short term investments concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of demand deposit and money market accounts  commercial paper and debt securities of domestic municipalities with credit ratings of aa or better 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are principally held with various domestic financial institutions with high credit standing 
for the year ended december   sales to one customer represented of net revenue 
no other customer accounted for or more of net revenue in  or as of december  and  no customer accounted for or more of accounts receivable 
as of december  and  receivables from customers in international territories represented and  respectively  of accounts receivable 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are not subject to material interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
under our investment policy  short term investments have a maximum maturity of one year from the date of acquisition  and the average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed six months 
due to the relatively short maturity of the portfolio  a increase in market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by less than million 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
substantially all of our assets are located in the united states 
we have sales operations throughout europe  asia  the middle east and latin america 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
accordingly  our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies 
during and  we did not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure 
we have performed sensitivity analyses as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially
