overview the company designs  develops and markets athletic footwear for high performance sports use  fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand  and also designs and manufactures footwear under the royal elastics brand 
royal elastics is our wholly owned subsidiary 
the categories of footwear we sell are explained in more detail in item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products in the united states through our sales executives and independent sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores 
we also sell our products through our website and internationally through company sales managers  independent sales representatives and a number of foreign distributors 
in  approximately of our footwear products were manufactured in china 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements  but we believe that our relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we will have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues decreased in from  due to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold offset by an increase in the average underlying wholesale price  and our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses also increased to of revenues in from of revenues in at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  a decrease of from the comparable period of the prior year 
of this amount  domestic futures orders were  a decrease of  and international futures orders were  an increase of 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we recognize that the athletic footwear industry is highly competitive 
several makers of footwear have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources as well as greater brand awareness than us 
in  our largest single marketing expenditure was television 
our marketing campaign was run mainly on network and cable television  and was supported by sports  music and general interest fashion magazines 
our independent sales representatives sold to approximately  separate accounts as of december  down from  as of december  
internationally  by the end of  we were working through international subsidiaries and distributors to market our products in potentially countries 
also  during  the foot locker group of stores and its affiliates accounted for approximately of total revenues 

table of contents in  we had a net cash inflow of approximately  from operating activities and a net cash outflow of  from investing activities due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future growth  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
there was no debt outstanding at december  and and our working capital increased  to approximately  at december  from  at december  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer according to the terms of the order 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and allowances as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances and specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivables and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to 
table of contents make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and historical level of credit losses  as well as an assessment of the overall conditions at retail 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional charge to cost of sales 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
also  at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings 
we have not recorded united states income tax expense for earnings on certain subsidiary companies that we have declared to be permanently invested  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as permanently invested is based upon our expectations of the future cash needs of our subsidiaries 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of earnings to be permanently invested 
because the declaration involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as permanently invested may ultimately be repatriated 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer permanently invested 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full calendar year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to estimated pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  to determine the estimated year to date and quarterly tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the quarterly period in which they occur 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date income tax provision equals the estimated annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed 
table of contents the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of certain items in the consolidated statements of earnings relative to revenues

table of contents customer acceptance of our domestic product has been weak and is likely to continue for the near term 
we have recently hired several individuals in product design and management  however  it will take additional time for the full impact of the contribution of these individuals to affect our business 
we believe the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased domestic sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday season 
we present full line offerings for the easter and back to school seasons  for delivery during the first and third quarters  respectively  but not for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  lower and higher  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were in and in gross profit margin for was affected by product mix changes  international sales becoming a larger portion of revenues and changes in our at once business

selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  was the result of increases in legal  compensation and warehousing expenses offset by a decrease in advertising expenses 
legal expenses increased in connection with pursuing a lawsuit to protect our trademarks 
compensation expenses  which includes commissions  bonus incentive related expenses and employee recruiting and relocation expenses  increased primarily due to recognizing compensation expenses related to stock options as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised and an increase in headcount offset by a decrease in bonus incentive related expenses that were calculated in accordance with our bonus formula under our economic value added eva incentive program 
warehousing expenses  other than compensation and compensation related expenses  increased primarily as a result of higher freight and supply costs 
advertising expenses decreased  primarily due to a decrease in domestic advertising expenses from an effort to reduce costs as a result of declining domestic revenues offset by an increase in our international advertising expenses as part of a strategic effort to drive higher revenues 
corporate expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in corporate expenses during the year ended december  was due to an increase in legal expenses  as explained above 
adoption of sfas no 
revised on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
in accordance with sfas no 
revised  we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
we 
table of contents determine the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of these options 
for the year ended december   we recognized  in compensation costs 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no

starting january   provision has not been made for united states income taxes on earnings of selected international subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly due to our geographic mix of sales  as international sales have become a larger portion of revenues  with these subsidiaries being profitable and to an increase in our tax exempt interest income

sab no 
addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no

sab no 
also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented

 we have adjusted beginning retained earnings for the year ended december  by  penalties are discretionary  ranging from zero to of the taxes owed  and at this time we cannot determine the likelihood of such assessment and have not recognized penalties related to this issue 
however  there can be no guarantee that penalties will not be imposed

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and between the euro and pound sterling 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose us to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
our primary risk exposures are from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro and between the euro and pound sterling 
in and  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars and pounds sterling for euros 
the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to occur in less than one year 
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally require us to exchange euros for us dollars or pounds sterling for euros at maturity  at rates agreed at the inception of the contracts 
the counterparty to derivative transactions is a major financial institution with an investment grade or better credit rating  however  we are exposed to credit risk with this institution 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should this counterparty fail to perform as contracted 
at december   forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  were outstanding to exchange various currencies with maturities ranging from january to august  to sell the equivalent of approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates and to buy  at contracted rates 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   assets of  and liabilities of  have been recorded for the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts 
realized losses of  and  and realized gains of  from cash flow hedges were recorded in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  respectively 
realized gains of   and  from cash flow hedges were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses due to hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations or financial position relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have had a material effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term borrowings on our working capital lines of credit 
a change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses  without a significant loss in sales 
accordingly  to date  inflation and changing prices have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues or earnings
