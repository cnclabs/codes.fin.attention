introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary collectively  ipc are discussed 
idacorp is a holding company formed in whose principal operating subsidiary is ipc 
idacorp is subject to the provisions of the public utility holding company act of  which provides certain access to books and records to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and state utility regulatory commissions and imposes certain record retention and reporting requirements on idacorp 

table of contents ipc is an electric utility with a service territory covering approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
ipc is regulated by the ferc and the state regulatory commissions of idaho and oregon 
ipc is the parent of idaho energy resources co  a joint venturer in bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by ipc 
idacorp s other subsidiaries include idacorp financial services  inc ifs  an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments  ida west energy company ida west  an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  and idacorp energy ie  a marketer of energy commodities  which wound down operations in in the second quarter of  idacorp management designated the operations of idacorp technologies  inc iti and idacomm as assets held for sale  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no

executive overview financial results idacorp s earnings for the year were million  up million as compared to diluted earnings per share were  an increase of per share as compared to the key components of the change in idacorp s net income are ipc s earnings increased to million  a million or per diluted share increase over the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to customer growth and increased electricity sales contributed million net of tax to earnings 
ipc continued to experience strong customer growth  gaining  new customers in  an increase of percent 
the increase in electricity sales was primarily a result of record electricity demand during an unusually warm period in may  june  and july 
improved operating margins revenues less net power supply costs contributed million net of tax to earnings  largely as a result of improved hydroelectric generating conditions and a net base rate increase of percent on june  percent base rate increase effective june   less a one time base rate increase of percent related to a rate case tax settlement that expired on the same date 
improved stream flow conditions increased total system generation 
ipc s hydroelectric generation contributed percent of total system generation for  as compared to percent for  and was percent higher than generation in 
table of contents o m expenses reduced earnings by million net of tax compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to higher labor related expenses resulting from general wage adjustments and attainment of performance targets  higher thermal o m due to aging thermal plant and equipment and unanticipated outages at the valmy plant  and increases in other o m items associated with higher levels of electricity generation  distribution and customer service efforts 
income tax expense at ipc was flat year over year 
higher earnings before tax increased tax expense by million but was offset by a net million tax benefit that resulted from the settlement of all non a uniform capitalization issues from the irs exam 
the effective tax rates for and were percent and percent  respectively 
excluding the settlement  ipc s tax rates for and would have been substantially the same 
in  management designated the operations of iti and idacomm as assets held for sale and presented the operations of these entities as discontinued operations on idacorp s financial statements 
discontinued operations contributed million to earnings in as compared to a loss of million in the prior year  an increase of per diluted share 
the improvement was primarily due to a gain on disposal of iti of million  net of tax  or per diluted share 
the earnings increase is also attributable to lower operating expenses resulting from the sale of iti in july and the phase out of the broadband over power line business at idacomm during the first half of a million goodwill impairment recorded at idacomm during also impacted the results 
earnings at ie decreased from million in to zero in  a decrease of per diluted share 
since  ie has had no operations but has been working to settle outstanding legal actions related to transactions in the california energy markets in and the major transaction affecting results in was an adjustment to an allowance for uncollectible accounts due from california parties in the california refund proceedings 
net loss at the holding company increased million to million as compared to the prior year  or per diluted share 
the increase in net loss is attributable to higher legal expenses and higher labor related and stock based compensation expenses 
ifs contributed million less to earnings than in the prior year  a decrease of per diluted share 
the decline in earnings is attributable to higher investment amortization expense and lower tax benefits due to continued aging of investments 
idacorp s income tax expense increased million as a result of higher earnings moderated by the offset by the benefit from the irs exam settlement 
business strategy idacorp is focusing on a strategy that emphasizes ipc as idacorp s core business 
ipc continues to experience strong customer growth in its service area  and this corporate strategy recognizes that ipc must make substantial investments in infrastructure to ensure adequate supply and reliable service 
ifs and ida west remain components of the corporate strategy 
the strategy includes seeking timely rate relief in both the idaho and oregon jurisdictions 
ipc plans to file in idaho and oregon for either asset specific or general rate relief regularly in upcoming years the strategy also includes idacorp s sale of non core businesses 
idacorp completed the sale of iti on july   and completed the sale of idacomm on february  regulatory matters general rate case settlement on june   ipc implemented a percent million annual increase to its idaho retail base rates 
ipc had filed a general rate case with the ipuc in october  and the ipuc approved a settlement agreement in may base rates primarily reflect ipc s cost of providing electrical service to its customers  including equipment  vehicles and infrastructure 
ipc s overall allowed rate of return in idaho increased from percent to percent 

table of contents power cost adjustment on june   ipc implemented its annual power cost adjustment pca  resulting in a million reduction in the rates of idaho customers 
the reduction in rates comes as a direct benefit of the above average snow pack in the mountains upstream of brownlee reservoir and lower than forecasted power supply costs in the pca year 
in years when water is plentiful and ipc can fully utilize its extensive hydroelectric system  power production costs are lower and ipc can pass those benefits to its customers in the form of rate reductions 
when water is in short supply  as it was from through  the higher costs of supplying power by other means also are shared with ipc s customers 
emission allowances in and early  ipc sold  so emission allowances for approximately million before income taxes and expenses on the open market 
after subtracting transaction fees  the total amount of sales proceeds to be allocated to the idaho jurisdiction is approximately million million net of tax  assuming a tax rate of approximately percent 
through allowance year  ipc has approximately  excess allowances 
pursuant to the ipuc order  ipc retained percent or approximately million after tax of the emission allowance net proceeds as a shareholder benefit 
the remaining percent of the sales proceeds million is to be recorded as a customer benefit and included in the pca true up 
a carrying charge will be calculated on million  the net of tax amount allocable to idaho jurisdiction customers 
this customer benefit will be reflected in pca rates during the june  through may  pca rate year 
a stipulation is currently before the opuc which would offset so emission allowance proceeds against the balance of oregon deferred power supply cost 
load growth adjustment rate ipc filed a petition with the ipuc in april requesting modification of one component of its pca referred to as the load growth adjustment rate lgar 
the lgar subtracts the cost of serving new idaho retail customers from the power supply costs ipc is allowed to include in its pca 
the lgar was set at per mwh when the pca began in this amount was established as the projected marginal cost of serving each new customer and is subtracted from each year s pca expense 
on january   the ipuc issued its final order in this matter 
the ipuc maintained the marginal cost methodology and set the new lgar at per mwh 
the new rate becomes effective on april  and will first affect customer rates on june  the impact of the new lgar on ipc will ultimately be determined by future load growth 
assuming an average mw load growth  the new rate would result in approximately million being subtracted from the next pca  a pre tax increase of million over the current amount 
the impact of the new lgar can be partially offset by ipc through more frequent general rate case filings with the ipuc or from less customer growth 
in its order the ipuc stated that it expected ipc to update its load growth adjustment in all future general rate cases 
irs audit proceedings on october   the internal revenue service issued its examination report and assessment for idacorp s tax years 
the irs and idacorp were able to settle all issues  with the exception of ipc s capitalized overhead cost method 
the federal tax assessment for the settled issues was paid in november and did not have a material impact on idacorp s cash flows 
the settlement decreased idacorp s income tax expense by million as the assessed deficiency was less than the amounts previously accrued 
the disallowance of ipc s capitalized overhead cost method for uniform capitalization the simplified service cost method resulted in a federal tax assessment of million 
idacorp disagrees with this conclusion and has appealed the issue 
in november  idacorp filed its formal protest  made a refundable deposit of the disputed tax with the irs to stop the accrual of interest  and requested an appeals conference 
management cannot predict the timing or outcome of this process  but believes that an adequate provision for income taxes and related interest charges has been made for this issue see income taxes for a more detailed discussion 

table of contents high temperatures ipc s service territory  along with much of the western united states  experienced above normal temperatures during the months of may  june and july new records were set for cooling degree days  a measure of temperature impact on customer demand 
due to these above normal conditions  a new system peak of  mw was first set on june   and was subsequently surpassed on july   when a new system peak of  mw was recorded 
since june   the previous system peak of  mw  which was set in  was met or exceeded times 
ipc was able to meet all of its load requirements during these periods of increased demand through its system generation and by increasing the amount of its purchased power 
integrated resource plan the irp is prepared and filed every two years with the ipuc and the opuc 
prior to filing  the irp requires extensive involvement by ipc  the ipuc staff  the opuc staff  and customer and environmental representatives  as well as input on the cost of various generation technologies 
the irp is the starting point for demonstrating prudence in ipc s resource decisions 
the irp identified ipc s forecast load and resource situation for the next twenty years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
the two primary goals of the irp were to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy service within ipc s service area throughout the year planning period and ensure that the portfolio of resources selected balances cost  risk and environmental concerns 
in addition  there were four secondary goals to give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures  to involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way  explore transmission alternatives  and investigate and evaluate advanced coal technologies 
the irp was submitted to the ipuc in september and the opuc in october a hearing has been set in oregon for june capital requirements and cash flows idacorp estimates that it will spend million on construction expenditures over the next three years 
this amount reflects the need for additional resources in order for ipc to supply power to its growing number of customers 
forecasts indicate that internal cash generation after dividends will provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and continued reliance on externally financed capital 
the amount of internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs and provide a return on investment 
idaho water management issues power generation at the ipc hydroelectric power plants on the snake river is dependent upon the state water rights held by ipc and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
ipc continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources 
this includes active participation in the snake river basin adjudication  a judicial action initiated in to determine the nature and extent of water use in the snake river basin  judicial and administrative proceedings relating to the conjunctive management of ground and surface water rights  and management and planning processes intended to reverse declining trends in river  spring  and aquifer levels and address the long term water resource needs of the state 
while none of the pending water management issues are expected to impact ipc s hydroelectric generation in the near term  ipc s ongoing participation in such issues will help ensure that water remains available over the long term for use at ipc s hydropower projects on the snake river 
critical accounting policies and estimates idacorp s and ipc s discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations are based upon their consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires idacorp and ipc to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  idacorp and ipc evaluate these estimates  including those related to rate regulation  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation  asset impairment  income taxes  unbilled revenues and bad debt 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
idacorp and ipc  based on their ongoing reviews  will make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 

table of contents idacorp and ipc believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for rate regulation a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary effect of this policy is that ipc has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets and return these regulatory liabilities  such recovery is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if ipc should determine in the future that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas  it would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
in the event of deregulation  ipc intends to seek recovery of all of its prudent costs  including stranded costs 
due to the current lack of definitive legislation  ipc cannot predict whether recovery would be successful 
if ipc has to write off a material amount of the regulatory assets  it will have a material adverse effect on ipc s results of operations and financial position 
pension expense ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees and an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors 
the expenses idacorp and ipc record for these plans depend on a number of factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations upon which pension expense is based 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors are used to develop the actuarial assumptions and are extremely uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and ipc utilize data published in the citigroup pension liability index and apply the rates therein against the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be increased to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current low interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 

table of contents pension expense for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor costs 
for  pension expense is expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the increase in the discount rate noted above 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were made to the qualified plan in through  and none are expected in under the non qualified plan  ipc makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
payments averaged approximately million per year from to  and a similar amount is anticipated in please refer to note of idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about the pension plans 
contingent liabilities there are a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory  legal and tax matters 
contingent liabilities are provided for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies not meeting both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
the companies have made estimates of the ultimate resolution of all such matters  based on the facts and circumstances  opinions of legal counsel and other factors 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
long lived assets that were evaluated in include the following grid west development costs in response to ferc order no 
issued in  several northwest utilities  including ipc  attempted formation of a regional transmission organization called rto west  which eventually evolved into grid west 
ipc had recorded million of loans to grid west and million of deferred internal costs from participating in the development effort 
ipc s deferral of development costs was consistent with a accounting order that ipc received from the ferc 
these amounts were initially deferred anticipating future recovery through grid west tariffs 
grid west was dissolved on april  and ipc no longer expects reimbursement of either amount from grid west 
ipc filed requests with the ipuc and opuc to recover grid west costs 
the ipuc and opuc denied recovery of the deferred internal costs  and in the fourth quarter of  ipc wrote off million of the deferred costs 
the remaining million of ferc related costs were reclassified to regulatory assets in anticipation of recovery from the ferc in future periods 

table of contents southwest intertie project ipc began developing the southwest intertie project swip in ipc s investment consists predominantly of a federal permit for a specific transmission corridor in nevada and idaho and also private rights of way in idaho 
the swip rights of way extend from midpoint substation in south central idaho through eastern nevada to the dry lake area northeast of las vegas  nevada 
in the bureau of land management granted a five year extension to begin construction of a proposed kv transmission line within the rights of way before december on march  ipc entered into an agreement with white pine energy associates  llc white pine  an affiliate of ls power development  llc  which provides white pine a three year exclusive option to purchase the swip rights of way from ipc 
the option may be exercised in part or as a whole and  if fully exercised  will result in a net pre tax gain to ipc of approximately million 
based on management expectations regarding swip  no impairment has been identified 
impairment of equity method investments ifs has affordable housing investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for two investments now consolidated in accordance with gaap these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded under apb is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
impairment analyses on these investments were performed in and no impairment was noted 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
unbilled revenue ipc s retail revenues include an estimate of electricity delivered that has not been billed at the end of the period 
unbilled revenues estimates are dependent upon a number of inputs that require management s judgment 
unbilled revenue is calculated by taking daily estimates of mwhs delivered and applying information from the meter reading schedule to estimate the portion of mwhs delivered that have not been billed 
these unbilled mwhs are then allocated to the retail customer classes based on historical usage by each class 
ipc then records revenue for each customer class based on their respective rates 
due to the seasonal fluctuations of ipc s load  the amount of unbilled revenue increases during the summer and winter months and decreases during the spring and fall 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and ipc s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the following table presents earnings for idacorp s segments as well as for the holding company ipc utility operations idacorp financial services idacorp energy ida west energy holding company expenses discontinued operations total earnings average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share 
table of contents utility operations operating environment ipc is one of the nation s few investor owned utilities with a predominantly hydroelectric generating base 
because of its reliance on hydroelectric generation  ipc s generation operations can be significantly affected by weather conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of ipc s hydroelectric facilities  springtime snow pack run off  rainfall and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into ipc s hydroelectric projects are reduced  ipc s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
this results in less generation from ipc s resource portfolio hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired available for off system sales and  most likely  an increased use of purchased power to meet load requirements 
both of these situations a reduction in off system sales and an increased use of more expensive purchased power result in increased power supply costs 
during high water years  increased off system sales and the decreased need for purchased power reduce net power supply costs 
operations plans are developed during the year to provide guidance for generation resource utilization and energy market activities off system sales and power purchases 
the plans incorporate forecasts for generation unit availability  reservoir storage and stream flows  gas and coal prices  customer loads  energy market prices and other pertinent inputs 
consideration is given to when to use ipc s available resources to meet forecast loads and when to transact in the energy market 
the allocation of hydroelectric generation between heavy load and light load hours or calendar periods is considered in development of the operating plans 
this allocation is intended to utilize the flexibility of the hydroelectric system to shift generation to high value periods  while operating within the constraints imposed on the system 
ipc s energy risk management policy  unit operating requirements and other obligations provide the framework for the plans 
stream flow conditions in were much improved over resulting in million mwh from ipc hydroelectric facilities in  compared to million mwh in the observed stream flow data released on august   by the national weather service s northwest river forecast center indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  or percent of average 
brownlee reservoir inflow for totaled maf  or percent of average 
storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february   was percent of average 
the stream flow forecast released on february  by the national weather service s northwest river forecast center predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of average 
generation from thermal plants during was lower than due primarily to an unanticipated outage at the boardman plant and a planned outage at the valmy plant  of which ipc owns a ten percent and percent interest  respectively 
both units returned to service in june additionally  the bennett mountain combustion turbine suffered a mechanical failure on july  ipc s investigation has revealed that during construction a bolt was negligently installed by a third party 
the bolt came loose  causing extensive mechanical damage 
the plant was down from july through september  total repair costs were approximately million 
ipc anticipates that insurance proceeds and or recovery from the party or parties responsible for the failure will result in substantial reimbursement of these costs 
ipc s system load peaks in the summer and winter  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the new all time system peak demand was  megawatts mw  set on july  the peak winter demand for the year was  mw on december ipc was able to meet system load requirements and off system sales requirements and had sufficient system reserves in place 
the following table presents ipc s power supply for the last three years mwh total system purchased hydroelectric thermal generation power total ipc s median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh  based on median hydrologic conditions for the standardized period of record  through general business revenue the primary influences on electricity sales are weather  customer growth and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
increased precipitation reduces electricity usage by these customers

a degree day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees 
each degree of temperature above degrees is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below degrees is counted as one heating degree day 
normal heating degree days and cooling degree days are  and  respectively 
vs 
rates rate decreases negatively impacted general business revenue by million in as compared to prior year 
a pca reduction on june   decreased rates by an average of percent but was moderated by a net base rate increase of percent on june  percent base rate increase effective june   less a one time base rate increase of percent related to a rate case tax settlement which expired on the same date 
prior year revenues also included amounts related to a rate case tax settlement and an irrigation load reduction rate adjustment  both of which were recovered from june to may with a corresponding reduction to other revenues  customers general business customer growth improved revenue million for the year  as ipc continues to experience customer growth in its service territory 
the residential customer base month average increased percent over prior year  and usage weather variations positively impacted sales by million 
conditions were unusually warm in may  june and july compared to the prior year  which had an abnormally cool and wet spring 
vs 
rates increased average rates resulting from higher base rates that took effect on june in both and increased revenues million 
this was partially offset by a net reduction in the power cost adjustment rates  which reduced revenue million from approximately million of the rate increase represents collection of previously recorded revenues from the irrigation load reduction program and rate case tax settlement 
this revenue is offset by a corresponding reduction to other revenues for the same amount  
table of contents customers a percent increase in average general business customers increased revenue million  as ipc continued to experience strong customer growth in its service territory 
ipc added over  general business customers during the year  and usage heavy spring precipitation reduced sales to irrigation customers by million 
rainfall during the second quarter of was double that of other weather and usage factors reduced sales to other customers by million 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
the following table measures ipc s off system sales for the last three years revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
in  the mwh volume sold more than doubled and revenues grew percent 
improved stream flow conditions increased total system generation and electricity available for surplus sales 
revenue from higher sales volumes were moderated by lower prices caused by abundant energy in the region 
the volume increase was also impacted by early water year indications suggesting continued drought conditions for  prompting ipc to make forward purchases in conformance with its risk management policy that were subsequently sold 
additional sales activities are the result of conforming to ipc s risk management policy  managing ipc s energy portfolio to meet customer load  and ipc reacting to changes in market conditions to minimize net power supply costs 
vs 
revenues grew percent due to higher energy prices in market prices were higher and more volatile because of oil and gas price increases due to instability in the middle east and hurricane damage on the gulf coast 
for the northwest  continuation of drought conditions in the region compounded the impact of these global problems 
consequently  off system sales revenue on a per mwh basis increased percent for the year 
off system sales volumes declined four percent  due primarily to changes in operating conditions and load and stream flow timing  which reduced market sales opportunities 
other revenues the following table presents the components of other revenues transmission services and property rental bpa credit rate case tax settlement irrigation lost revenues total vs 
other revenues decreased million due mainly to the following in  ipc recorded a million provision for rate refund associated with a revised open access transmission tariff oatt filing with the ferc requesting an increase in transmission rates 
this matter is discussed further in regulatory matters  in december  ipc recorded a million revenue reduction related to estimated refundable wheeling revenues and a true up of transmission use of facility rates from through vs 
other revenues decreased million due mainly to the following in december  ipc recorded approximately million related to the recovery of lost revenue resulting from ipc s irrigation load reduction program 
the recovery was included as part of ipc s annual pca beginning on june   and million has been amortized as the amounts are billed 
this matter is discussed further in regulatory matters deferred power supply costs idaho  
table of contents in  ipc recognized approximately million of revenue due to the ipuc order approving settlement no 
 which relates to the calculation of ipc s taxes for purposes of test year income tax expense in the idaho general rate case 
as a result of this settlement  ipc recorded a regulatory asset of approximately million from june  through may  million in and million in 
ipc began collecting this amount beginning in june with an adjustment to rates and million has been amortized as the amounts are billed  and in july  ipc recognized million of revenue from an agreement with the bonneville power administration for the release of  acre feet of storage water from brownlee reservoir 
this amount was included in the june  pca resulting in a benefit to ipc s idaho customers 
purchased power expense mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
purchased power expense grew percent in record high temperatures and electricity demand  particularly in july  led to increased purchases during a period of high market prices 
the increase was also impacted by early water year indications suggesting continued drought conditions for  which prompted ipc to make forward purchases in conformance with its risk management policy 
additional purchase activities were the result of managing ipc s energy portfolio to meet customer load and reacting to changes in market conditions to minimize net power supply costs 
vs 
purchased power expense grew percent due to higher energy prices in market prices were higher and more volatile for the reasons discussed above 
purchased power expense on a per mwh basis increased percent for the year 
purchased power volumes declined nine percent 
different operating conditions and system load and stream flow timing led to reduced market purchase activities 
fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
the increase in fuel expense is due primarily to a million increase in expense from higher coal and rail transportation costs 
the increased cost of coal is due primarily to higher market demand  and the increased rail transportation costs are primarily driven by higher diesel fuel costs  including an adjustable fuel surcharge 
higher natural gas costs of million also contributed to the increase 
generation from the coal fired power plants was down percent due to unplanned outages at valmy and boardman 
this decrease resulted in a million decrease in fuel expense 
vs 
fuel expenses and thermal plant volumes were essentially unchanged in as compared with pca pca expense represents the effect of ipc s pca regulatory mechanism  which is discussed in more detail below in regulatory matters deferred power supply costs idaho 
in  higher electricity purchase volumes  particularly in july during a period of high market prices  coupled with increased coal and natural gas prices  caused an increase in net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less off system sales over the amounts anticipated in the annual pca forecast 
this increase in net power supply costs was partially offset by increased hydroelectric generation in the first half of  resulting in the deferral of costs which will be recovered in subsequent rate years 
as the deferred costs are being recovered in rates  the deferred balances are amortized 
in and actual net power supply costs also exceeded the amounts anticipated in the annual pca forecast 

table of contents the following table presents the components of pca expense current year net power supply cost deferral amortization of prior year authorized balances settlement agreement total power cost adjustment other operations and maintenance expenses vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses increased million due mainly to the following an increase in labor related expenses of million due to higher salaries and incentive based compensation  partially triggered by improved steamflow conditions and the sale of iti  an increase of million in hydroelectric and distribution o m expenses attributable to better generation conditions and the growth in general business customers  an increase of million in thermal o m expense resulting primarily from costs due to an extended outage in at the valmy plant  and a write off of million in the fourth quarter of for deferred development costs associated with the attempted formation of grid west 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain resulting from the sale of emission allowances during the year and a million reversal of accrued ferc fees 
ipc and several other utilities contested whether certain federal agency charges could be passed on to utilities through ferc fees 
a judgment in favor of ipc and the other utilities was finalized in september 
vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million due mainly to the write off of million related to disallowed items in the idaho general rate case 
non utility operations ifs ifs earned million  million  and million in  and  respectively  principally from the generation of federal income tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits 
the results included a million gain  net of tax  in other income on idacorp s consolidated statements of income for the sale of its investment in the el cortez hotel in san diego  california

status of audit proceedings in march  the internal revenue service irs began its examination of idacorp s tax years 
on october   the irs issued its examination report and assessment for those years 
with the exception of ipc s capitalized overhead costs method  discussed below  the irs and idacorp were able to settle all issues 
the million federal tax assessment for the settled issues was paid in november interest charges and state income taxes have been accrued and are expected to be paid during settlement of the agreed issues decreased income tax expense by million at idacorp and million at ipc as the assessed deficiency was less than amounts previously accrued 

table of contents the irs disallowed ipc s capitalized overhead cost method for uniform capitalization the simplified service cost method on the basis that ipc s self constructed assets were not produced on a routine and repetitive basis as defined by rev 
rul 
the disallowance resulted in a federal tax assessment of million 
idacorp disagreed with this conclusion and in november filed its formal protest and request for an appeals conference 
also in november  idacorp made a refundable deposit of the disputed tax with the irs to stop the accrual of interest 
in december  the irs examination team filed its rebuttal to idacorp s protest 
in january  idacorp was notified that its case has been assigned to the irs appeals office 
idacorp cannot predict the timing or outcome of this process  but believes that an adequate provision for income taxes and related interest charges has been made for this issue 
the simplified service cost method was also used for ipc s tax year 
while is not currently under examination  it is likely the irs will take the same position for as it did for  however  it is not likely that this position will result in a federal income tax assessment primarily due to the mitigating effect of accelerated tax depreciation 
on july   the irs issued its examination report for bridger coal company s tax years 
bridger coal is a partnership investment owned one third by ipc 
the audit resulted in net favorable adjustments to bridger coal s tax returns for those years 
as a result of the settlement  idacorp and ipc were able to decrease income tax expense by million 
in  idacorp completed settlement of all issues related to the irs s examination of its federal income tax returns for the years through concurrently  ipc settled federal income tax deficiencies for the years and related to its partnership investment in bridger coal company 
applicable state tax return amendments were completed in and settled 
finalization of these examinations resulted in deficiencies that were less than previously accrued  enabling idacorp to decrease income tax expense by million in capitalized overhead costs generally  section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended  requires the capitalization of all direct costs and indirect costs  including mixed service costs  which directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the production of property by a taxpayer 
the simplified service cost method  a safe harbor method  is one of the methods provided by the section a treasury regulations for the calculation of mixed service cost capitalization 
ipc adopted the simplified service cost method for both the self construction of utility plant and production of electricity beginning with its federal income tax return 
on august   the irs and the treasury department issued guidance interpreting the meaning of routine and repetitive for purposes of the simplified service cost and simplified production methods of the internal revenue code section a uniform capitalization rules 
the guidance was issued in the form of a revenue ruling rev 
rul 
which is effective for all open tax years ending prior to august   and proposed and temporary regulations the temporary regulations which are effective for tax years ending on or after august  both pieces of guidance take a more restrictive view of the definition of self constructed assets produced by a taxpayer on a routine and repetitive basis than did treasury regulations in effect at the time ipc changed to the simplified service cost method 
for ipc  the simplified service cost method produced a current tax deduction for costs capitalized to electricity production that are capitalized into fixed assets for financial accounting purposes 
deferred income tax expense had not been provided for this deduction because the prescribed regulatory tax accounting treatment does not allow for inclusion of such deferred tax expense in current rates 
rate regulated enterprises are required to recognize such adjustments as regulatory assets if it is probable that such amounts will be recovered from customers in future rates 
as discussed in status of audit proceedings above  the irs has disallowed ipc s use of the simplified service cost method for the tax years on the basis of rev 
rul 
as a result  the irs has assessed a million tax liability 
idacorp is in the process of appealing the irs s assessment 
because of the nature of the issue  idacorp s exposure with respect to this matter may be less than the tax assessed plus applicable interest charges 
additionally  after resolution idacorp will likely amend its federal income tax return and its method change application to account for the effects that such resolution has on ipc s new uniform capitalization method discussed below 
this amendment is not expected to have a material negative impact on idacorp s or ipc s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
with respect to tax year and future tax years  the temporary regulations  as drafted  preclude ipc from using the simplified service cost method for its self constructed assets 
under the temporary regulations  ipc is required to use another allowable section a method for its indirect costs  including mixed service costs 
as a result of the temporary regulations  ipc made changes to its overall section a uniform capitalization method of accounting 
in september  the changes were adopted with an automatic method change request included in idacorp s federal income tax return 
the uniform capitalization methodology adopted for and subsequent years involves the use of the specific identification  burden rate  and step allocation methods of accounting 
the methods used are allowable under both the final and temporary section a regulations 

table of contents as with the simplified service cost method  the new uniform capitalization methodology produces an annual tax deduction for costs that are not required to be capitalized under section a as well as costs capitalized into the production of electricity 
the method  while producing a beneficial result  is not as favorable as the simplified service cost method 
changing the uniform capitalization method resulted in a net charge to ipc s income tax expense of million 
the estimated tax deduction produced a million tax benefit for the year 
the change in method did not have a material effect on idacorp s or ipc s cash flows 
the accounting and regulatory treatment for the new method is the same as previously used for the simplified service cost method 
liquidity and capital resources discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations are included with the cash flows from continuing operations in idacorp s consolidated statements of cash flows 
the cash flows of idacorp s discontinued operations have reduced net cash provided by operating activities and increased net cash used in investing activities  except for the cash received in from the sale of iti 
the absence of cash flows from these discontinued operations is expected to positively impact liquidity and capital resources in future periods 
operating cash flows idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows for were million and million  respectively 
these amounts were an increase of million and decrease of million compared to the following are significant items that affected operating cash flows in income tax payments increased in due to the timing of and increases in taxable income  including the timing effect of cash received in the fourth quarter of from the sale of approximately million of excess so emission allowances 
in  ie collected million of amounts receivable from the cal iso and calpx  and collected million that it had deposited on margin with a counterparty in idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows for were million and million  respectively  decreases of million and million compared to the decreases were mainly related to a million reduction in distributions from the bridger coal joint venture  as bridger is retaining cash to fund increased capital expenditures for conversion to underground mining 
timing of cash disbursements made in for december payable balances  including million in employee incentive compensation paid during the first quarter of idacorp s operating cash flows are driven principally by ipc 
general business revenues and the costs to supply power to general business customers have the greatest impact on ipc s operating cash flows  and are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs and provide a return on investment 
investing cash flows ipc s construction expenditures were million in  million in and million in ipc is experiencing a cycle of heavy infrastructure investment needed to address continued customer growth  peak demand growth  and aging plant and equipment 
in and  sales of emission allowances provided investing cash of approximately million before taxes and expenses 
pursuant to negotiations with the ipuc  ipc will return approximately million to idaho ratepayers starting in june see further discussion in regulatory matters emission allowances 
in november  idacorp made a refundable deposit of million with the irs related to a disputed income tax assessment 
see further discussion in results of operations income taxes

table of contents utility construction program ipc is experiencing a cycle of heavy infrastructure investment needed to address continued customer growth  peak demand growth  and aging plant and equipment 
ipc s aging hydroelectric facilities require continuing upgrades and component replacement 
in addition  costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities and complying with the new licenses are substantial 
continuing load growth also requires that ipc add to its transmission system and distribution facilities to provide new service and to maintain reliability 
planned expenditures include distribution and high voltage transmission lines for new customers and several lines 
as a result  ipc expects to spend million in construction expenditures from to the utility construction expenditure forecast includes million of construction costs for a mw combustion turbine peaking resource expected to be operational in mid  million for an upgrade to the shoshone falls hydroelectric facility expected to be operational in  and million for hydroelectric relicensing 
ipc s integrated resource plan identifies two mw coal fired resources utilizing pulverized coal and coal gasification technologies needed in and the estimates of capital expenditures exclude the potential impact related to the construction or acquisition of these coal fired resources and related transmission capacity 
the development of coal resources requires very long lead times with significant expenditures spread over many years making accurate estimates difficult 
at this time and subject to further evaluation and screening  ipc estimates that million to million could be spent from to for the development of these projects 
ipc will continue to review and update its options and will evaluate financing strategies to fund these capital requirements 
see further discussion in regulatory matters integrated resource plan and regulatory matters relicensing of hydroelectric projects 
ipc has no nuclear involvement and its future construction plans do not include development or ownership of any nuclear generation 
other capital requirements most of idacorp s non regulated capital expenditures relate to ifs s investments in affordable housing developments that help lower idacorp s income tax liability 
internal cash generation after dividends is expected to provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through idacorp s internally generated cash after dividends is expected to provide approximately percent of capital requirements excluding mandatory or optional principal payments on debt obligations 
excluding the ratepayer emission refunds  idacorp s internally generated cash after dividends is expected to provide approximately percent of capital requirements 
idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing capital requirements with internally generated funds and externally financed capital

credit facilities idacorp has a million five year credit agreement that terminates on march  the idacorp facility 
the idacorp facility  which is used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up  provides for the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of million  provided that the aggregate amount of the standby letters of credit may not exceed million

the ipc facility  which is used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up  provides for the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of million  provided that the aggregate amount of the standby letters of credit may not exceed million 

table of contents both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility have similar terms and conditions 
under the terms of the facilities idacorp and ipc may borrow floating rate advances and eurodollar rate advances 
the floating rate is equal to the higher of i the prime rate announced by wachovia bank or its parent and ii the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus percent per annum  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the eurodollar rate is based upon the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in us dollars published on the telerate page or any successor page as adjusted by the applicable reserve requirement for eurocurrency liabilities imposed under regulation d of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  for periods of one  two  three or six months plus the applicable margin 
the margin is based the applicable company s rating for senior unsecured long term debt securities without third party credit enhancement as provided by moody s and s p 
the margin for the floating rate advances is zero percent unless the applicable company s rating falls below baa from moody s or bbb from s p  at which time it would equal percent 
the margin for eurodollar rate advances ranges from percent to percent depending upon the credit rating 
in addition to the margin  if the outstanding aggregate credit exposure exceeds percent of the facility amount  idacorp or ipc  as applicable  would pay a utilization fee ranging from percent to percent on outstanding loans depending on the credit rating 
at december   the applicable margin under the idacorp facility and the ipc facility was zero percent for floating rate advances and percent for eurodollar rate advances and percent for a utilization fee 
a facility fee  payable quarterly  is calculated on the average daily aggregate commitment of the lenders under the relevant credit facility and is also based on the applicable company s rating from moody s or s p as indicated above 
at december   the facility fee under each facility was percent 
in connection with the issuance of letters of credit  idacorp and ipc  as applicable  must pay i a fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate advances on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such letters of credit  payable quarterly in arrears  ii a fronting fee at a per annum rate of percent on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit  payable quarterly in arrears and iii documentary and processing charges in accordance with the letter of credit issuer s standard schedule for such charges 
a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing and of maintaining letters of credit  but would not result in any default or acceleration of the debt under either the idacorp facility or the ipc facility 
the events of default under both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility include i nonpayment of principal when due and nonpayment of reimbursement obligations under letters of credit within one business day after becoming due and nonpayment of interest or other fees within five days after becoming due  ii materially false representations or warranties made on behalf of the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries on the date as of which made  iii breach of covenants  subject in some instances to grace periods  iv voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy of the applicable company or any material subsidiary  v the non consensual appointment of a receiver or similar official for the applicable company or any of its material subsidiaries or any substantial portion as defined in the applicable facility of its property  vi condemnation of all or any substantial portion of the property of the applicable company or its subsidiaries  vii default in the payment of indebtedness in excess of million or a default by the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement under which such debt was created or governed which will cause or permit the acceleration of such debt or if any of such debt is declared to be due and payable prior to its stated maturity  viii the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries not paying  or admitting in writing its inability to pay  its debts as they become due  ix the acquisition by any person or two or more persons acting in concert of beneficial ownership within the meaning of rule d of the securities exchange act of of percent or more of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the applicable company  x the failure of idacorp to own free and clear of all liens  all of the outstanding shares of voting stock of ipc  xi unfunded liabilities of all single employer plans under the employee retirement income security act of exceeding million and xii the applicable company or any subsidiary being subject to any proceeding or investigation pertaining to the release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment or any violation of any environmental law as defined in the applicable facility which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect as defined in the applicable facility 
a default or an acceleration of indebtedness of ipc in excess of million  including indebtedness under the ipc facility will result in a cross default under the idacorp facility 

table of contents upon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of idacorp or ipc or the appointment of a receiver  the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable 
upon any other event of default  the lenders holding percent of the outstanding loans or percent of the aggregate commitments required lenders or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit under the facility or declare the obligations to be due and payable 
idacorp and ipc will also be required to deposit into a collateral account an amount equal to the aggregate undrawn stated amount under all outstanding letters of credit and the aggregate unpaid reimbursement obligations thereunder 
if there is a ratings downgrade below investment grade bbb or higher by s p and baa or higher by moody s  then ipc s authority for continuing borrowings under its regulatory approvals issued by the ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc must be extended or renewed during the occurrence of the ratings downgrade 
the oregon statutes  however  permit the issuance or renewal of indebtedness maturing not more than one year after the date of such issue or renewal without approval of the opuc 
in an order issued may   the ipuc clarified that ipc s authority will not terminate but will continue for a period of days from any downgrade below investment grade 
at december   no loans were outstanding under the idacorp facility or the ipc facility 
debt covenants the idacorp facility and the ipc facility each contain a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of no more than percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december   the leverage ratios for idacorp and ipc were and percent  respectively 
at december   idacorp was in compliance with all other covenants of the idacorp facility and ipc was in compliance with all other covenants of the ipc facility 
both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility contain additional covenants including i prohibitions against investments and acquisitions by the applicable company or any subsidiary without the consent of the required lenders subject to exclusions for investments in cash equivalents or securities of the applicable company  investments by the applicable company and its subsidiaries in any business trust controlled  directly or indirectly  by the applicable company to the extent such business trust purchases securities of the applicable company  investments and acquisitions related to the energy business or other business of the applicable company and its subsidiaries not exceeding million in the aggregate at any one time outstanding provided that investments in non energy related businesses do not exceed million  and investments by the applicable company or a subsidiary in connection with a permitted receivables securitization as defined in the facility  ii prohibitions against the applicable company or any material subsidiary merging or consolidating with any other person or selling or disposing of all or substantially all of its property to another person without the consent of the required lenders  subject to exclusions for mergers into or dispositions to the applicable company or a wholly owned subsidiary and dispositions in connection with a permitted receivables securitization  iii restrictions on the creation of certain liens by the applicable company or any material subsidiary subject to exceptions  including the lien of ipc s first mortgage indebtedness  and iv prohibitions on any material subsidiary of the applicable company entering into any agreement restricting its ability to declare or pay dividends to the applicable company except pursuant to a permitted receivables securitization 
credit ratings s p on march   s p announced that it had revised its general corporate credit rating outlooks for idacorp and ipc to negative from stable 
all other s p credit ratings for idacorp and ipc were reaffirmed 
s p stated that the negative outlooks reflect the potential for weakened financial metrics as a result of several factors  including possible passage of the water diversion legislation and uncertainty regarding the federal and state tax treatment and allocation of previous refunds of about million see income taxes capitalized overhead costs above and note to idacorp s and ipc s condensed consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of capitalized overhead costs

and shorthouse  et al 
v 
idacorp  inc  et al  raised largely similar allegations 
the lawsuits were putative class actions brought on behalf of purchasers of idacorp stock between february  and june   and were filed in the us district court for the district of idaho 
the named defendants in each suit  in addition to idacorp  are jon h 
miller  jan b 
packwood  j 
lamont keen and darrel t 
anderson 

table of contents the complaints alleged that  during the purported class period  idacorp and or certain of its officers and or directors made materially false and misleading statements or omissions about the company s financial outlook in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b  thereby causing investors to purchase idacorp s common stock at artificially inflated prices 
more specifically  the complaints alleged that idacorp failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly disregarded by them idacorp failed to appreciate the negative impact that lower volatility and reduced pricing spreads in the western wholesale energy market would have on its marketing subsidiary  ie  idacorp would be forced to limit its origination activities to shorter term transactions due to increasing regulatory uncertainty and continued deterioration of creditworthy counterparties  idacorp failed to account for the fact that ipc may not recover from the lingering effects of the prior year s regional drought and as a result of the foregoing  defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about idacorp and their earnings projections 
the powell complaint also alleged that the defendants conduct artificially inflated the price of idacorp s common stock 
the actions seek an unspecified amount of damages  as well as other forms of relief 
by order dated august   the court consolidated the powell and shorthouse cases for pretrial purposes  and ordered the plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint within days 
on november   idacorp and the directors and officers named above were served with a purported consolidated complaint captioned powell  et al 
v 
idacorp  inc  et al  which was filed in the us district court for the district of idaho 
the new complaint alleged that during the class period idacorp and or certain of its officers and or directors made materially false and misleading statements or omissions about its business operations  and specifically the ie financial outlook  in violation of rule b  thereby causing investors to purchase idacorp s common stock at artificially inflated prices 
the new complaint alleged that idacorp failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to it or recklessly disregarded by it idacorp falsely inflated the value of energy contracts held by ie in order to report higher revenues and profits  idacorp permitted ipc to inappropriately grant native load priority for certain energy transactions to ie  idacorp failed to file ancillary service agreements involving the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce that it was required to file under section of the federal power act  idacorp failed to file  contracts that ipc assigned to ie for the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce that ipc was required to file under section of the federal power act  idacorp failed to ensure that ie provided appropriate compensation from ie to ipc for certain affiliated energy transactions  and idacorp permitted inappropriate sharing of certain energy pricing and transmission information between ipc and ie 
these activities allegedly allowed ie to maintain a false perception of continued growth that inflated its earnings 
in addition  the new complaint alleges that those earnings press releases  earnings release conference calls  analyst reports and revised earnings guidance releases issued during the class period were false and misleading 
the action seeks an unspecified amount of damages  as well as other forms of relief 
idacorp and the other defendants filed a consolidated motion to dismiss on february   and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the consolidated motion to dismiss on march  idacorp and the other defendants filed their response to the plaintiff s opposition on april  and oral argument on the motion was held on may  on september   magistrate judge mikel h 
williams of the us district court for the district of idaho issued a report and recommendation that the defendants motion to dismiss be granted and that the case be dismissed 
the magistrate judge determined that the plaintiffs did not satisfactorily plead loss causation ie  a causal connection between the alleged material misrepresentation and the loss in conformance with the standards set forth in the recent united states supreme court decision of dura pharmaceuticals  inc v 
broudo  us  s 
ct 

the magistrate judge also concluded that it would be futile to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint because it did not appear that they could cure the deficiencies in their pleadings 
each party filed objections to different parts of the magistrate judge s report and recommendation 
on march   the us district court for the district of idaho judge edward j 
lodge issued an order in this case powell v 
idacorp adopting the report and recommendation of magistrate judge williams issued on september   granting the defendants idacorp and certain of its officers and directors motion to dismiss because plaintiffs failed to satisfy the pleading requirements for loss causation 
however  judge lodge modified the report and recommendation and ruled that plaintiffs had until may   to file an amended complaint only as to the loss causation element 
on may   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on june   asserting that the amended complaint still failed to satisfy the pleading requirements for loss causation 
briefing on this most recent motion to dismiss was completed on august  and oral argument was held on february  idacorp and the other defendants intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations 
idacorp cannot  however  predict the outcome of these matters

western energy proceedings at the ferc ie and ipc are involved in a number of ferc proceedings arising out of the western energy situation in california and claims that dysfunctions in the organized california markets contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices in pacific northwest spot markets  and may have been the result of manipulations of gas or electric power markets 
they include proceedings involving 
table of contents california power exchange chargeback the chargeback provisions of the california power exchange calpx participation agreement triggered when a participant defaulted on a payment to the calpx 
upon such a default  other participants were required to pay their allocated share of the default amount to the calpx 
this provision was first triggered by the southern california edison default and later by the pacific gas and electric company default 
the ferc has ordered the calpx to hold the chargeback funds and that such funds may be used to make up individual seller shortfalls in their calpx account at the conclusion of the california refund proceeding 
based upon the offer of settlement filed with the ferc on february  between the california parties and ie and ipc discussed below in the california refund proceeding  the california parties supported a motion filed by ie and ipc with the ferc seeking an order directing return of chargeback amounts then held by the calpx totaling million 
in the may  order approving the settlement  the ferc granted the ie and ipc motion for return of chargeback funds held by the calpx 
on june   ie received approximately million from the calpx representing the return of million in chargeback funds plus interest 
california refund proceeding which originated with an effort by the state of california to obtain refunds for a portion of the spot market sales from sellers of electricity into california from october  through june  california is claiming that the sales prices were not just and reasonable and were not in compliance with the federal power act 
the ferc issued an order on refund liability on march  on which multiple parties  including ie  sought rehearing 
on october   the ferc denied the requests for rehearing and required the california independent system operator cal iso to make a compliance filing regarding refund amounts within five months  which has been delayed on a number of occasions and has not yet been filed with the ferc 
on may   the ferc issued an order clarifying its earlier refund orders and denying a request by certain parties to present as evidence an earlier settlement between the california public utilities commission and el paso related to manipulation of gas pipeline capacity claiming that the settlement dollars california is receiving from el paso billion are duplicative of the ferc order changing the gas component of its refund methodology 
the ferc denied requests for rehearing on november  on december   ie and others petitioned the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit for review of the ferc s orders on california refunds 
as additional ferc orders have been issued  further petitions for review have been filed  including by ie  and have been consolidated with the appeals already pending before the ninth circuit 
on september   the ninth circuit convened the first of its case management proceedings  a procedure reserved to help organize complex cases 
on october   the ninth circuit severed several issues related to the ferc s refund jurisdiction  established a schedule for briefing and held oral argument on april and  on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision in one of the severed cases concluding that the ferc lacked refund authority over wholesale electrical energy sales made by governmental entities and non public utilities 
on august   the ninth circuit issued its decision on a second severed case ruling that all transactions that occurred within or as a result of the calpx and the cal iso were the proper subject of the refund proceeding  refused to expand the proceedings into the bilateral market  approved the refund effective date as october  but required ferc to reconsider based upon claims that some market participants had violated governing tariff obligations the california parties are seeking a refund effective date of may   and effectively expanded the scope of the refund proceeding to transactions within the calpx and cal iso markets outside the hour spot market and energy exchange transactions 
on august  the ferc issued an order establishing a framework for those sellers wanting to make a cost filing to demonstrate that the generally applicable ferc refund methodology interfered with the recovery of costs 
the companies along with others made a cost filing on september   the california entities commented on october   and ipc and ie replied to those comments on october  the california entities filed supplemental comments on october  and the companies filed supplemental reply comments on october  in december  ie and ipc reached a tentative agreement with the california parties settling matters encompassed by the california refund proceeding including ie and ipc s cost filing and refund obligation 
on january   the parties filed a request with the ferc asking that the ferc defer ruling on ie and ipc s cost filing for thirty days so the parties could complete and file the settlement agreement with the ferc 
on january   the ferc granted the requested deferral of a ruling on the cost filing and required that the settlement be filed by february  on february   ie and ipc jointly filed with the california parties pacific gas electric company  san diego gas electric company  southern california edison company  the california public utilities commission  the california electricity oversight board  the california department of water resources and the california attorney general an offer of settlement at the ferc 
other parties had until march  to elect to become an additional settling party 
final comments on the settlement were due to be filed by march  a number of other parties  representing substantially less than the majority of potential refund claims  chose to opt out of the settlement 

table of contents on march   the ferc issued an order rejecting the ie ipc cost filing and on april   ie and ipc sought rehearing of the rejection 
by order of april   the ferc tolled the time for what otherwise would have been required by statute to make a decision on the request for rehearing 
on may   the ferc issued an order determining the method that should be used to allocate amounts approved in cost filings  approving the methodology that ie and ipc and others had advocated prior to the time ie and ipc entered into the february  settlement allocating cost offsets to buyers in proportion to the net refunds they are owed through the cal iso and calpx markets 
on june   the california parties requested rehearing  urging the ferc to allocate the cost offsets to all purchasers from the cal iso and calpx markets and not just to that limited subset of purchasers who are net refund recipients 
on july   the ferc tolled the time to act on the request for rehearing and has not issued orders on rehearing since that time 
idacorp and ipc are unable to predict how or when the ferc might rule on the request for rehearing 
after consideration of comments  the ferc approved the february  offer of settlement on may  under the terms of the settlement  ie and ipc assigned million of the rights to accounts receivable from the cal iso and calpx to the california parties to pay into an escrow account for refunds to settling parties 
amounts from that escrow not used for settling parties and million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables that are to be retained by the calpx are available to fund  at least partially  payment of the claims of any non settling parties if they prevail in the remaining litigation of this matter 
any excess funds remaining at the end of the case are to be returned to ipc and ie 
approximately million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables was paid to ie and ipc under the settlement 
on june   the port of seattle  washington filed a request for rehearing of the ferc order approving the settlement 
on july   ipc and ie and the california parties filed a response to port of seattle s request for rehearing 
on october   the ferc issued an order denying the port of seattle s request for rehearing 
on october   the port of seattle petitioned the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit for review of the ferc orders approving the settlement 
the ninth circuit consolidated that review petition with the large number of review petitions already consolidated before it 
on january   ipc and ie filed a motion to sever the port of seattle s petition for review from the bulk of cases pending in the ninth circuit with which it had been consolidated 
ipc and ie also filed a motion to dismiss the port of seattle s petition for review 
the port of seattle filed their answers in opposition to the motion to sever and the motion to dismiss on february   and ipc and ie replied on february  idacorp and ipc are not able to predict when or how the ninth circuit might rule on the motions 
on december   with respect to the calpx chargeback and the california refund proceedings discussed above  the calpx and the cal iso owed million and million  respectively  for energy sales made to them by ipc in november and december in the fourth quarter of  ie reduced by million to million its reserve against these receivables 
this reserve was calculated taking into account the uncertainty of collection  given the california energy situation 
following payment of the million to ie and ipc in june  ie further reduced the reserve by million to million 
this reserve was calculated taking into account several unresolved issues in the california refund proceeding 
based on the reserve recorded as of december   idacorp believes that the future collectibility of these receivables or any potential refunds ordered by the ferc would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
pacific northwest refund proceedings wherein it was argued that the spot market in the pacific northwest was affected by the dysfunction in the california market  warranting refunds 
the ferc rejected this claim on june   and denied rehearing on november  and february  the ferc orders were appealed to the ninth circuit 
oral argument was held on january  the companies intend to vigorously defend their position in this proceeding and believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents market manipulation two ferc show cause orders which resulted from a ruling of the ninth circuit that the ferc permit the california parties in the california refund proceeding to submit materials to the ferc demonstrating market manipulation by various sellers of electricity into california 
on june   the ferc ordered a large number of parties including ipc to show cause why certain trading practices did not constitute gaming gaming or anomalous market behavior partnership in violation of the cal iso and calpx tariffs 
on october   ipc reached agreement with the ferc staff on the show cause orders 
the gaming settlement was approved by the ferc on march  the ferc approved the motion to dismiss the partnership proceeding on january  although the orders establishing the scope of the show cause proceedings are presently the subject of review petitions in the ninth circuit  the order dismissing ipc from the partnership proceedings was not the subject of rehearing requests 
originally  eight parties requested rehearing of the ferc s march  order approving the gaming settlement 
the settlement between the california parties and ie and ipc discussed above in the california refund proceeding approved by the ferc on may   results in the california parties and other settling parties withdrawing their requests for rehearing of ipc s and ie s settlement with the ferc staff regarding allegations of gaming 
on october   the ferc issued an order denying rehearing of its earlier approval of the gaming allegations  thereby effectively terminating the ferc investigations as to ipc and ie regarding bidding behavior  physical withholding of power and gaming without finding of wrongdoing 
on october   the port of seattle appealed the ferc order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
in addition to the two show cause orders  on june   the ferc also issued an order instituting an investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western wholesale markets for the time period may  through october  to review evidence of economic withholding of generation

ipc is vigorously pursuing its interest in this matter 
environmental issues idaho water management issues idaho experienced six consecutive years of below normal precipitation and stream flows from through these conditions exacerbated a developing water shortage in the state  which is manifested by a number of water issues including declining snake river base flows and declining levels in the eastern snake plain aquifer  a large underground aquifer that has been estimated to hold between maf of water 
these issues are of interest to ipc because of their potential impacts on generation at ipc s hydroelectric projects 
with respect to base flows  observed records suggest that the base flows in the snake river  particularly between ipc s twin falls and swan falls projects  have been in decline for several decades 
the yearly average flow measured below swan falls declined at an average rate of cubic feet per second cfs per year during the period  and between twin falls and lower salmon falls  which significantly contribute to base flow  declined at a rate of approximately cfs per year over the same period 
low flow in the snake river near hagerman  idaho was observed during  where several river gauges in that area recorded the lowest january march snake river flows since the early s 

table of contents as a result of these declines in river flows  in several surface water users filed delivery calls with the idaho department of water resources idwr  demanding that it manage ground water withdrawals pursuant to the prior appropriation doctrine of first in time is first in right and curtail junior ground water rights that are depleting the aquifer and affecting flows to senior surface water rights 
these delivery calls have resulted in several administrative actions before the idwr and judicial actions before the state district court in ada and gooding counties in idaho challenging the constitutionality of state regulations used by the idwr to conjunctively administer ground and surface water rights 
one such action  filed in january  involves seven surface water irrigation entities from above milner dam that submitted a delivery call letter to the director of the idwr requesting that the director administer and deliver their senior natural flow and storage water rights pursuant to idaho law 
the irrigation entities contend that existing data reflects that senior surface water rights above milner dam have been reduced by approximately  acre feet  a percent reduction  over the past six years  due in part to junior groundwater pumping from the eastern snake plain aquifer  and that these reductions have resulted in cumulative shortages in natural flow and storage water accrual in american falls reservoir  a us bureau of reclamation reservoir that supplies a portion of their senior water rights 
the idaho ground water appropriators  inc  an idaho non profit corporation organized to promote and represent the interests of groundwater users  and the us bureau of reclamation  the owner of american falls reservoir  petitioned to intervene in the delivery call action 
both petitions were granted 
since ipc holds water rights that are dependent on the snake river  spring flows and the overall condition of the eastern snake plain aquifer  ipc continues to participate in actions  as necessary  to protect its water rights 
one such action relates to the constitutionality of the conjunctive management rules cmr that were developed by the idwr to administer connected ground and surface water rights 
in august  the surface water irrigation entities that initiated the delivery call filed an action against the idwr in the state district court in gooding county  idaho for a declaratory judgment regarding the validity and constitutionality of the cmr 
ipc intervened in the action as a plaintiff intervenor in alignment with the surface water users 
the idaho ground water appropriators intervened as a defendant 
in october  the plaintiffs in the case filed a motion for summary judgment  contending that the cmr were unconstitutional and violated the doctrine of prior appropriation as applied in idaho 
after briefing and argument  on june   the district court issued a memorandum decision granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs and holding that the cmr are unconstitutional because the rules failed to protect senior water rights from injury by junior water right diversions 
on july   the idwr appealed the court s order to the idaho supreme court and subsequently filed a motion with the district court asking the court to stay the effect of its order until the conclusion of the appeal 
ipc is participating in the appeal 
on september   the idaho supreme court entered an order denying the stay and expediting the appeal 
oral argument was held on december  and the parties are currently waiting for the court s decision 
ipc  together with other interested water users and state interests  also continues to explore and encourage the development of a long term management plan that will protect the aquifer and the river from further depletion 
one management option being explored is aquifer recharge  or using surface water supplies to increase ground water supplies by allowing the water to percolate into the aquifer in porous locations 
under certain circumstances aquifer recharge may impact senior water rights  including water rights held by ipc for hydropower purposes  and therefore conflict with state law 
for that reason  ipc continues to participate in the processes that are considering solutions  such as aquifer recharge  to the conflict between ground and surface water interests in an effort to protect its existing hydroelectric generation water rights 

table of contents in february  at the request of senior surface water interests  ipc entered into discussions with the state of idaho  through the office of the governor  and senior surface water interests to explore opportunities for engaging in some limited aquifer recharge in  provided any adverse impact to ipc s hydropower generation and its customers was adequately addressed 
these discussions led to a proposal to implement a recharge pilot program in however  before that proposal could be finalized  on march   the house of representatives of the state of idaho passed house bill  which proposed to repeal certain provisions of the idaho code that governed the use of natural water flow to recharge the eastern snake plain aquifer and would have subordinated certain hydropower water rights held by ipc to aquifer recharge 
the introduction of house bill effectively concluded the discussions between ipc  senior surface water interests and the governor s office to implement a pilot recharge project 
ipc strongly opposed house bill because  if it had become law  ipc s hydroelectric generation could have been reduced and ipc would have had to rely on more expensive generation or purchased power to meet customers needs 
this would have resulted in higher costs to ipc s customers 
on march   the senate defeated house bill by a vote of to at the conclusion of the legislative session  the senate passed senate concurrent resolution directing the idaho water resource board iwrb to develop a comprehensive aquifer management plan for the eastern snake plain aquifer espa and to receive public input regarding the goals  objectives  and methods of management for the espa from affected water right holders  cities  counties  the general public and state and federal agencies 
the iwrb initiated a public process for the development of an aquifer management plan in june ipc is participating in that process 
the iwrb is expected to report to the idaho legislature in on the progress of the planning effort 
on april   ipc and the state of idaho entered into a stipulation agreement regarding two water right permits 
the permits allow for limited aquifer recharge and are held by the iwrb 
the two water right permits were issued in the early s  prior to the swan falls agreement 
ipc entered into the swan falls agreement with the governor and attorney general of idaho in october to resolve litigation relating to ipc s water rights at the swan falls project 
in the early s  ipc filed an action identifying approximately  water licenses and permits that had the potential to adversely impact ipc s hydropower water rights at the swan falls project 
the swan falls agreement resolved that litigation 
one provision of the swan falls agreement provided that the action against the  water licenses and permits would be dismissed with prejudice and that ipc s hydropower water rights on the middle snake river would be subordinate to those water rights dismissed 
in the stipulation  ipc and the state recognized that the two water right permits referred to above were named in the action brought by ipc and were subject to the swan falls agreement and that ipc s water rights are therefore subordinate to these water right permits 
ipc cannot determine the financial impact of the stipulation upon ipc and its customers until such time  if ever  that recharge programs under the two water permits are established  but ipc believes that the potential maximum impact in a median water year may be approximately million 
the stipulation also provided that  in the event that there are disagreements between the parties to the swan falls agreement as to the interpretation or application of the agreement  the parties will attempt to resolve those disagreements through informal discussions and negotiations and that in the event that the parties are unable to resolve such disagreements  either party may file a declaratory action with a court of appropriate jurisdiction to have the disagreement resolved 
on december   the state of idaho  through the attorney general s office  filed a notice of claim of ownership with the idwr for a portion of the water rights held by ipc that are subject to the swan falls agreement 
subsequently  idwr filed a director s report with the snake river basin adjudication srba court incorporating the state s claim of ownership and recommending that the srba court decree ipc s water rights in a manner consistent with the state s claim 
ipc disputes the state s claim of ownership and intends to file an objection to the idwr recommendation 
objections must be filed with the srba court by april ipc is currently reviewing the state s ownership claim to determine the potential effect upon ipc s water rights and whether it may affect power generation 
air quality issues ipc owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants and co owns three coal fired power plants that are subject to air quality regulation 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger percent interest located in wyoming  boardman ten percent interest located in oregon  and north valmy percent interest located in nevada 
clean air the environmental protection agency epa issued sulfur dioxide so allowances  as defined in the clean air act amendments of  based on coal consumption during established baseline years 
ipc currently has more than a sufficient amount of so 

allowances to provide compliance for emissions attributable to ipc at all three of its jointly owned coal fired facilities and both of its natural gas fired facilities 

table of contents in july  the epa announced the revised national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
the epa has promulgated regulations designating areas of the country for attainment non attainment with these standards and ipc s thermal plants are currently located in areas designated as attainment for both standards 
on september   the epa adopted a final rule which lowered the hour pm 
particulate matter less than microns standard to micrograms per cubic meter 
states must make their initial recommendations to the epa on attainment and non attainment designations by december however  final designations need not be signed until december and do not take effect until april ipc continues to monitor the status of efforts to implement the new pm 
standard and the designation of areas around its thermal plants 
although the impacts of the naaqs for ozone and particulate matter standards on ipc s thermal operations are not known at this time  the future costs of compliance with these regulations could be substantial and will be dependent on if and how the programs are ultimately implemented 
the clean air interstate rule cair will cap emissions of so and nitrogen oxides in eastern states and the district of columbia 
the cair does not impose any restrictions on emissions from any ipc facilities and  therefore  ipc does not foresee any adverse effects upon its operations as a result of cair 
clean air mercury rule the clean air mercury rule camr will limit mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and creates a market based cap and trade program that will permanently cap utility mercury emissions in two phases  and and beyond 
mercury emission allocations have been set at the state level  but the states are currently working to allocate the allowances to individual power plants 
states had until november   to submit to the epa mercury plans establishing mercury emission standards and allowances for the power plants within their jurisdictions 
mercury continuous emission monitoring systems cems are required to be installed and operational on each coal fired unit by january  ipc is actively monitoring developments on state mercury plans in idaho  wyoming  nevada  and oregon 
on october   the wyoming environmental quality commission approved the wyoming department of environmental quality s wdeq recommended wyoming regulation to implement camr 
this rule will allocate mercury allowances to each plant based on heat input and hold back percent of the allocated allowances for new sources 
this rule will also allow plants to participate in the national cap and trade program 
mercury cems are planned to be installed at the jim bridger plant in and at an estimated cost of million ipc share 
until the mercury cems are installed and operational  the amount of mercury emissions is not definitively known 
it is not possible at this time to determine the effect of the allowance allocation rule on future operations and costs at the plant 
on december   the oregon environmental quality commission oeqc adopted the oregon department of environmental quality proposed utility mercury rule 
ipc estimates that capital expenditures for mercury controls at boardman will be million ipc s share with an annual incremental operations and maintenance cost of up to million ipc s share 
the mercury rule will provide a limited number of mercury allowances to boardman that may be used for trading 
the nevada department of environmental protection has adopted a state camr that will provide mercury allowances to each plant based on actual emissions until  at which time the allowance allocations will be reduced to meet the federal cap 
to meet the reduced allocations in the year  mercury controls are expected to be installed 
mercury cems are planned to be installed at the north valmy plant in and at an estimated cost of million ipc s share 
ipc anticipates that the camr will require additional emission controls and expenses at all of its jointly owned coal fired facilities  although impacts on future plant operations  operating costs and generating capacity are not known at this time 
the idaho board of environmental quality has adopted two new rules a proposed rule to opt out of the federal mercury cap and trade program  and a proposed rule to prohibit the construction and operation of a coal fired power plant in idaho 
the rules will be sent to the idaho legislature for review and approval during its session 
regional haze best available retrofit technology in accordance with new federal regional haze rules  the wdeq and odeq are conducting an assessment of emission sources pursuant to a regional haze best available retrofit technology rh bart process 
coal fired utility boilers are subject to rh bart if they were built between and and affect any class i areas 
this includes all four units at the jim bridger and boardman plants 
the two units at the north valmy plant were constructed after and are not subject to the federal regional haze rule 

table of contents on december   the wdeq adopted regulations to comply with the federal rh bart standard and the jim bridger plant submitted required reports to the wdeq on january  the wdeq will perform a review  including a comment period  and revise the state implementation plan  which is to be provided to the epa by march during the acquisition of pacificorp by midamerican energy holdings company mehc  mehc committed to install additional pollution control equipment at most of pacificorp s facilities 
this commitment includes so injection  additional low nox burners and scrubber upgrades at the jim bridger plant 
over the next three years  upgrade expenditures are currently estimated at million ipc s share  with total project costs currently estimated at million ipc s share 
in oregon  a demonstration analysis for identified haze sources  utilizing modeling techniques  began in and is currently in progress 
those sources which are determined to cause or contribute to visibility impairment at protected areas will be subject to an rh bart determination 
in january  ipc volunteered to participate in an odeq pilot project that will analyze information about air emissions from the boardman plant to determine the effect on visibility in the region  particularly in wilderness and scenic areas 
the pilot project is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of greenhouse gases ipc continues to monitor and evaluate the possible adoption of national  regional  or state greenhouse gas ghg requirements 
several ghg bills were introduced in the us senate and house of representatives during and national  regional or state ghg requirements  if enacted and applicable  could result in significant costs to ipc to comply with restrictions on carbon dioxide or other ghg emissions 
endangered species in december  the us fish and wildlife service listed several species of fish and five species of snails living within ipc s operating area as threatened or endangered species under the endangered species act 
ipc continues to review and analyze the effect such designation has on its operations and is cooperating with governmental agencies to resolve issues related to these species 
on december   ipc and idaho governor james risch submitted a petition to the us fish and wildlife service to de list the threatened bliss rapids snail 
the petition was supported with data collected by ipc over the past years 
the snail  which lives throughout the middle snake river  springs  and tributaries between niagara springs and king hill  was listed as threatened under the endangered species act in the fish and wildlife service has one year to decide if de listing is warranted 
with this filing  three of the five snail species that are found in the middle snake river and were originally listed as threatened or endangered species in are now being considered for removal from the list 
pursuant to ferc license  ipc owns and finances the operation of anadromous fish hatcheries and related facilities to mitigate the effects of its hydroelectric dams on fish populations 
in connection with its fish facilities  ipc sponsors ongoing programs for the control of fish disease  improvement of fish production  and evaluation of hatchery performance 
ipc s anadromous fish facilities at hells canyon  oxbow  rapid river  pahsimeroi and niagara springs continue to be operated by the idaho department of fish and game 
at december   the investment in these facilities was million and the annual cost of operation was million 
regulatory matters general rate case idaho on may   the ipuc issued an order approving a settlement of ipc s general rate case filed in october the order approves an average increase of percent in base rates  or million in revenues  effective june  ipc s original filing had asked for an annual increase to its idaho retail base rates of million  a percent average increase 
the rate case filing was made with six months of actual operating expenses and six months of projected expenses 
the actual increase in rates was lower than the requested amount due to three factors actual expenses were significantly less than those forecasted  the overall rate of return agreed to was percent compared to the percent ipc requested no specific return on equity was determined  and net power supply costs were kept at levels currently existing in rates 

table of contents ipc expects to file a new general rate case with the ipuc in oregon on september   ipc filed an application with the opuc to increase general rates an average of percent or approximately million annually 
a partial settlement resolved most issues in a manner consistent with the results of the corresponding idaho general rate case 
the most significant issue in this proceeding was the appropriate quantification of net power supply expenses for purposes of setting rates 
the opuc staff proposed that net power supply expenses for ipc be set at a negative number meaning that ipc should be able to sell enough surplus energy to pay for all fuel and purchased power expenses and still have revenue left over to offset other costs 
the bulk of ipc s rebuttal was directed at this position 
a hearing was conducted on may  the opuc issued its order in july authorizing an increase of million in annual revenues for an average of percent 
the opuc adopted the opuc staff s argument for the negative net power supply costs  thus reducing ipc s initial rate request of million by million with this one adjustment 
on september   ipc filed a complaint with the circuit court of marion county  oregon asking the court to reverse the portion of the opuc s general rate case order related to the determination of net power supply costs 
following a full review of the matter  the court denied ipc s reversal request on august  ipc did not appeal the decision 
deferred power supply costs ipc s deferred net power supply costs consisted of the following at december in thousands of dollars idaho pca current year deferral for the rate year accrual for the rate year idaho pca true up awaiting recovery authorized may authorized may oregon deferral costs costs total accrual deferral includes million of emission allowance sales to be credited to the customers during the pca year idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
these adjustments are based on forecasts of net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  and the true up of the prior year s forecast 
during the year  percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs is deferred with interest 
the ending balance of this deferral  called the true up for the current year s portion and the true up of the true up for the prior years unrecovered portion  is then included in the calculation of the next year s pca 
the true up of the true up portion of the pca provides a tracking of the collection or the refund of true up amounts 
each month  the collection or the refund of the true up amount is quantified based upon the true up portion of the pca rate and the consumption of energy by customers 
at the end of the pca year  the total collection or refund is compared to the previously determined amount to be collected or refunded 
any difference between authorized amounts and amounts actually collected or refunded are then reflected in the following pca year  which becomes the true up of the true up 
over time  the actual collection or refund of authorized true up dollars matches the amounts authorized 
on may   the ipuc approved ipc s pca filing with an effective date of june  the filing reduced the pca component of customers rates from the existing level  which was recovering million above then existing base rates  to a level that is million below those base rates  a decrease of approximately million 

table of contents on june   ipc implemented the pca  which held the pca component of customers rates at the existing level recovering million above base rates 
by ipuc order  the pca included million in lost revenues and million in related interest resulting from ipc s irrigation load reduction program that was in place in the pca deferred recovery of approximately million of power supply costs  or percent  for one year to help mitigate the impacts of other rate increases 
the million was included in the pca filing  and ipc earned a two percent carrying charge on the balance 
idaho load growth adjustment rate lgar in april ipc filed a petition with the ipuc requesting modification of one component of its pca referred to as the load growth adjustment rate 
the lgar subtracts the cost of serving new idaho retail customers from the power supply costs ipc is allowed to include in its pca 
the lgar was set at per megawatt hour when the pca began in this amount was established as the projected marginal cost of serving each new customer and is subtracted from each year s pca expense 
in its april petition  ipc requested using the embedded cost of serving the new load rather than the projected marginal cost and to lower the rate to per megawatt hour 
the ipuc staff recommended against changing to the embedded cost approach  ipuc staff also recommended increasing the rate to per megawatt hour 
on january   the ipuc issued its final order in this matter 
the ipuc maintained the marginal cost methodology and set the new lgar at per megawatt hour 
the new rate becomes effective on april  and will first affect customer rates on june  the impact of the new lgar on ipc will ultimately be determined by future load growth 
assuming an average megawatt load growth  the new rate would result in approximately million subtracted from the next pca  a pre tax increase of million over the current amount 
the impact of the new lgar can be partially offset by ipc through more frequent general rate case filings with the ipuc or from less customer growth 
in its order the ipuc stated that it expected ipc to update its load growth adjustment in all future general rate cases 
oregon on april   ipc filed for an accounting order with the opuc to defer net power supply costs for the period of may   through april   in anticipation of higher than normal power supply expenses 
in the oregon general rate case discussed above  normal power supply expenses were set at a negative number meaning that under normal water conditions ipc should be able to sell enough surplus energy to pay for all fuel and purchased power expenses and still have revenue left over to offset other costs 
the forecasted system net power supply expenses included in this deferral filing were million  which is million higher than the normalized power supply expenses established in the oregon general rate case 
ipc requested authorization to defer an estimated million  the oregon jurisdictional share of the million 
ipc also requested that it earn its oregon authorized rate of return on the deferred balance and recover the amount through rates in future years  as approved by the opuc 
the parties met on september   and began negotiating for a pca mechanism for ipc s oregon jurisdiction  and agreed to suspend discussion of the deferral application while the pca negotiations are ongoing 
the parties believe that any agreement regarding a pca mechanism may impact resolution of ipc s deferral application 
the parties met on november  further workshops are planned for  but have not yet been scheduled 
the timing of future recovery of oregon power supply cost deferrals is subject to an oregon statute that specifically limits rate amortizations of deferred costs to six percent per year 
ipc is currently amortizing through rates power supply costs associated with the western energy situation of full recovery of the deferral is not expected until a deferral would have to be amortized sequentially following the full recovery of the deferral 

table of contents on march   ipc filed for an accounting order with the opuc to defer net power supply costs for the period of march  through february   in anticipation of continued low water conditions 
the forecasted net power supply costs included in this filing were million  of which million related to the oregon jurisdiction 
ipc proposed to use the same methodology for this deferral filing that was accepted in for oregon s share of ipc s net power supply expenses 
on july   ipc  the opuc staff  and the citizen s utility board entered into a stipulation requesting that the opuc accept ipc s proposed methodology 
under this methodology  ipc will earn its oregon authorized rate of return on the deferred balance and will recover the amount through rates in future years  as approved by the opuc 
the opuc issued order on july   approving the stipulation 
on april   ipc filed a request for review and acknowledgement of its deferred net power supply costs for the period of march   through february  on june   a settlement conference was held 
on december   ipc responded to additional data requests by the opuc 
the opuc staff subsequently drafted a settlement stipulation under which the parties agree that ipc appropriately deferred approximately million during the deferral period 
the stipulation also provides that  rather than amortizing the deferral into rates  ipc should offset the balance with the oregon jurisdictional share of proceeds from the sale of so emission allowances and the benefit that ipc will receive from income taxes already paid on the sale of those allowances 
when combined  these offsets exceed the deferral balance 
the stipulation was filed with the opuc on january  a final order is expected from the opuc during the first quarter of emission allowances in june  ipc filed applications with the ipuc and opuc requesting blanket authorization for the sale of excess so emission allowances and an accounting order 
the ipuc issued order on august   authorizing the sale and interim accounting treatment 
the opuc issued order on september   stating that ipc did not need a blanket order to sell emission allowances and approved the interim accounting treatment 
in and early  ipc sold  so emission allowances for approximately million before income taxes and expenses on the open market 
after subtracting transaction fees  the total amount of sales proceeds to be allocated to the idaho jurisdiction is approximately million million net of tax  assuming a tax rate of approximately percent 
through allowance year  ipc has approximately  excess allowances 
pursuant to the ipuc order  the ipuc staff held several workshops and settlement discussions 
on may   the ipuc approved a stipulation filed in april by ipc on behalf of several parties 
the stipulation allows ipc to retain ten percent  or approximately million after tax  of the emission allowance net proceeds as a shareholder benefit 
the remaining percent of the sales proceeds million plus a carrying charge will be recorded as a customer benefit and included as a line item in the pca true up 
the carrying charge will be calculated on million  the net of tax amount allocable to idaho jurisdiction customers 
this customer benefit is included in ipc s pca calculations as a credit to the pca true up balance and will be reflected in pca rates during the june  through may  pca rate year 
as discussed above  a stipulation is currently before the opuc which would offset so emission allowance proceeds against the balance of oregon deferred power supply cost 
the stipulation allows for ipc to retain ten percent of the proceeds from emission allowance sales as a shareholder benefit 
fixed cost adjustment mechanism fca on january   ipc filed with the ipuc for authority to implement a rate adjustment mechanism that would adjust rates downward or upward to recover fixed costs independent from the volume of ipc s energy sales 
this filing is a continuation of a case that was opened to investigate the financial disincentives to investment in energy efficiency by ipc 
this true up mechanism would be applicable only to residential and small general service customers 
the first fca rate change under this proposal would occur on june   coincident with ipc s pca rate change 
the accounting for the fca will be separate from the pca 
as part of the filing  ipc proposes a three percent cap on any rate increase to be applied at the discretion of the ipuc 
on march   the ipuc reviewed ipc s proposal and acknowledged the intent of ipc and the ipuc staff to initiate and engage in settlement discussions 
the ipuc staff presented an alternate view of ipc s proposal 
three workshops were held in and the parties have agreed in concept to a three year pilot beginning at the first of the year and a stipulation was filed on december  the stipulation calls for the implementation of a fca mechanism pilot program as proposed by ipc in its original application with additional conditions and provisions related to customer count and weather normalization methodology  recording of the fca deferral amount in reports to the ipuc and detailed reporting of dsm activities 
the pilot program began on january   and will run through  with the first rate adjustment to occur on june   and subsequent rate adjustments to occur on june of each year thereafter during the term of the pilot program 
the deadline for filing written comments with respect to the stipulation and the use of modified procedure was january  a final order is expected from the ipuc in the first quarter of 
table of contents ferc proceedings open access transmission tariff oatt on march   ipc submitted a revised oatt filing with the ferc requesting an increase in transmission rates 
the purpose of the filing was to implement formula rates for the ipc oatt in order to more adequately reflect the costs that ipc incurs in providing transmission service 
in the filing ipc proposed to move from a fixed rate to a formula rate  which allows for transmission rates to be updated each year based on ferc form data 
the formula rate request included a rate of return on equity of percent 
the proposed rates would have produced an annual revenue increase of approximately million based on test year data 
on may   the ferc accepted ipc s rates  effective june   subject to adjustment to conform to fasb tax accounting requirements  which ultimately resulted in lowering the estimated annual revenues to approximately million 
ipc has complied with this directive and on august   the ferc issued an order accepting ipc s compliance filing and ordering that this new rate be used  subject to refund as discussed below 
as a result  ipc has made refunds with interest for june and july amounts billed  and started billing the new rate beginning in august 
the rates are being collected subject to refund pending the outcome of the ferc hearing process scheduled for may with an initial decision expected to be issued in august on november   intervenors filed a motion for partial summary disposition on the issue of how a pre contract with another utility was treated in the rate calculation 
on december   oral argument was heard by the ferc administrative law judge alj 
on december   the alj denied the intervenors motion for partial summary judgment 
ipc is currently preparing rebuttal testimony in this case 
ferc order on february   the ferc adopted a final rule amending the regulations governing its pro forma oatt 
according to the ferc  the purpose of the amendment is to remedy undue discrimination by providing greater specificity in the pro forma oatt and increasing transparency in the rules applicable to planning and the use of the transmission system 
the major reforms to the pro forma oatt relate to i the development of more consistent methodologies and assumptions for calculating available transfer capability atc  ii more open  coordinated and transparent transmission planning  iii reform of the energy and generator imbalances penalties based on a tiered structure  iv adoption of a conditional firm component to long term point to point service requiring transmission providers to identify system conditions  as well as reform of the redispatch service and v reform of the rollover rights policy 
ipc  as a transmission service provider with an oatt on file with the ferc  will be required to comply with these requirements 
certain requirements provided under the final rule  such as the methodology applicable to calculating the atc  will be determined prospectively and make it difficult at this time to determine the effect of the final rule 
however  idacorp and ipc believe that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
cassia wind farm complaint on september   cassia gulch wind park  llc and cassia wind farm  llc collectively cassia filed a complaint against ipc with the ipuc requesting an ipuc declaration and determination that  as a matter of law and policy  the cost responsibility for specified transmission system upgrades to meet contingency planning conditions should not be assigned to purpa qualifying facilities connecting to the system  but rather should be rolled into ipc s plant in service rate base and recovered through rates to retail and transmission customers 
the estimated costs of transmission system upgrades included in this complaint that relate to connecting cassia to ipc s system are million 
cassia requested that the ipuc process its request for an order under modified procedure 
the ipuc staff contends that the policy issue raised by cassia is one of generic consequence and has  therefore  provided copies of cassia s complaint to both pacificorp and avista and recommended that those utilities also be provided the opportunity to address the issue raised by cassia 
initial comments were due october  and reply comments were due november  on november  the ipuc granted cassia s request for oral argument on the threshold issue presented for ipuc determination by cassia  ie  whether a purpa qualifying facility selling generation to a utility has a responsibility to pay the transmission upgrade costs that result from  and that would not be incurred but for  the facility s request for interconnection 
oral arguments were held november  public utility regulatory policies act of as mandated by the enactment of purpa and the adoption of avoided cost rates by the ipuc and the opuc  ipc has entered into contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts  ipc is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside the ipc service territory 
for projects located outside the ipc service territory  ipc is required to purchase the output that ipc has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the ipc system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cogeneration and small power production cspp contracts are fully recovered through the pca 
for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy on a monthly basis are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and the opuc to estimate ipc s cost of developing additional generation resources 
on august   the ipuc granted a temporary reduction in the eligible project size to kw for intermittent generation resources only and ordered ipc to study the impacts of integrating this type of resource 
ipc completed and filed with the ipuc a wind generation integration study report on february  the ipuc will evaluate the proposal  possibly including public workshops  and issue a ruling 

table of contents for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the opuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is recovered through general rate case filings 
the oregon provisions are currently being reviewed in an opuc proceeding 
if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  then ipc is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer of that project 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the ipc system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
recent activities  including the extension of the federal production tax credit and the expansion of the tax credit for eligibility to solar  geothermal and other forms of generation  resolution of ipuc and opuc purpa related hearings and the december  order by the ipuc increasing the published avoided costs  create a favorable climate for purpa project development  which may require ipc to enter into additional purpa agreements 
the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements may result in ipc acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices  thus increasing costs to its customers 
additionally  it is highly likely that the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements will add to ipc s surplus during certain times of the year 
this could also increase costs to ipc s customers 
as of december   ipc had signed agreements to purchase energy from cspp facilities with contracts ranging from one to years 
of these facilities  were on line at the end of  the other facilities under contract are due to come on line in and during  ipc purchased  mwh from these projects at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of cents per kilowatt hour 
integrated resource plan ipc filed its irp with the ipuc in september and with the opuc in october a hearing is scheduled in oregon for june the irp previewed ipc s load and resource situation for the next twenty years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
the two primary goals of the irp were to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy service within ipc s service area throughout the year planning period and ensure that the portfolio of resources selected balances cost  risk and environmental concerns 
in addition  there were four secondary goals to give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures  to involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way  explore transmission alternatives  and investigate and evaluate advanced coal technologies 
the irp is filed every two years with both the ipuc and the opuc 
ipc s irp process utilizes an advisory council consisting of representatives from the ipuc staff  opuc staff  as well as representatives from customer  governmental  environmental and other interested groups and is the starting point for demonstrating prudence in ipc s resource decisions 
the year irp includes the following supply side resources year resource mw wind rfp geothermal rfp combined heat power wind transmission capacity pulverized coal regional integrated gasification combined cycle coal transmission capacity combined heat power geothermal geothermal nuclear the mw of nuclear generation is anticipated to be acquired through a power purchase agreement for output from the idaho national laboratory s planned next generation nuclear project 
ipc has negotiated a power purchase agreement with the successful bidder on the mw wind rfp see wind rfp below 
an rfp for geothermal powered generation was released on june  ipc is in the process of evaluating bids and expects to identify a successful bidder during the first quarter of 
table of contents in addition to the supply side resources identified above  the irp also includes demand side programs designed to reduce average energy needs by mw and peak hour needs by mw 
to reach these totals  existing demand side programs will be expanded and new programs will be implemented over the year planning period 
coal fired resource screening and evaluation in the irp  ipc identified the need for a coal fired resource beginning in as a result of discussions with potential resource participants  ipc and spokane  washington based avista utilities entered into an agreement to jointly investigate possible future coal fired resources 
under the arrangement  the utilities are studying the options for base load coal fired generation to meet their collective irp forecast needs 
information submittals from interested parties were received in october and ipc and avista are currently in the process of evaluating and screening potential projects 
in addition  ipc continues to evaluate other coal fired resource opportunities  including expansion of its jointly owned facilities 
wind rfp elkhorn wind project a contract with telocaset wind power partners  llc  a subsidiary of horizon wind energy  for mw nameplate of wind generation from the elkhorn wind project was signed and filed with the ipuc on december  ipc requested the costs associated with the elkhorn project be included in ipc s annual pca 
the ipuc approved the application on february  peaking resource on december   ipc received a certificate of convenience and necessity to construct a turnkey siemens power generation combustion turbine at the evander andrews power complex near mountain home  idaho 
the certificate of convenience and necessity included a commitment estimate of million and approval for ipc to include in rate base the prudent capital costs for construction and operating fuel costs 
the turbine will provide approximately mw of capacity during summer load peaks and up to mw during the winter 
commercial operation is planned for spring related transmission interconnection and line upgrades will be constructed by ipc at an estimated cost of million 
ipuc review of new purpa standards the ipuc initiated a project in june to assess implementation of the energy policy act of the act amended the public utility regulatory policies act of and added five new federal ratemaking standards for public utilities and requires state regulatory commissions to determine whether they should adopt the standards for public utilities in their jurisdictions 
the five new standards relate to net metering  fuel source diversity  fossil fuel generation efficiency  time based metering and communication  and interconnection services to customers with on site generating facilities 
in july  the ipuc requested that each utility respond to questions about the proposed standards 
a public workshop was held in september after evaluating the responses  the ipuc determined that  with the exception of time based metering  all of the standards had already been adopted 
the ipuc declined to adopt the time based metering standard 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex and swan falls projects  a process that may continue for the next ten to fifteen years 
ipc s middle snake river project licenses were issued in hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hells canyon complex hcc  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generating capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
the current license for the hcc expired at the end of july until the new multi year license is issued  ipc will operate the project under an annual license issued by the ferc 
ipc developed the license application for the hcc through a collaborative process involving representatives of state and federal agencies and business  environmental  tribal  customer  local government and local landowner interests 
the license application was filed in july and accepted by the ferc for filing in december 
table of contents on october   the ferc issued its notice of ready for environmental analysis  which requires the federal and state agencies  native american tribes and other participants in the relicensing process to file preliminary comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions under the fpa  the national environmental policy act of  as amended nepa  the energy policy act and other applicable federal laws 
nepa requires that the ferc independently evaluate the environmental effects of relicensing the hcc as proposed under the final license application the proposed action and also consider reasonable alternatives to the proposed action 
consistent with the requirements of nepa  the ferc staff will prepare an environmental impact statement eis for the hells canyon project  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the eis will describe and evaluate the probable effects  if any  of the proposed action and the other alternatives considered 
section of the energy policy act modifies the existing hydroelectric relicensing process under the fpa and requires federal resource agencies with authority to impose mandatory conditions on licenses under sections e or of the fpa conditions that the ferc must include in the license to provide license applicants  and other parties to the licensing process  with evidentiary hearings on disputed issues of material fact related to proposed conditions 
it also requires that such agencies accept more cost effective alternative conditions proposed by license applicants  or other parties  provided that the proposed alternative conditions will be no less protective of the resource or the reservation than the original condition recommended by the agency 
the federal and state agencies  native american tribes and other interested parties filed their preliminary comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions with the ferc on january  consistent with the provisions of the fpa  ipc filed reply comments to these filings on april  federal agencies with mandatory conditioning authority under sections e and of the fpa also filed their preliminary terms and conditions under those sections with the ferc on january  the energy policy act  and the interim final rules issued on november   to implement the act  require ipc  within days of the agency s filing of their preliminary terms and conditions with the ferc  to file requests for evidentiary hearings on disputed issues of material fact relied upon by the federal agency for support of any term or condition and also file any proposed alternative conditions 
on february   ipc filed requests for hearing on section e conditions filed by the department of the interior through the bureau of land management blm and the department of agriculture through the u 
s 
forest service usfs 
ipc also filed proposed alternative conditions with the agencies 
the hearing requests related to travel and access management  law enforcement and emergency services  and recreation and land management conditions proposed by the blm  and sediment supply and sandbar maintenance and restoration  wildlife habitat mitigation and management  noxious weed control  recreation resource management  and cultural resource management conditions filed by the usfs 
each of the agencies responded to the hearing requests and referred the requests to the hearings division within the respective agencies for assignment to an alj 
hearings were subsequently set before a department of interior alj for june   on the requests for hearing on the blm conditions and a department of agriculture alj for june   on the usfs requests for hearing 
while ipc was preparing for the evidentiary hearings  ipc continued to engage in discussions with the respective agencies regarding possible settlements 
through these discussions  ipc was able to resolve the disputed issues associated with the pending hearing requests 
on may   ipc and the usfs filed a stipulation with the department of agriculture alj  and revised preliminary terms and conditions with the ferc  resolving all issues associated with the pending usfs hearing requests except for the issues associated with the usfs condition relating to sediment supply and sandbar maintenance 
these issues remained subject to hearing on june  on may   ipc and the blm filed a stipulation with the department of interior alj and revised preliminary terms and conditions with the ferc resolving all issues associated with the pending blm hearing requests 
through subsequent settlement discussions with the usfs  ipc resolved all disputed issues associated with the hearing request on the usfs condition relating to sediment supply and sandbar maintenance 
all of these hearing requests were resolved through stipulations between ipc and the usfs and blm  respectively  providing for the withdrawal of ipc s requests for hearing and the filing of revised preliminary terms and conditions with the ferc with provisions that were acceptable to ipc 

table of contents on july   the ferc released the draft eis  and comments were due november  the draft eis is prepared by the ferc staff  pursuant to nepa and applicable federal regulations  to inform the ferc commissioners  the public  state and federal agencies and the tribes about the potential adverse and beneficial environmental effects of licensing of the project as proposed by the ipc in its license application and provide a review of other reasonable alternatives or measures that might be included in a license for the project 
based upon the draft eis  the subsequent comments received  the license application and other material in the ferc record  the ferc commissioners will decide whether to license the hcc and what conditions to include in the license to address project effects 
however  because this is a draft eis  containing only ferc staff conclusions  it cannot be relied upon to accurately predict what measures will be included in the final eis or the outcome of the relicensing process 
in connection with the issuance of the draft eis  the ferc held public meetings in boise  weiser and lewiston  idaho and halfway  oregon from september through september   to take public comments on the draft eis 
transcripts of the public meetings are filed in the ferc record 
the ferc will consider these comments  in addition to the written comments received by november   in connection with the preparation of the final eis 
on november   ipc filed comments with the ferc on the draft eis 
in large measure  the ferc staff adopted the protection  mitigation and enhancement measures proposed by ipc in its final license application 
with regard to the following issues  the ferc staff took the following action rejected an anadromous fish habitat restoration fund of million per year on the basis that it has no nexus to the project  rejected operational and ramp rate restrictions below hells canyon dam on the basis that sufficient information is available to determine that the aquatic community below the project is not being adversely affected by operations  rejected an  cfs navigation flow below the hcc on the basis that the alleged benefits to navigation were not worth the substantial reduction in power benefits associated with the increased flows  and accepted ipc s proposal to acquire  enhance and manage approximately  acres as appropriate on site  in kind mitigation for the effects of project operations on upland and riparian habitat 
while ipc concurred with many of staff s conclusions in the draft eis  ipc did provide comments on certain portions of the draft eis 
other parties also submitted comments on the draft eis 
ipc is now reviewing those comments to determine whether additional submittals to the ferc are necessary in response to those comments 
the ferc is now in the process of reviewing the comments to the draft eis and has advised that its preliminary schedule for the release of a final eis is may on august   the ferc requested formal consultation with the national marine fisheries service nmfs  pursuant to section of the endangered species act esa  advising the nmfs that the ferc staff  in the draft eis  had concluded that the licensing of the hcc was likely to adversely affect the snake river fall chinook salmon threatened species  snake river spring summer chinook salmon threatened species  snake river sockeye salmon endangered species and snake river steelhead threatened species  along with the critical habitat for these species 
on september   nmfs sent a letter to the ferc advising that the draft eis did not meet the information requirements for initiation of formal consultation under section of the esa because the draft eis did not fully describe the action alternative that was to be subject to consultation 
the nfms advised that several processes were still underway that may affect the action alternative  including the section j process under the federal power act  the outcome of the section certification process under the clean water act that is pending before the departments of environmental quality of idaho and oregon  and discussions with ipc intended to craft measures to address esa issues 
for these reasons nmfs suggested that consultation should be initiated at a later time 
nmfs suggested that nmfs  usfws and ipc work cooperatively to address esa issues as the nepa process continues so as to assure that the licensing process is not delayed due to esa consultation 
on august   the ferc requested formal consultation with the usfws  pursuant to section of the esa  advising the usfws that the ferc staff  in the draft eis  had concluded that the licensing of the hcc was likely to adversely affect the bull trout threatened species and its critical habitat and the bald eagle threatened species 
on august   the usfws sent a letter to the ferc advising that the draft eis did not meet the information requirements for initiation of formal consultation under section of the esa because the draft eis did not fully describe the action alternative that was to be subject to consultation 
the usfws advised the ferc that elements relating to a new license were still under development in processes involving ipc and state and federal agencies  one such process being section certification under the clean water act  which is currently pending before the departments of environmental quality of idaho and oregon 
the usfws further advised that it was also still in the process of preparing comments to the draft eis and that the ferc had yet to complete the processes necessary under the federal power act with regard to the federal agencies section j recommendations 
for these reasons  the usfws suggested that the usfws  the nmfs  and ipc work cooperatively to address esa issues as the nepa process continues so as to assure that the licensing process is not delayed due to esa consultation 
in early december  in connection with scheduled meetings between the ferc and the usfws and the nmfs on section j recommendations  the ferc  the usfws  the nmfs and ipc met and conferred on pending esa issues 
at the conclusion of that meeting  the ferc advised that it intended to schedule a conference call in early to further discuss esa issues 
the ferc has not yet scheduled that conference call 
ipc is cooperating with the usfws  the nmfs and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns associated with the licensing of the hcc

regional transmission organizations over the last several years  ipc has spent funds supporting the development of grid west  a regional transmission organization rto 
through the fourth quarter of  ipc had loaned grid west million and had accumulated million of costs in a deferred expense account  anticipating future recovery through grid west tariffs 
the deferred expenses were direct expenses incurred in the development of grid west that were deferred based on a accounting order that ipc received from the ferc 
ipc ceased funding grid west following the dissolution of grid west on april  ipc no longer expects reimbursement of either amount from grid west 
in april  ipc filed requests with the ipuc and opuc to recover through retail rates the amounts loaned to grid west and the deferred expenses related to the development of grid west 
on august   the opuc issued an order granting ipc s recovery of the grid west loans  however  they denied ipc s request to recover the deferred amounts 
on october   the ipuc issued an order allowing ipc to recover the principal portion of the grid west loans over a five year amortization beginning january  the ipuc disallowed the recovery of the deferred amounts and the interest portion of the grid west loans 
as a result of these orders  ipc recognized an impairment of million in the fourth quarter of for the disallowance of the deferred amounts and a regulatory asset of million for the recovery of the grid west loan amounts 
northern tier transmission group ipc  along with four other utilities covering all or parts of the transmission system in six western states  has formed the northern tier transmission group nttg 
the goal of the group is to improve overall operation and expansion of the high voltage transmission network 
nttg held its first meeting in november the group has begun three initial activities improving generation control performance  providing improved information on available transmission capacity  and facilitating open  participatory transmission planning 
goals of the group include compliance with the new ferc order 
table of contents ferc market based rate authority ipc has ferc approved market based rate authority  which permits ipc to sell electric energy at market based rates rather than cost based rates 
every three years  the ferc requires a review of the conditions under which this market based rate authority is granted to ensure that the rates charged thereunder are just and reasonable 
on april   the ferc issued an order commencing a market power analysis of all companies with market based rate authority  including ipc 
in september  ipc filed a revision of its market power analysis based on data  which it supplemented in september and october on march   the ferc issued an order accepting ipc s market power analysis 
ipc is required to file another market power analysis on or before march  on may  ipc filed a notice of change in status in accordance with ferc requirements to report the addition of bennett mountain power plant  which ipc acquired on march  the purpose of the filing is to explain whether  and if so  how  the addition of bennett mountain reflects a departure from the characteristics the ferc relied on when it authorized ipc to make sales at market based rates 
the may filing included an updated generation market power study that utilized original data as well as pertinent data 
the results showed that  with the addition of bennett mountain  ipc still passed both of the ferc s market power screens in all relevant control areas 
on december   the ferc staff requested that ipc perform a complete generation market power study for the ipc control area using data 
ipc filed a revised study with the ferc on february  the ferc accepted ipc s notice on june  confirming that ipc passed the market power analysis screens and maintained market based rate authority 
other matters adopted accounting pronouncements sfas r effective january   idacorp and ipc adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
prior to adopting sfas r  the companies accounted for stock based employee compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
in and  total stock based employee compensation expense recorded was less than million annually 
idacorp and ipc did not modify outstanding stock options prior to the adoption of sfas r  and the fair value estimation model for options did not differ significantly 
since  idacorp and ipc have granted a mix of performance restricted stock  time vesting restricted stock and stock options 
in  idacorp and ipc granted cumulative earnings per share and total shareholder return based performance shares  and time vesting restricted stock and granted only a minimal amount of stock options 
the adoption of sfas r did not have a material effect on idacorp s and ipc s financial statements  and  based on current levels of awards  is not expected to have a material effect in the future

table of contents sab in september  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
prior practice allowed the evaluation of materiality on the basis of the error quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement was misstated rollover method or the cumulative error quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet was misstated iron curtain method 
reliance on either method in prior years could have resulted in misstatement of the financial statements 
the guidance provided in sab requires both methods to be used in evaluating materiality 
immaterial prior year errors may be corrected with the first filing of prior year financial statements after adoption 
the cumulative effect of the correction would be reflected in the opening balance sheet with appropriate disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error corrected in the cumulative adjustment  as well as a disclosure of the cause of the error and that the error had been deemed to be immaterial in the past 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on idacorp s or ipc s financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements see note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
inflation idacorp and ipc believe that inflation has caused and will continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and the replacement of assets at higher costs 
inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance costs and capital improvements 
while inflation has not had a significant impact on idacorp s or ipc s operations  costs for products and services are subject to increases 
ipc is subject to rate of return regulation and the impact of inflation on the level of cost recovery under regulation 
increases in utility costs and expenses due to inflation could have an adverse effect on earnings because of the need to obtain regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity though a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had million and million  respectively  in floating rate debt  net of temporary investments 
assuming no change in either company s financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher than the average rate on december   interest expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had outstanding fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively  and the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate  and therefore do not expose idacorp or ipc to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility ipc s exposure to changes in commodity price is related to its ongoing utility operations producing electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and price of production 
the objective of ipc s energy purchase and sale activity is to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 

table of contents ipc s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the previously discussed pca mechanism 
ipc has adopted a risk management program designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
this program has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc 
ipc s energy risk management policy the policy describes a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the idacorp board of directors  and to the cag 
the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan and orders risk mitigating actions dictated by the limits stated in the policy 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
ipc representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc and other equity investments at ipc 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
