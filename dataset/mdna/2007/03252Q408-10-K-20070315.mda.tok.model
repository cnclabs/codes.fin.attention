overview anadys pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule medicines for the treatment of hepatitis and cancer 
our current clinical development programs include ana  an oral prodrug of the toll like receptor tlr agonist isatoribine for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv and hepatitis b virus hbv  which we are co developing with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd  a novartis ag company novartis  and ana for the treatment of hbv  which we are co developing with lg life sciences lgls 
in addition  we are independently developing ana  an oral tlr prodrug agonist for the treatment of certain cancers and plan to file an investigational new drug ind application in the second half of we are also are developing an  a series of non nucleoside nsb polymerase inhibitors  for the treatment of chronic hcv infection  and anticipate nominating a compound from a sub series of this program anax in to develop as an orally administered drug 
our therapeutic focus in hepatitis and cancer leverages our core capabilities in toll like receptor tlr biology and small molecule medicinal chemistry  and aims to advance a balanced and strong pipeline of drug candidates into the clinic 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we fund our portion of the global development costs of ana for the treatment of hbv  fund our portion of the global development of ana for the treatment of hcv and hbv  continue the development of ana for the treatment of certain cancers  continue the development of anax for the treatment of hcv  continue the development of our other product candidates  advance our preclinical candidates into clinical development  develop and scale up manufacturing of product candidates for clinical trials and potential commercialization  further our research and development programs  establish a commercial infrastructure  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and potentially in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are synergistic with our own 

table of contents on june   we announced that we had suspended dosing hcv patients in our then ongoing phase ib clinical trial with ana pending additional analysis of then newly obtained information from pre clinical week toxicology studies in animals 
preliminary analysis of this information revealed various new observations which appear consistent with intense immune stimulation in animals 
subsequent to our decision to suspend dosing  we received notification from the food and drug administration fda that our ind for ana is on full clinical hold 
together with novartis we have initiated a new week pre clinical toxicology study during november we believe this study should provide information necessary to further our objective to resume dosing of ana in patients with hcv 
on june   kleanthis g 
xanthopoulos phd provided notice of his resignation as our president and chief executive officer which became effective upon the appointment of lawrence c 
fritz  phd as our new president and chief executive officer on november  in conjunction with dr 
xanthopoulos resignation  we agreed to accelerate in full all of dr 
xanthopoulos unvested stock options 
we calculated the additional share based expense associated with the modification and acceleration of his unvested stock options upon his termination in accordance with sfas r 
dr 
xanthopoulos continues to serve as a member of our board of directors 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery and preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidates  ana  ana  ana and anax  and our other product candidates 
research and development expenses include direct external costs such as fees paid to consultants  joint development collaboration costs and related contract research  and internal direct and indirect costs such as compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation 
under our existing collaboration with novartis for the development of ana  novartis funds of the development costs and we fund of such development costs 
reimbursements of development costs for ana from novartis are recorded as an offset to research and development expense 
payments to novartis for its portion of development costs for ana are recorded as a component of research and development expense 
for the years ended december  and  we have recorded as offsets to research and development expense million and million  respectively  which represents novartis share of ana expenses incurred by us from june  through december  as we progress through the development plan for ana  more responsibility for the clinical trials will transition from us to novartis  with reimbursement for research and development expenditures then flowing from us to novartis 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our lead compounds  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we move other product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials and advance our existing product candidates into later stages of development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are currently focused primarily on advancing the development of ana as a potential therapy for hcv and hbv infection  ana as a potential therapy for the treatment of certain cancers  ana as a potential therapy of hbv and discovery of inhibitors of the nsb polymerase as potential therapies for hcv infection 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a project costing methodology which enabled us to allocate internal direct costs such as personnel costs  supplies and materials directly to projects for periods after january  facility costs  depreciation and amortization  research and development support personnel and other indirect personnel related costs are included as a component of infrastructure and support personnel 

table of contents the following summarizes our research and development expenses based on the project costing methodology described above for the year ended december  in thousands ana ana ana discovery stage programs infrastructure and support personnel non cash employee and non employee share based compensation reimbursement of ana costs by novartis total research and development expense prior to january   we allocated only direct external costs such as fees paid to consultants  joint development collaboration costs and related contract research to projects 
other costs such as internal direct and indirect costs which included compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation were not allocated directly to projects 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and in thousands for the years ended december  direct external costs isatoribine family of compounds  excluding ana ana ana ana other unallocated direct internal costs unallocated indirect internal costs and overhead reimbursement of ana costs by novartis deferred compensation total research and development general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  finance  investor relations  business development  human resources and legal personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include insurance costs  professional services and an allocated portion of facilities costs and information systems support personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis and make adjustments to the financials statements as considered necessary 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies involve the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we may receive payments from collaborators for compound licenses  technology access fees  option fees  research services  milestones and royalty obligations 
these payments are recognized as revenue or reported as deferred revenue until they meet the criteria for revenue recognition as outlined in staff accounting bulletin  no 
 revenue recognition  which provides 
table of contents guidance on revenue recognition in financial statements  and is based on the interpretations and practices developed by the sec  and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services were rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
specifically  we have applied the following policies in recognizing revenue revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at the comparable level and iii the milestone is not refundable or creditable 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront fees under our collaborations  such as technology access fees  are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
non refundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
fees that we receive for research services are generally recognized as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
research services may include activities in which we deploy our internal capabilities such as our medicinal chemistry and screening capabilities to assist a collaborator in advancing their drug discovery effort 
drug development costs 
we review and accrue drug development costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on subject enrollment  estimated timeline for completion of studies and other events 
these costs and estimates vary based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial and the length of dose period for each subject as well as other factors 
drug development costs are subject to revisions as trials and studies progress to completion 
expense is adjusted for revisions in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by a black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense evenly over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method on january  under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date of sfas no 
r  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements for sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
prior to adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recorded estimated compensation expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to apb no 
in conjunction with our initial public offering ipo  we reviewed our historical exercise prices through march  and  as a result  revised our estimate for financial reporting purposes of fair value for stock options granted on or after july  through the date of our ipo 
with respect to these options  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the original exercise price per share determined by the board of directors and our revised estimate of fair value per share at the respective grant dates 
we recorded these amounts as a component of stockholders equity and were amortizing these amounts  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
upon the adoption of and in accordance with sfas no 
r  on january   we reclassified our remaining unamortized deferred compensation balance calculated in accordance with apb no 
into additional paid in capital 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by the company in we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards required or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenue 
we recorded revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily attributed to our collaboration with novartis and to a lesser extent our collaboration with roche and our phase ii sbir grant from the national institutes of health 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded revenues of million and million  respectively  associated with the amortization of our million up front payment and million ind milestone payment from novartis 
the up front payment and the ind milestone payment are both being amortized over the estimated development period for ana which is concurrent with the period during which we have significant performance obligations under the collaboration 
the expected duration of this estimated development period is reviewed on a periodic basis 
this increase in revenue was offset by a decrease in revenue from our collaboration with roche 
we recorded revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  from our collaboration with roche 
in january  we completed our portion of our collaboration with roche 
during the years ended december  and we recorded revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our phase ii sbir grant 
during the year ended december   we concluded our performance under the phase ii sbir grant 
the million increase from to was primarily attributed to revenues derived from our collaborations with novartis and roche 
during  we recorded revenues of million associated with the amortization of our million up front payment and million ind milestone payment which were received from novartis in july and september  respectively 
we recorded revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to our collaboration with roche which we entered into effective july  fluctuations in our collaboration related revenue from period to period are expected  as amounts recognized are dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to  the timing of agreements  the timing of the workflow under the agreements  our collaborators abilities to provide us with the materials and information necessary for us to conduct our portion of the collaboration effort and the occurrence of events that may trigger milestone payments to us 
we expect our revenues to continue to fluctuate in future periods as we continue to enter into new agreements and perform activities under existing agreements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january  and an increase in personnel related expenses 
we included  as a component of research and development expense during the year ended december   million of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r 
during the year ended december   we included million as a component of research and development expense with respect to amortization of deferred compensation on employee stock options in accordance with apb no 
personnel related expenses increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this expense was driven by an overall increase in research and development personnel 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to the recording of million as an offset to research and development expense during the year ended december   which represented novartis share of ana expenses incurred by us from june  through december  in addition  deferred compensation on employee stock options determined in accordance with apb no 
decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  
table of contents these decreases were offset by increased costs associated with the development of ana  including clinical trial costs and costs associated with compound manufacturing and safety studies as well as research and development expenses associated with other programs during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily the result of our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january  and to a lesser extent an increase in personnel and recruiting expenses 
we included  as a component of general and administrative expense during the year ended december   million of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r 
included as a component of share based compensation expense was million of share based expense related to the stock options granted to dr 
xanthopoulos including the share based compensation associated with the acceleration of his unvested stock options 
during the year ended december   we included million as a component of general and administrative expense with respect to amortization of deferred compensation on employee stock options in accordance with apb no 
the million decrease from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in deferred compensation on employee stock options determined in accordance with apb no 
this decrease was offset by the following i an increase in personnel and recruiting expenses of million  ii an increase in consultant costs associated with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act and iii an increase in our directors and officers insurance premium as a result of our initial public offering which was completed in march interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in our interest income from to was the result of a higher average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balance during compared to and a result of higher interest rates 
our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the higher average cash balances were driven by the receipt of the following amounts which were invested into interest bearing securities during an up front license payment of million from novartis in july  million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  from our follow on public offering of common stock in august and a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda received in september the million increase in our interest income from to was the result of the receipt of the above amounts which were invested into interest bearing securities during our average balance of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale was million in compared to million in interest expense 
interest expense was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in our interest expense of million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is the result of our payment in full of our outstanding principle balance of million on our equipment financing line of credit in february liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities decreased by million from december  to december  which represents the use of our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale to fund our operations during the year ended december  and the payment in full of our outstanding principal balance of million on our equipment financing line of credit 
this decrease in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale includes the receipt of million from novartis which represented novartis share of ana development costs 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities purchase of securities available for sale proceeds from sale of securities available for sale purchase of property and equipment proceeds from disposal of property and equipment acquisition of facility leasehold improvements from lease incentive net cash provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in provided by operating activities decreased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of the receipt of the up front license payment of million from novartis in july and the receipt in september of a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda during the year ended december  also contributing to the fluctuation in our cash flows provided by used in operating activities during the year ended december  to the year ended december  was the fluctuation in our accounts receivable balance as a result of the timing of payments from novartis associated with their portion or our development costs associated with ana and the reduction in development costs associated with ana as a result of the halting of our phase i clinical trial in june as of december   we had included million from novartis in our accounts receivable balance for their portion of development costs for the period june  through december  this amount was paid during in comparison  we have included million due from novartis in our accounts receivable balance as of december  for their portion of development costs for the period july  through december  the overall decrease in the accounts receivable balance reflects a reduction in spending on the ana project as a result of the halting of our phase i clinical trial for ana cash flows provided by used in operating activities increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue attributable to the receipt of the up front license payment of million from novartis in july and the receipt in september of a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda 
the up front license payment of million and the million ind milestone payment are being recognized as revenue over the estimated development period for ana cash flows provided by used in investing activities decreased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the overall reduction in the cash flows provided by used in investing activities from to is primarily related to the company shifting its investment portfolio from investments with maturities over three months  to investments with maturities less than three months 
during as investments classified as available for sale matured  the proceeds from these securities were either used to fund operations of the company or the proceeds were reinvested in investments classified as cash equivalents to take advantage of their shorter maturity terms 
during and  the company continued to invest in investments with shorter maturities to take advantage of the rising interest rate environment 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities increased by million from to the increase was primarily the result of the investment in securities available for sale of million from our initial public offering during the year ended december  offset by the use of the proceeds from our initial public offering and maturity of securities available for sale during the year ended december  to fund our on going operations 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in thousands cash provided by financing activities proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan proceeds from sale of common stock  net of issuance costs proceeds from long term debt principal payments on long term debt net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows used in financing activities decreased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of the receipt of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  from our follow on public offering of common stock completed during august cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to the increase was primarily a result of the receipt of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs from our follow on public offering of common stock completed during august  as compared to the receipt of million from our initial public offering completed during march and april aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than to to contractual obligations total year thereafter operating leases milestone payments minimum royalty commitment we are in the process of finalizing our joint global development plan for ana with lgls 
assuming that we jointly decide to initiate a phase iib dose selection clinical trial  we may be required to pay million to lgls at the initiation of the phase iib dose selection clinical trial 
we may also be required to pay an additional million to lgls  subject to the attainment of product development and commercialization objectives 
these additional milestone payments have not been included in this contractual obligations table as we are unable to estimate when  if ever  these payments will be made as they are contingent upon the results of our future clinical trials including our phase iib dose selection clinical trial 
we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations that conduct our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the number of subjects enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
to date  the majority of our clinical costs have been related to the costs of subjects entering our clinical trials as well as the manufacturing of compounds to be used in our clinical trials 
costs associated with clinical trials will continue to vary as the trials go through their natural phases of enrollment and follow up 
our portion of the costs will also be influenced by the pace and timing of the development activities conducted under our joint development agreements with our collaborators  including novartis and lgls 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs we will incur in the continued development of our clinical candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current product development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
as we continue our discovery  pre clinical and clinical programs  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which currently un partnered product candidates will be subject to future partnering  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our drug candidates 

table of contents future cash requirements we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the advancement of our development programs 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our preclinical development activities  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the pace and timing of development activities conducted under joint development agreements with our collaborators  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana  ana  ana or any other product candidates we may develop  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
in connection with our collaboration with lgls for the development of ana  we may be required to make milestone payments totalling up to million  subject to the attainment of product development and commercialization objectives 
we will pay royalties on any product sales in our sales territory to lgls and will receive royalties on any product sales in china from lgls 
in connection with our license and co development agreement with novartis for the development of ana and potentially additional tlr oral prodrugs for chronic hcv and hbv infections  as well as other potential infectious disease indications  we may receive up to million in additional payments for the achievement of specified development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  novartis will fund of the global development costs of the lead product candidate  and we will fund of such development costs  subject to certain limitations 
as we progress through the development plan for ana  more operational responsibility for the clinical trials will transition from us to novartis with reimbursement for research and development expenditures then flowing from us to novartis 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and securities available for sale and revenues we may generate from our current collaborations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next fiscal year 
we expect to incur substantial expenses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we continue to review our programs and resource requirements 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and cash receipts from collaboration 
table of contents agreements 
in addition  we likely will need to finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements  project financing and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and securities available for sale resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
