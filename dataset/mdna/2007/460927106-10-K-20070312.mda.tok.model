item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report on form k 
at december   intervest bancshares corporation had two wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries  intervest national bank and intervest mortgage corporation hereafter referred to collectively as the company on a consolidated basis 
intervest bancshares corporation and intervest national bank may be referred to individually as the holding company and the bank  respectively 
the holding company also had four wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v  which were formed in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities 
in october  the limited operations of intervest securities corporation  another wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company  were discontinued and its net assets were distributed to the holding company 
for a discussion of the company s business  see the section entitled item business in this report 
the company s revenues are derived from interest  dividends and fees earned on its interest earning assets  which are comprised of mortgage loans  securities and other short term investments  and noninterest income 
the company s expenses consist of interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  which are comprised of deposits  debentures and other short term borrowings  as well as its operating and general expenses 
the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from its interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is affected by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and expenses  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
noninterest income consists mostly of loan and other banking fees as well as income from loan prepayments 
when a mortgage loan is repaid prior to maturity  the company may recognize prepayment income  which consists of the recognition of unearned fees associated with such loans at the time of payoff and the receipt of additional prepayment fees and or interest in certain cases  in accordance with the prepayment provisions of the mortgage loan 
the company s income from loan prepayments fluctuates and cannot be predicted 
normally  loan prepayments tend to increase during periods of declining interest rates and tend to decrease during periods of increasing interest rates 
however  given the nature and type of the mortgage loans the company originates  including their short average life  the company may still experience loan prepayments notwithstanding the effects of movements in interest rates 
noninterest expenses consist of the following compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  advertising  professional fees  fdic and general insurance and other operating and general expenses 
the company s profitability is also significantly affected by general and local economic conditions  competition  changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate properties including rental and cooperative condominium apartment buildings  office buildings  mixed use properties  shopping centers  hotels  restaurants  industrial properties  parking lots garages and vacant land 
the loans have an average life of approximately three years 
the company tends to lend in areas that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped  with a concentration of loans on properties located in new york state and the state of florida 
a significant portion of the residential properties are located in new york city and are subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents  which in turn may affect the borrower s ability to repay those mortgage loans 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis herein is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in the company s financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
among the more significant policies of the company are those that govern accounting for loans and the allowance for loan losses 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in its financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
the company believes that currently its only significant critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about future loan chargeoffs 
the impact of a sudden large chargeoff could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect the company s earnings and financial position 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment as to the estimated losses that may result from defaults in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the following factors i the size of the loan portfolio  which has experienced rapid growth and increased individual loan balances  ii the nature of the loan portfolio  which is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate properties  including some vacant properties and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties  while loans on vacant properties and vacant land typically do not have income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment  iii specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties  iv historical chargeoffs and recoveries  v adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and vi management s perception of the current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s lending areas  which are concentrated in new york and florida 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions  or other factors  differ from those previously assumed in the determination of the level of the allowance 
the company s allowance for loan losses is comprised of an unallocated portion which is derived from an estimated loss factor currently ranging from to multiplied by the principal amount of loans rated acceptable  and higher percentages for loans that are assigned a credit grade of special mention or lower and  from time to time  an allocated or specific portion on certain loans  particularly for loans that have been identified as being impaired 

table of contents statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both full principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
the company s policy is to charge off any portion of the recorded investment in the loan that exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis 
finally  the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination 
comparison of financial condition at december  and overview selected balance sheet information by entity as of december  follows in thousands holding company intervest national bank intervest mortgage corporation inter company amounts consolidated cash and cash equivalents security investments loans receivable  net of deferred fees allowance for loan losses investment in consolidated subsidiaries all other assets total assets deposits borrowed funds and related interest payable all other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
such amounts arise largely from intercompany deposit accounts and investments in subsidiaries 

table of contents a comparison of the consolidated balance sheets follows at december  at december  in thousands carrying value of total assets carrying value of total assets cash and cash equivalents security investments loans receivable  net of deferred fees and loan loss allowance all other assets total assets deposits borrowed funds and related interest payable all other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december   from million at december   due to a lower level of overnight federal funds investments 
cash and cash equivalents also include interest bearing and noninterest bearing cash balances with banks  and other short term investments that have original maturities of three months or less  which are normally comprised of commercial paper and certificates of deposit issued by large commercial banks 
the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  calls of securities  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative investment opportunities 
security investments securities are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when management has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such investments  which are held by the bank  increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase reflected new purchases exceeding maturities and calls during the period 
the bank continues to invest mainly in short term up to year maturities us government agency debt obligations to emphasize liquidity and to target its loan to deposit ratio at approximately 
this ratio stood at at december  during  the bank selectively purchased a number of corporate securities  consisting of trust preferred notes  to enhance yield 
at december   nearly all of the held to maturity portfolio consisted of short term debt obligations of the federal home loan bank  federal farm credit bank  federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation with a weighted average yield of and a weighted average remaining maturity of years  compared to and years  respectively  at december  nearly all of the securities have fixed rates of interest or have predetermined scheduled rate increases  and many have call features that allow the issuer to call the security before its stated maturity without penalty 
at december  and  the held to maturity portfolio s estimated fair value was million and million  respectively 
at december   the held to maturity portfolio had net unrealized losses totaling million  compared to million of net unrealized losses at december  management believes that the cause of the unrealized losses is directly related to changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  their fair value will increase 
management views the unrealized losses to be temporary based on the impact of changes in interest rates  the very short maturities of the investments and their high credit quality 
in addition  the bank has the ability and intent to hold its investments for a period of time sufficient for the fair value of the securities to recover  which may be at maturity 
historically  the bank has always recovered the cost of its investment securities upon maturity 

table of contents in order for the bank to be a member of the federal reserve bank frb and the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb  the bank maintains an investment in their capital stock  which amounted to million and million  respectively  at december  the frb stock has historically paid a dividend of  while the fhlb stock dividend fluctuates and most recently was

loans receivable  net of deferred fees and allowance for loan losses loans receivable  net of deferred fees and the allowance for loan losses  increased to billion at december   from billion at december  the growth reflected new mortgage loan originations secured by commercial and multifamily real estate exceeding principal repayments 
new loan originations totaled million in  compared to million in  of which the bank s originations were million in compared to million in  and intervest mortgage corporation s originations were million in compared to million in nearly all of the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate properties including rental and cooperative condominium apartment buildings  office buildings  mixed use properties  shopping centers  hotels  restaurants  industrial properties  parking lots garages and vacant land 
at december   such loans consisted of loans with an aggregate principal balance of billion and an average principal size of million 
loans with principal balances of million or more aggregated to loans or million  with the largest loan amounting to million 
nonaccrual loans at december  totaled million and were comprised of two multifamily real estate loans 
foreclosure actions have been commenced for nonpayment 
in september  the company received full principal repayment of loans on nonaccrual status at december  totaling million 
nonaccrual loans are considered impaired under the criteria of sfas no 
 but no valuation allowance was maintained at any time since the company believes that the estimated fair value of the underlying properties exceeded its recorded investment 
at december  and  there were no other impaired loans 
at december   there were million of loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest  compared to none at december  at december   the bank was closely monitoring four real estate loans totaling million  each of which are collateralized by real estate located in new jersey 
each loan is guaranteed by a principal who is experiencing legal and financial difficulties and for whom a court appointed fiscal and liquidation agent has been appointed to administer his assets 
as of december   all of these loans were on accruing status as the bank is receiving payments of principal and interest 
all four loans were originated within the bank s underwriting guidelines 
although the company presently believes that its two nonaccrual loans and the four loans it is closely monitoring are well collateralized  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur loan chargeoffs or significant expenses with respect to the ultimate collection of these loans 
allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  compared to million at december   and represented of total loans net of deferred fees outstanding at december  and at december  the increase in the allowance was due to provisions aggregating million  of which million resulted from net loan growth which amounted to million from december  and million resulted from decreases in the internal credit ratings of several loans

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general 
the company manages its liquidity position on a daily basis to assure that funds are available to meet its operating requirements  loan and investment commitments  deposit withdrawals and debt service obligations 
primary sources of funds consist of the following retail deposits obtained through the bank s branch offices and through the mail  principal repayments of loans  maturities and calls of securities  issuance of debentures  borrowings from the federal funds market and through fhlb advances  and cash flow provided by operating activities 
for additional detail concerning the company s cash flows  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report 
intervest national bank 
the bank s lending business is dependent on its continuing ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the rates offered on its deposits and the yields earned on its loans 
the bank needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain deposits to fund its loan originations 
the bank has and expects to continue to rely heavily on certificates of deposit time deposits as its main source of funds 
total consolidated deposits amounted to billion at december  and time deposits represented  or billion  of those deposits  up from at december  additionally  time deposits of  or more at december  totaled million and included million of brokered deposits 
brokered deposits are sold by investment firms  which are paid a fee by the bank for placing the deposit 
the bank must maintain its status as a well capitalized insured depository institution in order to solicit and accept  renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction 
time deposits are the only deposit accounts offered by the bank that have stated maturity dates 
these deposits are generally considered to be rate sensitive and have a higher cost than deposits with no stated maturities  such as checking  savings and money market accounts 
at december   the bank had million of time deposits maturing by december  the bank expects that a substantial portion of these deposits will be renewed and stay with the bank 
the bank has in the past and may continue in the future to rely on capital contributions from the holding company to increase its capital to support its asset growth 
the holding company made a total of million of cash capital contributions to the bank during and none in at december   the bank had excess capital to support an additional million of asset growth and still maintain a well capitalized designation 
the bank also borrows funds on an overnight or short term basis to manage its liquidity needs 
at december   the bank had agreements with correspondent banks whereby it could borrow up to million on an unsecured basis 
as a member of the fhlb and frb  the bank can also borrow from these institutions on a secured basis 
during  the bank utilized a total of million of short term borrowings of which million was outstanding at december  at december   the bank had available collateral consisting of investment securities to support additional total borrowings of million from the fhlb and frb 
at december   the bank had commitments to lend of million  most of which are anticipated to be funded over the next months from the sources of funds described above 
intervest mortgage corporation 
intervest mortgage corporation has and expects to continue to rely on the issuance of its subordinated debentures in registered  best efforts offerings to the public as a source of funds to support its loan originations 
in addition  as the bank s mortgage loan portfolio has grown  service fee income received by intervest mortgage corporation from the bank has comprised a large percentage of intervest mortgage corporation s earnings and cash inflows 
the bank has a servicing agreement with intervest mortgage corporation which is described under the caption loan solicitation and processing in item 
business 
the bank paid million in to intervest mortgage corporation in connection with this agreement 
from time to time  intervest mortgage corporation has also received cash capital contributions from the holding company 
no contributions have been made since intervest mortgage corporation s lending business is dependent on its ability to sell its subordinated debentures with interest rates that result in a positive interest rate spread  which is the difference between yields earned on its loans and the rates paid on its debentures 
at december   intervest mortgage corporation had million of debentures outstanding with fixed interest rates that range from to and maturities that range from april  to july  in  intervest mortgage corporation repaid million of its debentures prior to their stated maturity  including million of related accrued interest payable  and issued new debentures totaling million for net proceeds  after offering costs  of million 
at december   intervest mortgage corporation 
table of contents had million of debentures and million of accrued interest payable maturing by december  subsequent to december  and prior to the filing of this report  intervest mortgage corporation repaid the million prior to the stated maturity of the debentures  including million of related accrued interest payable  from cash on hand 
at december   intervest mortgage corporation had million in cash and short term investments and commitments to lend of less than million 
in addition  million of its mortgage loans are scheduled to mature during as a result  both current cash and the proceeds from repayment of maturing mortgages will be available for investment in new mortgage loans 
the current level of cash and short term investments is higher than has been customary for intervest mortgage corporation and the level of its outstanding commitments is at a historically low level 
the increase in cash is primarily attributable to a significant decline in originations of new mortgage loans during the second half of that is attributable to increased competitive market conditions and lower pricing  which have made it more difficult for intervest mortgage corporation  as well as the bank  to identify suitable mortgage investment opportunities 
the level of outstanding loan commitments has always fluctuated with market conditions and is unpredictable 
holding company 
the holding company s sources of funds and capital to date have been derived from the following interest income from a limited portfolio of mortgage loans and short term investments  monthly dividends from the bank to service interest expense on trust preferred securities  monthly management fees from intervest mortgage corporation and the bank for providing these subsidiaries with certain administrative services  the issuance of its common stock through public offerings  exercise of outstanding common stock warrants and conversion of outstanding convertible debentures  the issuance of trust preferred securities through its wholly owned business trusts  and the direct issuance of other subordinated debentures to the public 
in  the holding company repaid prior to their stated maturity a total of million of debentures with higher interest rates including million of trust preferred securities 
at december   the holding company did not have any debentures maturing in subsequent to december  and prior to the filing of this report  the holding company repaid million of additional debentures prior to their stated maturity from cash on hand 
in the third quarter of  the holding company completed a public offering of  shares of its class a common stock for per share 
the issuance of these shares  after underwriting commissions and expenses  resulted in million of additional capital  which was invested in the bank as a capital contribution 
the holding company  through its wholly owned business trusts  has issued at various times since a total of million of trust preferred securities  with both fixed and variable rates of interest  that mature in or later 
the resulting proceeds have been invested in the bank at various times through capital contributions 
in september  the holding company issued additional trust preferred securities in the amount of million through its newly established intervest statutory trust v 
the new securities mature in years and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum for the first five years and thereafter at a floating rate of over month libor 
on december   the holding company used the proceeds from the recent sale  together with available cash on hand  to repay prior to their stated maturity million of trust preferred securities with a fixed rate of that were issued in the early repayment of these securities  as well as those of intervest mortgage corporation noted above  resulted in a total of million of related unamortized issuance costs being expensed in the fourth quarter of at december   million of trust preferred securities were outstanding for which the holding company is required to make interest payments that total million annually 
the bank provides the funds in the form of dividends to the holding company for this debt service 
at december   million of the trust preferred securities representing outstanding debentures net of the holding company s common stock investments in the trusts qualified as regulatory tier capital

regulatory capital the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as disclosed in detail elsewhere in this report  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other bank regulatory agencies use five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premiums 
these categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s and the company s financial statements 
the bank is required to maintain regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively 
at december  and  management believes the bank met its capital adequacy requirements and is a well capitalized institution as defined in the regulations  which require minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based ratios of  and  respectively 
management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the bank s designation as a well capitalized institution 
information regarding the bank s regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets the holding company on a consolidated basis is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the frb 
these guidelines require a ratio of tier or core capital  as defined in the guidelines  to total risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
the guidelines also require a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total average assets of not less than 
at december  and  management believes that the holding company met its capital adequacy requirements 

table of contents information regarding consolidated regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized below at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets at december  and  there were million and million of qualifying capital securities outstanding  respectively  representing the total outstanding debentures issued to statutory trust i  ii  iii  iv and v by the holding company  net of the holding company s investments in those trusts 
at december   million was included in tier i capital and at december   million was included in tier capital  and the remaining portion was included in tier capital 
the inclusion of these securities in tier capital is limited to of core capital elements  as defined in the fdic regulations in  the federal reserve issued a final rule that retains trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies bhc  but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards 
the rule provides a transition period for bhcs to meet the new  stricter limitations within regulatory capital by allowing the limits on restricted core capital elements to become fully effective as of march  until march   bhcs generally must comply with the current tier capital limits 
that is  bhcs generally must calculate their tier capital on a basis that limits the aggregate amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities to percent of the sum of qualifying common stockholder s equity  qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  qualifying minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities 
amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier capital 
beginning march   qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities  as well as certain types of minority interest  are limited to percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill 
the company does not have any goodwill or outstanding preferred stock 
beginning march   the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier capital are limited to percent of tier capital net of goodwill 
however  amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organization s funding and financial condition 
the final rule also provides that in the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures  the associated trust preferred securities must be treated as limited life preferred stock 
thus  in the last five years of the life of the note  the outstanding amount of trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital  subject  together with subordinated debt and other limited life preferred stock  to a limit of percent of tier capital 
during this period  the trust preferred securities will be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth of the original amount less redemptions each year and excluded totally from tier capital during the last year of life of the underlying note 
as of december  and  assuming the holding company no longer included its trust preferred securities in tier capital  it would still have exceed the well capitalized threshold under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of trust preferred securities 
asset and liability management interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on its net interest income and capital 
the company does not engage in trading or hedging activities  nor does it invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 

table of contents the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to in the industry as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different than those assumed in the gap analysis 
the company s one year positive interest rate sensitivity gap decreased to million  or of total assets  at december   from million  or at december  the decrease in the positive gap primarily reflects an increase in loans and security investments with maturities in excess of one year  funded by increases in time deposits with maturities of one year or less 
for purposes of computing the gap  all deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by the bank did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year gap would have been a positive at december   compared to a positive at december  many of the company s floating rate loans have a floor  or minimum rate  that is determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the unfavorable effect on interest income of a falling rate environment because the interest rates on such loans do not reset downward 
however  the company may nonetheless experience loan prepayments  the amount of which cannot be predicted  and reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
notwithstanding all of the above  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis

fixed rate loans and debentures payable are scheduled  including repayments  according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees  nonaccrual loans and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their contractual maturity or the date in which the interest rate is scheduled to increase 
the effects of possible prepayments that may result from the issuer s right to call a security before its contractual maturity date are not considered 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts  and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities  and the issuance of its debentures 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 

table of contents the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
management actively monitors and manages the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital 
to this regard  the bank does internal analyses by preparing interest rate shock scenarios to its basic one year gap model as a quantitative tool to measure the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market interest rates 
the bank also engages an outside consultant to prepare quarterly reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over projected periods 
these computations rely on various assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of the balance sheet
