overview we are a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is comprised of two segments architectural products and services architectural and large scale optical lso 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass and windows primarily comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  a leading fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation  maintenance and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall  and linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  a value added glass and acrylic manufacturer for the custom picture framing market  and a producer of optical thin film coatings for consumer electronics displays 
the following are the key items that impacted fiscal the positive impact from the improvement in the architectural segment s operating performance was primarily the result of the improved commercial construction market  as seen in increased pricing and volume 
the segment was also positively affected by improved productivity 
the negative impact from a less favorable mix of value added picture framing glass within the lso segment 
we expect the mix to improve in the future as our marketing and partnering efforts increase the overall volume of value added picture framing glass as well as advance the mix of products up the value added continuum 
we significantly increased our backlog during the year supporting continued revenue growth 
we invested million in our new architectural glass fabrication plant in st 
george  utah to increase capacity in our glass fabrication business 
we announced our intent to sell the remaining portion of the auto glass segment that manufactures and sells original equipment manufacturers oem and aftermarket replacement windshields for the recreational vehicle and bus markets 
we restated the consolidated financial statements to show the results of the auto glass segment in discontinued operations 
architectural segment 
our architectural segment is the largest and most cyclical segment in our portfolio 
the segment services the commercial construction markets  which have improved over our three most recent fiscal years 
we look at many market indicators  such as office space vacancy rates  architectural bidding statistics and other economic indicators to gain insight into the commercial construction market 
specifically  we focus on the united states non residential construction market based on reports by mcgraw hill construction fw dodge  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends 
from their fourth quarter calendar report  the markets that we serve had an annual compounded growth rate of percent over our past three fiscal years 
as background  our fiscal was the low point in the united states construction cycle adjusted for our fiscal year end and the lag that is required to account for the timing of when our services typically are initiated in a construction project approximately nine months 
our segment s compounded annual growth rate over that same time period was nearly percent 
in fiscal  we increased revenues percent and grew operating income percent 
our operating margin rose to percent in fiscal from percent in the prior year 
we believe that we are well positioned to exceed our prior construction cycle peak annual operating margin of percent by fiscal we are anticipating continued improvement in the commercial construction market as mcgraw hill construction fw dodge has projected continued growth in united states construction value through our fiscal  with only one flat year within that time frame 
however  in order to capitalize on the favorable market conditions  we need to continue to focus on our value propositions 
building contractors value our ability to deliver quality  distinctive window and curtainwall solutions to projects on time and on budget  helping to minimize costly job site labor overruns 
their customers building owners and developers value the distinctive looks  energy savings and security features of our glass systems 
these benefits can contribute to higher office lease rates  lower operating costs due to the energy efficiency of our value added glass  a better environment for building occupants  and protection for buildings and occupants from hurricanes and blasts 
we continue to execute against our strategic initiative to grow our architectural glass market share with energy efficient  hurricane and blast products for the office high rise condominium  health care  education and institutional markets 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the construction of and began operating our new glass fabrication facility in st 
george  utah 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made the strategic decision to exit our auto glass segment business and convert the facility to support the growing architectural glass market 
we expect this conversion to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal our second strategy within the architectural segment is to continue to strengthen our businesses that manufacture windows and curtainwall systems  install glass on new buildings  and renovate and service window and curtainwall systems on older buildings 
much of the focus during fiscal was to improve installation project margins and increase our presence in the standard window business 
we accomplished this by leveraging our experienced project managers in our installation business by focusing our sales efforts on larger  less complex installation projects that better utilize our project manager expertise and by expanding our lower cost  standard commercial window line 
the project management skills of our installation business  the largest in the united states  are especially suited for the medium to high end non monumental commercial construction projects 
additionally  apogee has begun focusing on the green building trend in the north american commercial construction market 
apogee s industry leading products allow us to partner with architects and building contractors to help them understand the benefits of incorporating our energy efficient products and system solutions in buildings and how our energy efficient products and systems can contribute to achieving leadership in energy and environmental design leed certification 
our energy efficient products can reduce energy consumption and other operating costs for commercial buildings 
lso segment 
our picture framing strategy is to convert the custom framing market to our highest value added products 
for fiscal  although we maintained our total level of value added products compared to the prior year  we experienced a product mix shift to lower value added products  primarily due to certain national retailers who made a variety of changes to their product mix offerings during the year 
going forward  we believe our products  marketing and customer relationships are positioned to grow sales of higher value added picture framing glass 
we continue to help framers sell consumers value added products rather than clear glass by showing them how they can increase their profitability by selling up the value added product continuum 
we offer framers point of purchase displays to assist them in showing their consumers the visual differences between clear glass and our value added picture framing glass products 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the percent increase in sales was primarily due to increased architectural glass pricing  improved job cost flow in our architectural installation business and increased volume across all of our architectural businesses primarily as a result of the improved north american commercial construction market 
fiscal also included weeks compared to the prior year week period  which had a percent impact on current year sales 
these increases were slightly offset by a decline in lso revenues as certain customers offered a less favorable product mix of value added picture framing glass during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal the percent increase in sales was primarily due to increased volume within our architectural segment businesses  resulting from improved project flow  market improvement  market share growth and the effects of the awalls acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  product mix shift to higher value added picture framing glass and increased pre framed art sales within the lso segment contributed to the year over year increase in net sales 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income  net equity in earnings loss of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net earnings effective income tax rate for continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points in fiscal over fiscal the resulting decrease in gross margins was primarily due to the unfavorable shift in mix of value added picture framing glass and a million non cash charge related to the planned exit of the pre framed art wall d cor product line within the lso segment 
additionally  an increase in health insurance costs due to higher than expected utilization and a higher level of high dollar claims negatively impacted the gross margin 
these items were partially offset by improved pricing in the architectural segment  operational improvements across both the architectural and lso segments  net proceeds from the settlement of a class action lawsuit with a flat glass manufacturer  which impacted margins by percentage points  and improved project mix in the architectural segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by percentage points as a percentage of net sales  but reflected an increase in spending of million over fiscal the increased spending was primarily due to increased salaries and wages  the impact of expensing stock options and increased incentive compensation expenses due to improved financial performance 
these increases were partially offset by a gain on sale of fixed assets in fiscal the reduction as a percentage of sales is primarily due to leveraging the fixed cost components of sg a on higher sales 
interest expense increased million over fiscal as a result of a higher weighted average interest rate  including the effects of our swap agreements  and an increase in average borrowings during the year 
an increase in the amount of interest that was capitalized into the cost of significant projects partially offset the increase in debt interest 
equity in affiliated companies reflects our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc 
income increased million over fiscal  reflecting higher sales volume  offset by lower selling prices as a result of market conditions 
income tax expense for fiscal increased by million over fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate to from was primarily due to the prior year  non cash resolution of certain tax matters  including completion of various audits and reviews by taxing authorities 
our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to fiscal earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share 
the increase in earnings was primarily due to the improved results in our architectural segment businesses 
fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points in fiscal from fiscal the resulting increase in margins was primarily due to improved pricing and the higher level of activity in the architectural segment  which allowed for increased capacity utilization  partially offset by higher costs for materials  utilities  fuel and increased health costs as well as the impact of unplanned equipment downtime 
in addition  the lso segment had a product mix shift to higher value added products 
fiscal included net proceeds of million from a class action lawsuit settlement with certain flat glass manufacturers with respect to glass purchases from to  which increased the fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales by percentage points 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  remained flat at percent  with an increase in spending of million over fiscal the primary drivers for the increased spending were the added costs from the awalls acquisition  an increase in promotional and advertising expenses  strategic consulting costs and an increase in incentive compensation expenses due to improved financial performance 
the decrease in fiscal interest income was the result of interest received on a federal income tax refund during fiscal interest expense decreased by million from fiscal as a result of a lower weighted average interest rate  including the effects of our swap agreement  even though our average borrowings were higher during the year 
also contributing was an increased amount of interest that was capitalized into the cost of significant projects 
equity in affiliated companies reflects our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc  and included income of million in fiscal  versus a loss of million in fiscal the increase was related to operational improvements  increased volume and improved market share within the autoglass distribution market 
fiscal income tax expense increased by million over fiscal while the effective income tax rate decreased to from 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a non cash resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal the decrease from our average federal and state statutory tax rate of included the item above and tax credits and other deductions realized 
our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to fiscal earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share 
this increase in earnings was primarily the result of improved results in our architectural and picture framing businesses  along with a one time net tax benefit of per share realized in the third quarter of fiscal segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal architectural net sales for fiscal increased percent to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to increased architectural glass pricing  improved job cost flow in the installation business and increased volume in the glass fabrication business 
the primary driver behind these increases was the improvement in the overall commercial construction market 
mcgraw hill construction fw dodge reported non residential growth at percent for calendar year which relates to our fiscal in addition  the extra week in fiscal had an impact of percent on current year sales 
the segment s operating income in fiscal more than doubled compared to fiscal operating margin increased to percent for fiscal  from percent in fiscal the increased operating income and margin reflect the higher pricing and operational improvements 
a better mix of projects with higher margins  particularly in our installation business  contributed to the improved margins as well 
also  the net flat glass settlement proceeds in the current year contributed million or percentage points 
fiscal compared to fiscal architectural net sales for fiscal increased percent to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to increased volume primarily from the improvement in market conditions  and improved project cost flow in high end condominiums  government and institutional work as well as approximately million of new volume attributable to awalls 
projects using more value added hurricane and blast products also helped improve our product mix 
the segment s operating income in fiscal was million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal operating margin increased to percent for fiscal from percent in fiscal increased operating income and margins reflect higher sales volume  improved pricing and operational gains  partially offset by higher costs for materials  utilities  fuel  health costs and million for realignment costs in our window and curtainwall manufacturing business 
additionally  unplanned equipment downtime and higher costs than anticipated to complete several projects in our installation business impacted operating margins 
fiscal included million in earnings for the flat glass settlement 
large scale optical technologies lso in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenue was down percent from fiscal due to an unusually strong fiscal additionally  during the first half of fiscal  certain customers offered a less favorable mix of value added picture framing products 
these factors were somewhat offset by the percent impact of the extra week in fiscal total value added picture framing glass remained high as a percent of total picture frame sales  at approximately percent  but the mix of best products was down from last year 
operating income decreased by percent in fiscal from fiscal  as a result of the less favorable value added picture framing glass mix 
in addition  we incurred a million non cash charge related to the planned exit of the pre framed art wall d cor product line 
these items were partially offset by the million net flat glass settlement proceeds  which increased margins by percentage points 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue growth of percent over fiscal reflects the impact of a higher mix of value added picture framing products and increased volume of pre framed art 
operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of the product mix shift to higher margin value added picture framing glass 
the consolidation of the segment s two operating facilities and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity to picture framing glass from consumer electronics also contributed to the increase in operating income 
consolidated backlog at march   our consolidated backlog was million  up percent from the million reported at february  as a result of strong market conditions 
the backlog of the architectural segment represented percent of consolidated backlog 
we expect percent of our total backlog to be recognized in fiscal revenue 
we view backlog as an important statistic in evaluating the level of sales activity and short term sales trends in our business 
however  as backlog is only one indicator and is not an effective indicator of the ultimate profitability of our sales  we do not believe that backlog should be used as the sole indicator of future earnings of the company 
acquisitions on december   the architectural segment completed the asset purchase of awalls as part of our strategy to strengthen and grow the architectural installation business 
the acquisition cost for this business was million  net of cash acquired of million 
the purchase price included million in intangible assets  million and million were assigned to customer relationships and non compete agreements  respectively  based on preliminary valuations 
as a result of finalizing the valuations of net assets acquired  an adjustment of million was made to increase the value of the customer relationships during fiscal the amortization periods of years and five years  respectively  match their useful lives 
of this transaction  million of payments relating to the non compete agreements still remain and are payable through fiscal these non compete agreements are with the previous owners of awalls  two of whom are current employees of the company 
additionally  the purchase price includes an earn out provision contingent on execution of the acquired backlog over a two year period 
during both fiscal and  the company paid million pursuant to earn out provisions and recorded the amounts as additional goodwill 
discontinued operations we announced our intention to discontinue the manufacturing of automotive replacement glass arg products and our decision to sell the remaining portion of the auto glass segment that manufactures and sells oem and aftermarket replacement windshields for the recreational vehicle and bus markets during fiscal as a result  we restated the consolidated financial statements to show the results of the auto glass segment in discontinued operations 
we expect to complete the sale of certain assets related to the business during fiscal  and will convert the facility to support the architectural segment s glass fabrication business 
we expect the conversion to be completed and operational during fiscal on january   we completed the cash sale of harmon autoglass  with the selling price subject to a final working capital adjustment 
the adjustment was finalized during the second quarter of fiscal  with no effect to our operating results 
properties that had not been sold with harmon autoglass and which remained as assets held for sale were sold for net proceeds of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in several transactions in fiscal years through  we completed the sale of our large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of our detention security business and the exit from international curtainwall operations 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to these discontinued operations are recorded as liabilities of discontinued operations and a majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to discontinued operations are expected to be paid within the next three years 
the majority of these liabilities relate to the international curtainwall operations  including bonds outstanding  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters  will not be known until they are settled within the uk and french courts 
the reserve for discontinued operations also covers other liability issues  consisting of warranty and other costs relating to these and other international construction projects 
related party transactions as a result of our percent interest in ppg auto glass  in which ppg holds the remaining interest  various transactions we enter into with ppg and ppg auto glass are deemed to be related party transactions 
under the terms of a multi year agreement which expired in fiscal  our auto glass manufacturing business had been committed to selling a significant portion of its windshield capacity to ppg 
we had been transitioning our capacity to sell directly to aftermarket manufacturers  including ppg 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue manufacturing arg products and ceased manufacturing these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal our investment in ppg auto glass totals million  which includes million in goodwill 
we assess the fair market value of this investment on a regular basis  as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we consider many factors  including short and long term projections of future performance associated with these assets 
if this review indicates that the investment will not be recoverable based on the estimated discounted cash flows  the carrying value of such assets would be reduced to their estimated fair value 
in addition to our investment in ppg auto glass  we entered into a short term loan agreement to provide ppg auto glass with a million working capital loan during the fourth quarter of fiscal the terms of the note receivable were considered arms length  and the note matured on july  and was paid in full during the second quarter of fiscal the note receivable was included in receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and was million at february  as a result of its acquisition of awalls  the company has a lease for a facility located in bolingbrook  il with the former owners  two of whom remain employees of the company  and neither of whom are officers of the company 
this facility was sold to an unrelated third party in the first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands net cash provided by continuing operating activities capital expenditures and acquisition of intangible assets acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired proceeds from dispositions of property borrowing repayment activities  net purchases and retirement of company common stock dividends paid operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million for fiscal  which was driven by higher net earnings 
additionally  although working capital increased during fiscal  the increase was less than the fiscal increase  resulting in a positive variance when comparing sources of cash  year on year 
we view reducing or at least maintaining current levels of working capital as a percentage of sales as a priority for the company 
although our non cash working capital current assets  excluding cash  less current liabilities decreased slightly to million at march  from million at february   non cash working capital as a percentage of sales was percent at march   down from percent at fiscal year end 
investing activities 
investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  including acquisition of intangible assets  in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal capital expenditures included spending of million for our new architectural glass fabrication plant in st 
george  utah 
fiscal expenditures included spending for our architectural glass capacity expansion in statesboro  georgia  modernization for our owatonna  minnesota plant and the purchase of used equipment  which we upgraded to current technology for our new facility in st 
george  utah 
the fiscal investing activities also included the acquisition of awalls to further improve our installation business operations and provide geographic growth 
we gained management depth for our installation business and entered the northwest region of the united states through the acquisition of awalls 
the acquisition cost was million  including future payments for non compete agreements 
in fiscal  we expect to incur capital expenditures to complete current architectural glass expansions and spending to expand picture framing glass capacity within the lso segment for fiscal fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to million 
we have entered sale and leaseback agreements for equipment that provide an option to purchase the equipment at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the leases  which occurs in fiscal and the leases are classified as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we notified our lender of our intent to exercise the early buy out option on one of our equipment leases 
the early buy out was effective march   at the beginning of our fiscal  in the amount of million 
under our sale and leaseback transactions  total gains of million have been deferred and are being recognized over the terms of the respective leases 
the march  and february  unamortized portion of the deferred gain of million and million  respectively  is included in the balance sheet captions accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the deferred gain associated with the early buy out of equipment on march  reduced the capitalized value of the purchased equipment 
the average annual lease payment over the life of the remaining leases is million 
we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell parts of our current businesses 
financing activities 
net payments on all of our borrowings for fiscal were million  net proceeds were million in fiscal and net payments in fiscal were million 
total outstanding borrowings decreased to million at march  from million at the end of fiscal our debt to total capital ratio was percent at the end of fiscal  down from percent at the end of fiscal the majority of our long term debt at the end of the year  million  consisted of bank borrowings under our million syndicated revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of  shares of common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices 
we repurchased  shares under this program  for a total of million through february  in fiscal  we repurchased an additional  shares for million 
no share repurchases were made under this plan during fiscal we have purchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million since the inception of this program 
we have remaining authority to repurchase  shares under this program 
in addition to the shares repurchased according to this repurchase plan  we also purchased million and million of company stock from employees pursuant to terms of board and shareholder approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 
we have paid million in dividends during the current year  compared to million in the prior year as a result of making five quarterly payments in the current year  compared to four in the prior year period solely due to timing of payments 
other financing activities 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total borrowings under credit facility industrial revenue bonds operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations interest on fixed rate debt other obligations total cash obligations we maintain a million revolving credit facility 
on november  we entered into amendment no 
to the credit agreement 
the amendment extended the expiration date of the agreement from may to november  effectively decreased the interest rate payable on borrowings and decreased the commitment fee 
no other provisions of the agreement were affected by the amendment 
the financing costs associated with the credit facility are being amortized over the term of the credit agreement 
borrowings of million were outstanding as of march  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined in the credit facility based on certain quarterly financial calculations 
the minimum required net worth computed in accordance with the credit agreement at march  was million  whereas our net worth as defined in the credit facility was million 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a debt to cash flow ratio of no more than 
this ratio is computed daily  with cash flow computed on a rolling month basis 
our ratio was at march  if we are not in compliance with either of these covenants  the lender may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
at march   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the credit facility 
long term debt also includes million of industrial development bonds that mature in fiscal years through we have purchase obligations for capital expenditures related to the construction of our new architectural glass fabrication facility in st 
george  utah 
we also have purchase obligations for raw material commitments and for a long term freight commitment 
as of march   these purchase obligations totaled million 
we have entered into two interest rate swap agreements that  at march   effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
the notional value of the swaps varies between million and million  at expiration on march  we receive payments at variable rates while making payments at fixed rates of and percent 
the swap agreements had a notional value of million at february  the net present liability associated with these swaps was minimal at the end of both fiscal and from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment  hardware  software and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
the other obligations in the table above relate to non compete and consulting agreements with current and former employees 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which were predominantly issued for performance related bonds in our discontinued european curtainwall business  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of projects that are in process and in our backlog 
at march   these bonds totaled million 
with respect to our current portfolio of businesses  we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds 
we experienced a material increase in our insurance premiums and risk retention for our third party product liability coverages in fiscal  and although we were able to continue these coverages through fiscal  the premiums and retention have remained high 
as a result  a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for fiscal  we believe that current cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividend payments 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of routine operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at march  or february  stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first fiscal year beginning after june  effective february   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  we recognized million of incremental compensation expense for the year ended march   which is reflected in sg a expenses in the consolidated results of operations 
for additional information on the adoption of sfas no

outlook the following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
overall revenues for the year are expected to increase to percent 
fiscal is a week year  while fiscal had weeks  on a comparable basis  fiscal growth would be approximately to percent 
architectural segment revenues are expected to increase to percent for the year 
large scale optical segment revenues are expected to be flat compared to the prior year 
annual gross margins are expected to be approximately to percent  or to percentage points higher than in fiscal  increased pricing  operational improvements and cost reductions are expected to more than offset increases in wages  health care  energy  materials and freight 
expected annual operating margins by segment are architectural  to percent  and large scale optical  to percent 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales are projected to be approximately to percent 
equity in affiliates  which reflects apogee s portion of the results of the ppg auto glass joint venture  is expected to report pre tax earnings of approximately million 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately to million  including capital for capacity expansions in the architectural and lso segments 
depreciation and amortization are estimated at to million for the year 
debt is expected to be approximately to million at year end 
the effective tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately percent

recently issued accounting pronouncements see new accounting standards set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k  for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future  which is incorporated by reference herein 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes  and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition our standard product sales terms are free on board fob shipping point or fob destination and revenue is recognized when title has transferred 
however  our installation business records revenue on a percentage of completion basis as it relates to revenues earned from construction contracts 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our consolidated sales and percent of our architectural segment sales were recorded on a percentage of completion basis 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract  and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in sales only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
we base our determination of value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
we also consider other factors such as public information for transactions made on similar businesses to ours 
there can be no assurances that these forecasts will be attained 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved  either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation  can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the insurance policies include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales 
reserves for discontinued operations we reserve for the remaining estimated future cash outflows associated with our exit from discontinued operations 
the majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made within the next three years 
the primary components of the accruals relate to the remaining exit costs from the international curtainwall operations of our large scale construction business 
these long term accruals include settlement of outstanding performance bonds  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk and french courts 
we also reserve for product liability issues and the related legal costs for specific projects completed both domestically and internationally 
we reserve based on known claims  estimating their expected losses  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs for these discontinued operations projects 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  employment practices and architect s and engineer s errors and omissions risk and other miscellaneous coverages 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
additionally  we maintain a self insurance reserve for our health insurance programs maintained for the benefit of our eligible employees and non employee directors 
we estimate a reserve based on historical levels of amounts incurred but not reported 
stock based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which was adopted on february  under this standard  the fair value of each share based payment award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our management with responsibility for financial reporting  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
we use interest rate swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   we had interest rate swaps covering million of variable rate debt 
the net present liability associated with these swaps was minimal at the end of fiscal the interest rate swaps are designated as and are effective as cash flow hedges  and are included in the balance sheet with other long term liabilities  with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income 
derivative gains and losses included in other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
besides the market risk related to interest rate changes  the commercial construction markets in which our businesses operate are highly affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  significant interest rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results 
we generally do not have significant exposure to foreign exchange risk as the majority of our sales are within the united states and those outside the united states are generally denominated in us dollars
