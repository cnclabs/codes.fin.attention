overall sales volumes are higher and selling prices are higher  both primarily related to acrylonitrile 
the divestiture of the acrylamide product line on october  reduced sales but was more than fully offset by increased sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylamide product line 
acrylonitrile is the key raw material to make acrylamide and prior to the divestiture our internal uses of acrylonitrile to make acrylamide were treated as internal transfers  and our internal uses of acrylamide to make certain of our divested water treating chemicals were treated as intersegment sales 
after the divestiture  acrylonitrile used to make acrylamide is now a third party sale and for the year this added to sales 
after excluding the above  selling volumes increased from the prior year when volumes were adversely impacted due to plant shutdowns as a result of the hurricanes in the us gulf coast in the third quarter of on a regional basis selling volumes in asia pacific were down due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile for use in upgrading to acrylic fiber 
selling volumes in europe middle east africa improved due to increased demand for imported acrylonitrile as a result of reduced regional supply

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
currencies are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk we periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into us dollar equivalent amounts were as follows buy pound canadian australian us sell euro sterling dollar dollar dollar us dollar euro norwegian krone japanese yen brazilian real taiwan dollar other the unfavorable fair value of currency contracts  based on exchange rates at december   was approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would decrease by approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
in september   we entered into euro of five year cross currency swaps and euro of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the year notes and year notes into euro denominated liabilities 
the swaps included an initial exchange of on october  and will require final principal exchanges of on each settlement date of the year and year notes october  and october   respectively 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us dollars to counterparties and received euros 
upon final exchange  we will provide euros to counterparties and receive us dollars 
the swaps also call for a semi annual exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed us dollar interest receipts 
with respect to the five year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the five year swaps 
with respect to the ten year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the ten year swaps 
the cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with one of our subsidiaries 
the cross currency swaps plus the euro denominated bank borrowings and a portion of an intercompany euro denominated loans payable naturally hedge our euro denominated intercompany loans receivable and  further  provide a partial hedge of our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
from time to time we also enter into designated forward euro contracts to adjust the amount of the net investment hedge 
at december   we had designated forward contracts to purchase euro at december   the fair value of the five and ten year swaps were and  respectively 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase decrease of approximately in the value of the hedging instruments referred to above 
commodity price risk we use natural gas swaps  which are financially settled  to hedge certain utility requirements 
the maturities of these swaps correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
these swaps are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value  which will be reclassified into manufacturing cost of sales through june as these swaps are settled 
at december   we had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value loss of 
assuming that year end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately interest rate risk at december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of of short term borrowings and long term debt  including the current portion  which had a carrying value of  a face value of and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the weighted average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense would increase decrease by approximately for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease increase by approximately outlook in our february  press release  which was also furnished as an exhibit to a current report on form k  we set forth our assumptions and management s best estimate of the full year earnings at the time based on various assumptions set forth in our press release 
we forecasted diluted earnings per share in the range of  before any potential special items for the year 
there can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected 
actual results may differ materially 
see comments on forward looking statements 
significant accounting estimates critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
share based compensation in december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and requires companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
with the adoption of sfas r  the compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant  and not based on the price of our common stock at the end of each reporting period as formerly was required under apb no 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash cash settled sars is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of vesting  also a change from apb no 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares stock settled sars and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
sfas r also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options and stock settled sars will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation  and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environment remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study by the actuarial and analytics practice of aon risk consultants aon 
the study estimated our gross asbestos liabilities using a frequency severity approach 
with this approach  the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed to discounted basis 
future claim frequency has been estimated using our claims history and the stallard manton epidemiological decay model  a widely used industry study 
the decay model assumes that future levels of claims activity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next to years 
our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and our historical claim experience 
the estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation 
although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts  they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets 
retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
our most significant pension plans are in the us  and constituted over of our consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
we discounted our us future pension liabilities using a rate of at december  the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
the expected rate of return on our us plan assets  which was for  reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
we establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
the us pension plan s investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
impairment of goodwill we have defined our segments as our sfas no 
reporting units 
our four business segments are cytec performance chemicals  cytec surface specialties  cytec engineered materials and building block chemicals 
cytec performance chemicals serves large  global industrial markets 
cytec surface specialties serves the large  global coatings market 
cytec engineered materials serves principally aerospace markets 
building block chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users 
the segments above reflect how we run our company  manage the assets and the customer perspective 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
we utilize a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates 
due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units  values are determined utilizing a three year average 
the three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
if the market multiple approach yields a result which may indicate a possible impairment  a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit s fair value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if such tax position is probable of being sustained 
we continually evaluate our tax contingency accruals and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution 
our tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable 
acquisitions we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations 
derivative financial instruments and certain hedging activities our established policies allow the use of derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates  certain commodity eg  natural gas prices  interest rates and equity prices 
derivative instruments currently utilized include currency forward contracts and swaps  natural gas swaps  cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
we use currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business 
the principal transactions hedged involve accounts receivable  accounts payable and loans 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
currency forward contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities with changes in their fair value recorded in other income expense  net together with offsetting gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
we use cross currency swaps to synthetically convert some of our us dollar denominated debt to hedge future cash flows from euro receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with our subsidiaries against changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates 
the cross currency swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities 
changes in fair value include both an interest and an exchange component 
the interest component is recorded in other comprehensive income while the exchange component is recorded in other income expense  net together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged intercompany receivables 
we use natural gas swaps  which are financially settled  to hedge a portion of utility requirements at certain of our facilities 
these swaps  which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases  have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  with offsetting amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on an after tax basis 
gains and losses are reclassified into earnings  as a component of manufacturing cost of sales in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings 
the fair values of all these instruments are based on quotes from third party financial institutions
