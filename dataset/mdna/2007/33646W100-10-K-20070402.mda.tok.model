historical per share data has been adjusted to reflect our may six for five stock split 
critical accounting policies the company has adopted various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from those judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements

during the year management expects that interest rates will remain fairly stable for the first half of the year with moderate declines in the second half 
if interest rate projections are accurate  little  if any improvement in net interest income is expected in market risk interest rate sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although we manage other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk and this risk could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk do not affect us directly 
achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of our asset liability function 
we attempt to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
we seek to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
our asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be material over time 
interest rate sensitivity management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities and is an important part of asset liability management 
it is the objective of interest rate sensitivity management to generate stable growth in net interest income  and to control the risks associated with interest rate movement 
management constantly reviews interest rate risk exposure and the expected interest rate environment so that timely adjustments in interest rate sensitivity can be made 
the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates that  on a cumulative basis through twelve months  rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  resulting in a liability sensitive position at december  of million for a cumulative gap ratio of 
when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities for a specific repricing horizon  a positive interest sensitivity gap results 
the gap is negative when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets  as was the case at december   with respect to the one year time horizon 
for a bank with a negative gap  such as the bank  falling interest rates would be expected to have a positive effect on net interest income and rising rates would be expected to have the opposite effect

a certain degree of risk taking is inherent in the extension of credit 
management has established loan and credit policies designed to control both the types and amounts of risks assumed and to ultimately minimize losses 
such policies include limitations on loan to collateral values for various types of collateral  requirements for appraisals of real estate collateral  problem loan management practices and collection procedures  and nonaccrual and charge off guidelines 
commercial loans primarily represent loans made to businesses  and may be made on either a secured or an unsecured basis 
collateral is ordinarily taken unless the borrower has strong cash flows  low debt to worth ratios  and the loan is of short duration 
when taken  collateral usually consists of liens on receivables  equipment  inventories  furniture and fixtures 
unsecured business loans are generally short term with emphasis on repayment strengths and low debt to worth ratios 
commercial lending involves significant risk because repayment usually depends on the cash flows generated by a borrower s business  and the debt service capacity of a business can deteriorate because of downturns in national and local economic conditions 
to control risk  initial and continuing financial analysis of a borrower s financial information is required 
real estate construction loans generally consist of financing the construction of family dwellings and some nonfarm  nonresidential real estate 
usually  loan to cost ratios are limited to and permanent financing commitments are required prior to the advancement of loan proceeds 
loans secured by real estate mortgages comprised nearly of the bank s loan portfolio at december  residential real estate loans consist mainly of first and second mortgages on single family homes  with some multifamily loans 
loan to value ratios for these instruments are generally limited to 
nonfarm  nonresidential loans are secured by business and commercial properties with loan to value ratios generally limited to 
the repayment of both residential and business real estate loans is dependent primarily on the income and cash flows of the borrowers  with the real estate serving as a secondary or liquidation source of repayment 
consumer loans generally involve more risks than other loans because of the type and nature of the underlying collateral  or because of the absence of collateral 
consumer loan repayments are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability and are likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce and illness 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans in the case of a default 
in most cases  any repossessed collateral will not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance 
nonperforming loans  other problem assets when a loan is days past due as to interest or principal or there is serious doubt as to collectibility  the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued unless the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to assure collection of the principal balance and accrued interest 
when the collectibility of a significant amount of principal is in serious doubt  the principal balance is reduced to the estimated fair value of collateral by charge off to the allowance for loan losses and any subsequent collections are credited first to the remaining principal balance and then to the allowance for loan losses as a recovery of the amount charged off 
a nonaccrual loan is not returned to accrual status unless principal and interest are current and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to continue making payments as agreed 
at december   the company had eight loans totaling  on non accrual status 
net income for includes no interest income on these loans 
had these loans been current in accordance with their original terms   of additional interest income would have been recorded in at december   the company had twelve loans totaling  on non accrual status

potential problem loans management has identified and maintains a list of potential problem loans 
these are loans that are neither included in non accrual status  nor loans that are past due days or more and still accruing 
a loan is added to the potential problem list when management becomes aware of information about possible credit problems of borrowers that causes serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms 
on december  the total amount of loans determined by management to be potential problem loans was  this amount consisted of loans made to ten borrowers 
real estate owned the company foreclosed on real estate collateral during the year ended december  and transferred the loans and accrued interest balances at the time of foreclosure to other real estate owned in the amount of  during the year ending december   there was no activity regarding foreclosure on real estate collateral 
however during the year ending december   the net affect of foreclosure on real estate collateral totaled  resulting in an ending balance for other real estate owned for december   of  allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by direct charges to operating expense 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which management has determined that it is more likely than not such amounts have become uncollectible 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the table  summary of loan loss experience  summarizes loan balances at the end of each period indicated  averages for each period  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by loan category  and additions to the allowance which have been charged to expense 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each year end  management took into consideration the historical loan losses experienced by the company  current economic conditions affecting the borrowers ability to repay  the volume of loans  and the trends in delinquent  nonaccruing  and potential problem loans  and the quality of collateral securing nonperforming and problem loans 
after charging off all known losses  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover its estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  in calculating the amount required in the allowance for loan losses  management applies a consistent methodology that is updated quarterly 
the methodology utilizes a loan risk grading system and detailed loan reviews to assess credit risks and the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
also  the calculation provides for management s assessment of trends in national and local economic conditions that might affect the general quality of the loan portfolio 
for outstanding loans  the risk rating system is the major factor employed to quantify the probable losses in the loan portfolio 
predetermined percentage factors for dollars outstanding in each loan grade are applied and then totaled 
for loans specifically identified by management during loan reviews  management separates these loans from the general pool of loans and assigns a separate risk rating for these loans based on the likelihood of collectibility  financial condition of the borrower  value of collateral  and other relevant factors 
two additional calculations are based on fdic classifications and daily statement loan type total using factors as noted below 
the four methods for measuring probable losses are performed monthly and their results averaged to provide an amount to be established as a reserve against loan losses 
the monthly reserve provisions  and the details supporting the calculations utilized in the computation  are reviewed by the board s loan committee and the board of directors 
the factors used in these calculations were initially derived from prior experience with similar systems at other banks 
these factors have been  and will continue to be  modified as the bank s actual historical loss experience in different economic environments can be fully incorporated into a predictive model 
regulators also review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as part of their examination of the bank and may require adjustments to the allowance based upon information available to them at the time of the examination 
management also performs periodic reviews of the company s off balance sheet credit risks  such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
when these reviews identify a probable loss  a separate loss reserve is established 
the review performed at december   as well as those performed throughout the year  did not identify an off balance sheet risk upon which a reserve should be established

wholesale time deposits involve the maintenance of an appropriate matching of maturity distribution and a diversification of sources to achieve an appropriate level of liquidity 
such deposits are generally more volatile and interest rate sensitive than other deposits 
borrowed funds major sources of borrowed funds in and  other than deposits  were retail repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances

adequate liquidity is necessary to meet the requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals in the most timely and economical manner 
some liquidity is ensured by maintaining assets which may be immediately converted into cash at minimal cost amounts due from banks and federal funds sold

inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed  determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
while the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also general increases in the prices of goods and services usually result in increased operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements the company  through the operations of the bank  makes contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of its business activities
