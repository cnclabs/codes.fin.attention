non gaap financial measure return on investment roi is an important internal measure for us because it is a key component of our evaluation of overall performance and the performance of our business segments 
studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between shareholder value and roi and that shareholder value is created when roi exceeds the cost of capital 
roi allows us to evaluate our performance on a consistent basis as the amount we earn relative to the amount invested in our business segments 
a significant portion of senior management s compensation is based on achieving roi targets 
in evaluating overall performance  we define roi as operating income  adjusted for significant unusual items  divided by parent company total assets  less certain assets and certain current liabilities 
in evaluating segment performance  we define roi as segment operating income divided by segment assets less segment current liabilities 
we do not believe there is a comparable gaap financial measure to our definition of roi 

table of contents the reconciliation of our roi calculation to amounts reported under gaap is included in a later section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
despite its importance to us  roi is a non gaap financial measure that has no standardized definition and as a result may not be comparable with other companies measures using the same or similar terms 
also there may be limits in the usefulness of roi to investors 
as a result  we encourage you to read our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements and note a to the parent company and financial services summarized financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results  and they are difficult for us to apply 
within the parent company  they include asset impairments and pension accounting  and within financial services  the allowance for loan losses 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that we have to make currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have discussed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in our intentions  market conditions  or operating performance could require us to revise the impairment charges we previously provided 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  currently percent  consideration is given to both historical returns and our estimate of returns over the next quarter century 
the actual rate of return on plan assets for the last ten years was percent 
another important consideration is the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations  currently percent 
differences between actual and expected rates of return and changes in the discount rate will affect future pension expense and funded status 
for example  a basis point change in the estimated expected rate of return would affect annual pension expense by million  and a basis point change in the discount rate would affect the funded status by million and annual pension expense by million 
allowances for loan losses are based on historical experiences and evaluations of future cash flows and collateral values and are subject to regulatory scrutiny 
changes in general economic conditions or loan specific circumstances will inevitably change those evaluations 
as a result of the sale of our third party mortgage servicing portfolio in  accounting for mortgage servicing rights is no longer considered a critical accounting estimate 
new accounting pronouncements and change in method of accounting for defined benefit and postretirement plans in the last three years  we adopted a number of new accounting pronouncements  including in  statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised december share based payment and sfas no 
accounting for defined benefit and postretirement plans 
in addition  there are four new accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in and  none of which we expect to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
please read note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents results of operations for the years   and summary our mission is to be the best by consistently exceeding customer expectations  maximizing asset utilization  lowering operating costs  and improving efficiency 
we are a market driven  customer focused company 
our four key strategies are focusing on corrugated packaging from an integrated platform  which eliminates mill downtime and lowers costs through improved asset utilization  maximizing the value of our timberland through accelerated fiber growth that is aligned with well located converting operations  creating value from real estate  including high value land  and realizing earnings and cash flow from financial services  which is a low cost  low risk provider of financial products 
actions we took in to implement our key strategies included we classified our real estate operations as a fourth business segment 
previously these operations were included within our forest products and financial services segments 
this action increased the visibility and transparency of our real estate operations 
we purchased our joint venture partner s percent interest in standard gypsum lp  which expands our low cost gypsum wallboard operations located close to fast growing markets 
we sold our performance sheets corrugated packaging facility to reduce costs and improve asset utilization 
we sold our financial services asset based lending operations and further repositioned our mortgage origination operations to lower cost and reduce risk 
a summary of our consolidated results follows for the year dollars in millions  except per share consolidated revenues income from continuing operations income from continuing operations  per diluted share roi in  significant items affecting income from continuing operations included we continued to see benefits in our manufacturing operations from our initiatives to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies 
we experienced improved markets for our corrugated packaging and forest products  principally gypsum wallboard and particleboard 
we acquired our partner s percent interest in standard gypsum lp in january 
charges related to facility closures  and environmental remediation at a paper mill site totaled million 
our newly established real estate segment recognized million in gains on two sales of commercial real estate 
our financial services operations continued to benefit from improved credit conditions 
actions taken to lower cost in our financial services operations  associated with the elimination of our wholesale mortgage and asset based lending operations  resulted in charges of million 
new accounting rules increased share based compensation expense million 
we realized one time cash gains of million related to the settlement of tax litigation and million related to the softwood lumber agreement entered into between the us and canada 

table of contents in  significant items affecting income from continuing operations included we continued to see benefits in our manufacturing operations from our initiatives to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies and benefits in our financial services operations from repositioning our mortgage origination and servicing activities 
charges related to facility closures were million 
in connection with the sale of our canadian mdf facility  we recognized a one time tax benefit of million 
hurricanes katrina and rita adversely affected segment operating income by about million due to production downtime and re start expenses 
hurricane related losses and other unusual expenses related to litigation and the early repayment of debt totaled million 
in  significant items affecting income from continuing operations included we began to see benefits in our manufacturing operations from our initiatives to lower costs and improve asset utilization and operating efficiencies 
market demand strengthened  resulting in higher prices for most of our forest products  and prices for corrugated packaging began to improve in the second quarter of the year 
charges related to facility closures were million 
our financial services operations benefited from improved asset quality  which resulted in a recovery of previously recorded provisions for credit losses 
this improvement was partially offset by declining mortgage origination activities 
we recognized a one time tax benefit of million resulting from the settlement of prior years tax examinations 
business segments we currently manage our operations through four business segments corrugated packaging  forest products  real estate  and financial services 
our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates  new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities  loan collateral values particularly real estate  and the strength of the us dollar 
given the commodity nature of our manufactured products  we have little control over market pricing or market demand 
corrugated packaging we manufacture linerboard and corrugating medium that we convert into corrugated packaging and sell in the open market 
our corrugated packaging segment revenues are principally derived from the sale of corrugated packaging products and  to a lesser degree  from the sale of linerboard in the domestic and export markets 
a summary of our corrugated packaging results follows for the year dollars in millions revenues costs and expenses segment operating income segment roi 
table of contents hurricanes katrina and rita adversely affected segment operating results by about million principally related to mill production downtime and re start expenses at our bogalusa  louisiana and orange  texas linerboard mills

linerboard shipments and sales were down in and because more of our production was used in our converting facilities  which is consistent with our strategy to convert more of the linerboard we produce in our own converting facilities 
costs and expenses were up one percent in compared with and up two percent in compared with higher raw material and freight costs were partially offset by lower health care costs and cost reductions attributable to the closure of converting facilities  workforce reductions  and increased mill reliability and efficiency  which resulted in lower maintenance costs and improved raw material yield and energy usage 
fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber recycled fiber energy  principally natural gas freight depreciation health care pension and postretirement the costs of our outside purchases of wood and recycled fiber  energy  and freight fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate in the decrease in depreciation in and was principally due to the closure of converting facilities

we grow timber  cut the timber and convert it into products 
we manufacture lumber  gypsum wallboard  particleboard  fiberboard  and medium density fiberboard mdf 
our forest products segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of these products and  to a lesser degree  from sales of fiber and hunting  mineral  and recreational leases of our timberland 
we also own a percent interest in an mdf joint venture 
in january  we purchased our partner s percent interest in standard gypsum lp  a joint venture that produced gypsum wallboard

table of contents pricing for gypsum wallboard  particleboard  and mdf improved compared with however  pricing for lumber was down and demand and pricing for all products moderated in the last half of due to declines in the housing industry 
it is likely that this trend will continue in gypsum wallboard shipments for were positively impacted by the acquisition of standard gypsum lp in january on a pro forma basis  to reflect the acquisition of standard gypsum  shipments were down three percent compared with comparisons of mdf are affected by the sale of our pembroke mdf facility in second quarter segment operating income also includes for the year in millions our share of gypsum wallboard in and and mdf joint venture operating income mineral and hunting lease income gain on sale of about  acres of conservation timberland gain on sale of about  acres to an affiliated real estate joint venture the operating results from the joint ventures generally fluctuate in relation to the price and shipment changes noted above 
mineral income is generally derived from leases and royalty interests and fluctuates based on changes in the market prices for energy 
it is likely prices will continue to fluctuate in in  we sold about  acres of timber and timberland to a joint venture in which our real estate segment owns percent and an unrelated public company owns the other percent 
this acreage was sold pursuant to the terms of a long standing option agreement  which was about to expire 
the joint venture intends to hold the land for future development and sale 
we recognized about half of the million gain in income in and anticipate recognizing the remainder in the future as this land is sold 
costs and expenses were up percent in compared with and up six percent in compared with the increase in cost in is primarily attributable to the acquisition of standard gypsum lp in january  partially offset by lower wood fiber costs and cost reductions attributable to the sale of our pembroke mdf facility in june fluctuations in our significant cost and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions wood fiber energy  principally natural gas freight chemicals depreciation health care pension and postretirement our goal is to increase use of wood fiber from our timberlands and reduce our reliance on outside purchases 
the cost of our outside purchases of fiber  energy  freight  and chemicals fluctuates based on the market prices we pay for these commodities

it is unlikely that this damage will significantly affect the long term value of our timberlands 
real estate we entitle and develop real estate that we own directly or participate in through ventures 
currently  we have projects in eight states and markets encompassing about  acres  including  acres of high value lands located in georgia  principally near atlanta  and in texas 
we create the infrastructure and secure entitlements on these lands for single family residential  commercial  mixed use  and multi family housing site development

table of contents financial services we own a savings bank  guaranty bank  which includes an insurance agency subsidiary 
guaranty makes up the predominant amount of our financial services segment operating income  revenues  assets  and liabilities 
in general  we gather funds from depositors  borrow money  and invest the resulting cash in loans and securities 
we focus our investing and deposit gathering activities in products and geographic areas that promote a relatively stable source of earnings 
we attempt to minimize the potential effect of interest rate and credit quality cycles by investing principally in adjustable rate residential housing assets and maintaining an asset and liability profile that is relatively unaffected by movements in interest rates 
in general  we do not purchase or write derivative financial instrument contracts other than short term contracts to originate and to hedge mortgage loans that we intend to sell 
in our loan portfolio  we emphasize products in targeted but geographically diverse markets with collateral and rate characteristics that we have significant experience managing and principally invest in assets with adjustable rates or that reprice in three to five years 
our deposit gathering activities are focused in two primary markets  texas and california  both of which offer substantial opportunity for cost effective growth 
we expanded our branch network in both states in by opening five new branches  and we anticipate opening five additional branches in targeting the markets and products in which we participate and avoiding complex financial instruments allows us to limit our infrastructure costs 
we  however  incur substantial costs to operate in a regulated environment and comply with the extensive laws and regulations to which guaranty is subject 
a summary of our financial services results follows for the year dollars in millions net interest income segment operating income a segment roi a segment operating income excludes shared based compensation and charges related to asset impairments and severance reported in financial services summarized financial statements 
net interest income and earning assets and deposits our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  minus the interest we pay for deposits and borrowings and dividends we pay on preferred stock issued by subsidiaries 
our net interest margin is the average yield on our earning assets  calculated by dividing net interest income by our average earning assets for the period 
net interest margin is principally influenced by the relative rates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of noninterest bearing deposits  other liabilities  and equity used to fund our assets 
information concerning our net interest margin follows for the year average yield average yield average yield balance rate balance rate balance rate dollars in millions earning assets interest bearing liabilities impact of noninterest bearing funds net interest margin in general  we position our balance sheet to minimize interest rate sensitivity thereby producing a relatively consistent net interest margin 
as we are currently positioned  if interest rates remain relatively 
table of contents stable  it is likely that our net interest margin will remain near its current level 
however  if interest rates change significantly our net interest margin may decline 
please read item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further information 
our net interest margin in was unchanged from the spread between the interest earned on our earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased principally due to a higher concentration of mortgage backed securities in our portfolio of earning assets 
this decrease was offset by a higher spread between our earning assets and our noninterest bearing funds as a result of increases in market rates 
in and  our net interest margin expanded somewhat  as interest rates rose  because the earning rates on our assets increased more than the average rate we paid for funding 
the following table summarizes the composition of our earning assets and deposits at year end dollars in millions residential housing assets loans held for sale loans securities other earning assets total earning assets residential housing assets as a percentage of earning assets noninterest bearing deposit accounts interest bearing deposit accounts certificates of deposit total deposits residential housing assets declined in due to payments on single family mortgage loans and securities exceeding new single family mortgage loan production and securities purchases 
new loan production was limited in because we eliminated our wholesale mortgage production network in the first quarter 
we are developing the capacity to begin acquiring mortgage loans from some of our correspondent mortgage warehouse borrowers 
however  we do not expect our correspondent lending activities to result in significant acquisitions of loans until late second quarter the correspondent mortgage business is very competitive and the current interest rate environment is not generally conducive to significant production of adjustable rate mortgages  which we generally hold 
as a result  we expect our single family mortgage loans to continue to decline throughout additionally  we expect our mortgage backed securities to continue to decrease if current market pricing for securities does not improve 
the decline in residential housing assets was partially offset by an increase in other earning assets  principally commercial real estate loans  which increased million  and energy loans  which increased million 
the increase in commercial real estate and energy loans is due to our success in recent months in increasing new commercial loan commitments 
we anticipate that our commercial loans will begin to increase in as borrowers draw against approved loan commitments to fund construction and other activities 
in addition  in  we sold our asset based lending operation which decreased other earning assets by million 
we expect the growth in other earning assets to partially offset the decreases in residential housing assets 
it is likely that our earning assets will decline in and that residential housing assets as a percentage of earning assets will continue to decline 
a portion of our residential housing loans consists of adjustable rate mortgages that have various monthly payment options option arms 
these loans generally include the ability to select from fully amortizing payments  interest only payments  and payments less than the interest accrual rate  which can result in negative 
table of contents amortization increasing the principal amount of the loan 
negative amortization is subject to various limitations  typically including a percent maximum principal balance as a percent of original principal balance  which limits the maximum loan to value ratio ltv that can be reached 
we underwrite borrowers on option arms at fully amortizing payment amounts  and the maximum principal balance limitation restricts negative amortization to percent ltv 
at year end  residential housing loans include million of option arms 
we recognized million in in interest income on loans from borrowers that elected negative amortization payment options  million in  and an insignificant amount in additionally  the mortgage backed securities we purchased in and and a portion of the securities we purchased in previous years have option arms as the underlying assets 
the outstanding principal balance of these securities at year end was billion 
of these securities  million were issued by us government sponsored enterprises fnma  fhlmc and billion are senior tranches issued by non agency institutions 
all of the securities bear aaa ratings from nationally recognized securities rating organizations 
in second half  the federal banking regulators  including the office of thrift supervision ots  which supervises guaranty  published guidance on option arm and commercial real estate lending 
the guidance outlines various underwriting and risk management activities appropriate for participating in these lending activities 
we anticipate some changes to our option arm product offerings and risk management processes as a result of the guidance  but do not believe these changes will be significant 
asset quality and allowance for credit losses various asset quality measures we monitor are at year end dollars in millions non performing loans restructured operating lease assets foreclosed real estate non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets ratio allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding we recognized million in in interest income as a result of payoffs received on loans where we had previously applied interest payments received to the carrying amount of the loan  million in and million in our allowance for losses on loans not determined to be individually impaired is based on estimated percentages of losses that have been incurred in the portfolio 
these estimated percentages are based on historical charge off rates adjusted for current market and environmental factors that we believe are not reflected in historical data 
we evaluate these estimated percentages annually and more frequently when portfolio characteristics change significantly 
considerations that influence our judgments regarding the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the amounts charged to expense include economic market conditions affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values for impaired loans  risk characteristics for groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired but we believe have probable potential losses  risk characteristics for homogeneous pools of loans  and other risk factors that we believe are not apparent in historical information 

table of contents the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses for the year in millions balance at beginning of year provision credit for credit losses net charge offs balance at year end allowance for credit losses loan commitment related combined allowance for credit losses we charged off million of loans in  including million related to our asset based lending operation 
the asset based lending charge offs were principally related to a loan to a chemical producer and direct financing leases to an automobile parts manufacturer 
we also recognized recoveries of million  including million related to our asset based lending operation 
we charged off million of loans in  including million of commercial and business loans and million related to our asset based lending operation  and incurred million in commitment related credit losses 
we also recognized recoveries of million 
we charged off million of loans in  including million of real estate loans 
we also recognized recoveries of million  including million related to our asset based lending operation 
in  we restructured two leveraged direct financing leases on cargo aircraft in which we are the lessor  and reclassified the leases as operating leases 
the net carrying value of the aircraft was million at year end  and we anticipate the carrying value will be million at the end of the lease terms in the lessee has made all lease payments in accordance with the restructured terms 
virtually all of our commercial real estate loans are collateralized and performing in accordance with contractual terms 
although the current real estate environment is relatively strong  at times it is necessary for us to extend a loan while a property leases up 
we typically require loans to be current on all interest and other contractual payments and generally require substantial third party guarantees or other credit support to grant such extensions 
it is possible that we will have to foreclose on additional commercial real estate loans in the future 
while the sale of our asset based lending portfolio reduced our overall credit risk  we have experienced growth in our other earning assets  principally commercial real estate and energy loans and it is likely that this growth will continue 
in addition  there is some uncertainty about continued strength in the housing industry 
our non performing loans at year end do not include a million loan to a homebuilder that had characteristics indicating potential credit problems that could result in the loan being classified as non performing in the future 
the quality of our earning assets continues to reflect the strong stage of the credit cycle  although there is some uncertainty as to how long this stage will last 
changes in credit quality are difficult to predict  however  it is likely we will recognize higher levels of provisions for credit losses in future periods 

table of contents information about the geographic distribution and original ltv of our single family mortgage loans follows at year end dollars in millions california texas florida all other states weighted average original ltv we have received very few notices from borrowers in areas affected by the hurricanes regarding property damage or the borrower s ability to pay 
we have not incurred  and do not anticipate  any significant loan losses as a result of these hurricanes 
noninterest income and noninterest expense fluctuations in our noninterest income and expense components included year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest income loan origination and sale of loans amortization and impairment of servicing rights noninterest expense compensation and benefits the decrease in loan origination and sale of loans in was due to the elimination of our wholesale mortgage origination network 
the decrease in was due to the repositioning of our mortgage origination activities and sale of our third party mortgage servicing in late as a result of these repositionings  we do not anticipate significant single family mortgage loan originations or sales until our correspondent operations are in place 
a significant portion of our compensation expense in and was related to our mortgage loan origination activity and was variable with origination volume 
the decrease in was principally a result of the repositioning of our mortgage activities 
the decrease in was principally related to changes in mortgage loan origination volume 
in  we began a program to expand our banking center network by constructing new retail bank branches in key markets 
in future years  these new branches will provide us with additional deposit funding  including noninterest bearing deposits  and will increase our noninterest income  but will also increase our noninterest expense as a result of additional compensation and depreciation expense 
in  we opened five new branches and in  we opened six new branches 
at year end we had two new branches under construction and plans for an additional three new branches in information about our mortgage loan origination activities follows for the year in millions loans originated and retained loans originated for sale to third parties we no longer retain the rights to service loans nor do we retain any other interest in loans sold to third parties 

table of contents please read statistical and other data for additional information about our business segments and bank statistical disclosures 
expenses not allocated to segments unallocated expenses represent expenses managed on a company wide basis and include corporate general and administrative expense  share based compensation  other operating and non operating income expense  and parent company interest expense 
the change in general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase in incentive compensation in  an increase in incentive compensation and supply chain initiatives in  and million in expenses related to our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting mandated by the sarbanes oxley act in the change in share based compensation in was due to an increase in our share price and the implementation of the new share based compensation accounting pronouncement related to awards granted to retirement eligible employees

please read notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in third quarter  the us and canada entered into the softwood lumber agreement 
the agreement essentially provides for the canadian government to impose a sliding export charge that increases as lumber prices decline 
a portion of duties previously collected by the us government has been returned to domestic lumber producers 
in fourth quarter  we received million from this distribution  which is included in other operating income 
other operating income expense not allocated to business segments also includes costs associated with the closure of production and converting facilities and sales of non strategic assets  environmental remediation at a paper mill site  the cost of repositioning our mortgage origination and servicing activities and charges related to the sale of our asset based lending portfolio in our financial services segment  charges related to litigation  costs associated with the gulf coast hurricanes in  and the consolidation of administrative functions in please read note g to the parent company summarized financial statements and note l to the financial services summarized financial statements and item legal proceedings for additional information 
the actions to close facilities  consolidate administrative functions  and reposition our mortgage origination and servicing activities  and sale of our asset based lending operations were taken to lower costs  improve operating effectiveness  increase asset utilization  and as it relates to the mortgage origination and servicing activities and asset based lending  to reduce our exposure to changing market conditions 
we have seen the benefits of these actions over the past three years 
we will continue our efforts to enhance return on investment by lowering costs  improving operating efficiencies  and increasing asset utilization 
as a result  we will continue to review operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determine appropriate courses of action  including possibly consolidating and closing converting facilities and selling under performing assets 
other non operating income expense principally consists of in  a one time gain  after legal fees  of million related to the settlement of tax litigation  in and interest income and other costs associated with debt tender offers  call premiums and write offs of unamortized financing fees related to refinancing of borrowings  and in early repayments of borrowings 
the change in parent company interest expense was due to a change in the mix of our long term debt and higher levels of debt in  principally due to the acquisition of our partner s percent interest in standard gypsum lp

our principal operating cash requirements are for compensation  wood and recycled fiber  energy  interest  and taxes 
over the last three years  we experienced improved pricing and shipments for most of our products 
sources and uses of cash from our discontinued operations  which is principally derived from operating activities  was not significant 
the dividends we receive from financial services are dependent on its level of earnings and capital needs and are subject to regulatory approval and restrictions 
working capital is subject to cyclical operating needs  the timing of collection of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses and  to a lesser extent  to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
in addition  operating cash flows are affected by the timing of the payment of real estate development expenditures and the collection of proceeds from the eventual sale of the real estate 
we issued  net shares of common stock in   net shares in  and  net shares in to employees exercising options 
in addition  in  we issued  shares of our common stock and received million in cash in conjunction with the final settlement of our upper decs sm equity purchase contracts 
we paid cash dividends to shareholders of per share in  per share in  and per share in including a per share special dividend in december 
on february   our board of directors increased the regular quarterly dividend to per share per share on an annual basis 
since february through year end  our board of directors approved repurchase programs aggregating million shares 
as of year end  we had repurchased million shares under these programs including million shares in for million  million of which was included in other 
table of contents current liabilities and was settled after year end 
the repurchased shares were added to treasury shares at an average price of per share in as of year end  there are million shares remaining to be purchased under an august repurchase program 
on february   our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program of up to million shares 
capital expenditures and timberland reforestation and acquisitions were percent of depreciation and amortization in  percent in  and percent in most of the expenditures relate to initiatives to increase reliability and efficiency at our linerboard mills 
capital expenditures and timberland reforestation and acquisitions are expected to approximate million in  or about percent of expected depreciation and amortization 
in january  we used million of our credit facilities to fund the purchase of the remaining percent interest in standard gypsum lp 
following the purchase we paid off million of the venture s long term debt  of which million was related to the purchased interest 
in  market conditions provided the opportunity to lengthen our debt maturity profile in a cost effective manner 
as a result  we issued million of debt due in and million of debt due in the proceeds were used to refinance debt due in and in  we used portions of our available funds to retire higher interest rate debt and long term timber rights purchase obligations 
financial services sources and uses of cash for the year in millions we received cash from operations changes in loans held for sale and other from operations net repayments on loans and securities sale of asset based operations redemption of federal home loan bank stock increase in deposits and borrowings collection of mortgage servicing rights sale receivables total sources we used cash to pay dividends to the parent company a fund decreases in deposits and borrowings fund loans and securities  net reinvest in the business through capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other total uses change in cash and cash equivalents a dividends we pay to the parent company are eliminated in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal operating cash requirements are for compensation  interest  and taxes 
changes in loans held for sale are subject to the timing of the origination and subsequent sale of the loans and the level of refinancing activity 
as a result of the correspondent lending activities that we anticipate in  it is likely that we will use cash flow to acquire loans held for sale during the first several months of those operations  which we would expect to fund with federal home loan bank borrowings 
the changes in deposits and borrowings and the amounts invested in loans and securities generally move in tandem because we use deposits and borrowings to fund our investments 
fluctuations over the last several 
table of contents years are principally due to changes in the volume of refinancing activities as well as the level of suitable commercial lending and securities purchase opportunities 
we anticipate commercial loan growth throughout however  we expect this growth will be more than offset by repayments of single family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
dividends we pay to the parent company were substantially more in than in due to lower requirements for regulatory capital resulting from the sale of our asset based lending operations and the reduction in assets 
the anticipated commercial loan growth in will require us to retain a portion of financial services earnings 
therefore we do not anticipate dividends to the parent company to be as high in as in liquidity and contractual obligations almost all of the net assets invested in financial services are subject to regulatory rules and restrictions including restrictions on the payment of dividends to the parent company 
as a result  all consolidated assets are not available to satisfy all consolidated liabilities 
to provide a clearer understanding of our different businesses  we discuss our contractual obligations for the parent company and financial services separately 
at year end our consolidated contractual obligations separated between the parent company and financial services consist of payments due or expiring by year total thereafter in millions parent company long term debt including current maturities a principal portion of capital lease obligations a less  related municipal bonds we own a contractual interest payments on fixed rate long term debt and capital lease obligations  net of interest on related municipal bonds we own operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities a total parent company financial services transaction and savings deposit accounts a certificates of deposit a federal home loan bank borrowings  repurchase agreements  and other borrowings a subordinated notes payable to trust a preferred stock issued by subsidiaries a contractual interest payments operating leases total financial services total consolidated a denotes items included in our balance sheet 

table of contents parent company liquidity and contractual obligations our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  dividends received from financial services  and borrowings under our credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be repaid from our operating cash flow or from our unused borrowing capacity 
at year end  we had million in unused borrowing capacity under our committed credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility accounts committed receivable credit securitization agreements facility total in millions committed less borrowings and commitments unused borrowing capacity at year end our committed credit agreements include a million revolving credit facility that expires in the remainder of the committed agreements expire in and our accounts receivable securitization facility expires in under this facility  a wholly owned subsidiary purchases  on an on going basis  substantially all of our trade receivables 
as we need funds  the subsidiary draws under its revolving credit agreement  pledges the trade receivables as collateral  and remits the proceeds to us 
in the event of liquidation of the subsidiary  its creditors would be entitled to satisfy their claims from the subsidiary s pledged receivables prior to distributions back to us 
we included this subsidiary in our parent company and consolidated financial statements 
our credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility contain terms  conditions and financial covenants customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage 
at year end  we complied with these terms  conditions  and financial covenants 
none of the agreements are restricted as to availability based on our long term debt ratings 
on february   our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate to per share from per share 
in the s  we entered into two sale lease back transactions of production facilities with municipalities 
we entered into these transactions to mitigate property and similar taxes associated with these facilities 
the municipalities purchased these facilities from us for million  our carrying value  and we leased the facilities back from the municipalities under lease agreements  which expire in and concurrently  we purchased million of interest bearing bonds issued by these municipalities 
the bond terms are identical to the lease terms  are secured by payments under the capital lease obligations  and the municipalities are obligated only to the extent the underlying lease payments are made by us 
the interest rate implicit in the leases is the same as the interest rate on the bonds 
as a result  the present value of the capital lease obligations is million  the same as the principal amount of the bonds 
since there is no legal right of offset  the million of bonds are included in other assets and the million present value of the capital lease obligations are included in other long term liabilities 
there is no net effect from these transactions as we are in substance both the obligor on  and the holder of  the bonds 
operating leases represent pre tax obligations and include million for the lease of particleboard and mdf facilities in mt 
jewett  pennsylvania  which expire in the rest of our operating lease obligations are for timberland  facilities  and equipment 
purchase obligations are pre tax  market priced obligations principally for gypsum and timber used in our manufacturing and converting processes and for major committed capital expenditures 
we have other long term liabilities  principally liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits and deferred income taxes that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities 
at year end  the liability for pension benefits was million and the liability for postretirement benefits was million 
we expect to make voluntary  discretionary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million in we also estimate that we will be required to contribute about million 
table of contents per year over the next five years to fund payments to participants of our supplemental defined benefit plan and health care claims to be paid for participants in our postretirement benefits plan 
please read pension  postretirement medical and health care matters for additional information 
at year end  our deferred income tax liability was million 
we do not expect any significant changes in our deferred tax liability in in  we used all of our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
as a result  beginning in  we will pay federal income taxes at a percent rate as compared with the percent rate we have paid for a number of years 
we have interest rate derivative instruments outstanding at year end these interest rate instruments expire in they are non exchange traded and are valued using either third party resources or models 
at year end  the aggregate fair value of our interest rate instruments was a million liability 
financial services liquidity and contractual obligations our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  new deposits  borrowings under our existing agreements and  if necessary  sales of assets 
assets that can be readily converted to cash  or against which we can readily borrow  include short term investments  loans  mortgage loans held for sale  and securities 
at year end  we had available liquidity of billion 
our contractual obligations due in will likely be repaid from operating cash flow  retention of deposits  and available liquidity 
our transaction and savings deposit accounts are shown as maturing in these accounts do not have a contractual maturity  but rather  are due on demand 
most of the certificates of deposit that mature in are short term one year or less and a high percentage of the depositors have historically renewed at maturity  although they have no contractual obligation to do so 
loans and securities aggregating billion are pledged as collateral on fhlb borrowings 
based upon this collateral  we have the ability to borrow an additional billion from the fhlb  which is included in our available liquidity 
operating lease obligations are principally for facilities and equipment 
it is likely we will redeem  in  the million of preferred stock issued by subsidiaries 
proceeds for the redemption will be raised through the issuance of million of trust preferred securities by a trust we formed in that will lend the proceeds to us in the form of subordinated notes 
we will use other liquidity sources for any interim financing that may be necessary to complete the redemption of the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries before we have raised million through borrowings from the trust 
in  financial services borrowed million from the trust 
these borrowings have a year term and are callable by us after five years

off balance sheet arrangements parent company from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements to facilitate our operating activities 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest payments  operating leases  and purchase and other obligations included in the table of contractual obligations  consisted of expiring by year total thereafter in millions joint venture guarantees performance bonds and recourse obligations we participate in two joint ventures engaged in manufacturing and selling paper and forest products 
our partner in each of these ventures is a publicly held company unrelated to us 
at year end  these ventures had million in long term debt and million of debt included in current maturities  along with various letters of credit 
we guaranteed million of the joint ventures debt service obligations and letters of credit 

table of contents our joint venture partners also provided guarantees and letters of credit 
generally we would be called upon to fund the guarantees due to the lack of specific performance by the joint ventures  such as non payment of debt 
performance bonds and recourse obligations are primarily for workers compensation and general liability claims and real estate development activities 
preferred stock of million issued by two subsidiaries of guaranty is automatically exchanged into preferred stock of guaranty upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events or administrative actions 
if such exchange occurs  certain shares are automatically surrendered to us in exchange for our senior notes and certain shares  at our option  are either exchanged for our senior notes or are purchased by us 
financial services in the normal course of business  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements  such as commitments to extend credit for loans  leases  and letters of credit 
these commitments carry substantially the same risk as loans 
we generally require collateral upon funding of these commitments  and the funded loans generally increase our liquidity by increasing our borrowing capacity 
these commitments normally include provisions allowing us to exit the commitment under certain circumstances 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest and operating leases included in the table of contractual obligations  consisted of expiring by year total thereafter in millions single family mortgage loans unused lines of credit unfunded portion of credit commitments commitments to originate commercial loans letters of credit capital adequacy and other regulatory matters at year end  guaranty met or exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
we expect to maintain guaranty s capital at a level that exceeds the minimum required for designation as well capitalized under the capital adequacy regulations of the ots 
from time to time  the parent company may make capital contributions to or receive dividends from guaranty 
please read note m to the financial services summarized financial statements for additional information 
at year end  guaranty had outstanding preferred stock issued by subsidiaries with a carrying amount and liquidation value of million  which qualifies as regulatory capital with certain limitations 
this preferred stock will be automatically exchanged into guaranty preferred stock if the ots determines guaranty is or will become undercapitalized in the near term or upon the occurrence of certain administrative actions 
if such an exchange were to occur  the parent company must issue senior notes in exchange for the guaranty preferred stock in an amount equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock exchanged 
with respect to certain of these shares  the parent company has the option to issue senior notes or purchase the shares 
at year end  million of the subsidiary preferred stock qualified as core capital and the remainder qualified as tier capital 
we have obtained ots approval to include amounts raised through the subordinated notes payable to trust in regulatory capital similar to the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries upon redemption of the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries 
the federal banking agencies have published for comment potential changes to capital adequacy guidelines and risk weightings 
the ultimate changes that may be applicable to guaranty are not yet known  but we do not anticipate them to result in a change in guaranty s capital categorization 

table of contents pension  postretirement medical and health care matters our non cash defined benefit pension expense was million in  million in  and million in for the year  we expect our non cash defined benefit pension expense to be about million 
for accounting purposes  we measure the defined benefit plans projected benefit obligation and value the plan assets as of september to determine the funded status as of year end 
under new accounting standards  the funded status is included on our balance sheet  beginning year end at year end  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was a liability of million compared with million at year end the change was principally due to an increase in the discount rate and better than expected return on plan assets and larger plan assets due in part to the million of voluntary  discretionary contributions we made in both and unrecognized actuarial losses  which are now included in accumulated other comprehensive income and principally represent the delayed recognition of changes in the assumed discount rate and differences between expected and actual returns  were million at year end and million at year end these losses will be recognized over the remaining service period of about nine years 
we expect about million of these losses will be recognized in pension expense  compared with million that was recognized in pension expense 
we did not have any erisa cash funding requirement in  and we expect our cash funding requirement to be minimal in we made voluntary  discretionary contributions of million to the defined benefit plans in  and it is likely that we will make additional voluntary  discretionary contributions to the defined benefit plans in of million  million per quarter 
passage of the pension protection act of  which requires a minimum level of annual funding  is not expected to affect significantly our annual cash contributions 
for accounting purposes we measure the postretirement medical plans projected benefit obligation as of september to determine the funded status 
at year end  the funded status of these plans was a liability of million compared with million at year end the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
our postretirement benefit plans provide for medical coverage  including a prescription drug subsidy  for certain participants 
the effect of the act was to reduce the liability for postretirement medical cost by million and reduce postretirement medical expense by about million 
in  we implemented a new consumer driven health plan option for our employees 
about percent of our employees elected this option in compared with percent in implementing this option has reduced and helped mitigate our rising health care costs 
in  the total cost of providing health coverage was about million of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
in  the total cost of providing health coverage was about million of which we incurred million and our employees incurred million 
energy and the effects of inflation energy costs increased million in  million in  and million in the increase in energy cost for is primarily attributable to the acquisition of standard gypsum lp in january excluding standard gypsum lp  energy costs in were down by million due primarily to decreases in natural gas usage and prices 
the increase in energy costs for and was principally due to changes in natural gas prices 
our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the last three years 
our fixed assets and timber and timberland are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  depreciation expense and the cost of timber cut or timberland sold would be significantly higher than what we reported 
environmental protection our operations are subject to federal  state  and local provisions regulating discharges into the environment and otherwise related to the protection of the environment 
compliance with these provisions requires us to invest substantial funds to modify facilities to assure compliance with applicable environmental 
table of contents regulations

litigation matters we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
in our opinion  the possibility of a material loss from any of these proceedings is considered to be remote  and we do not expect that the effect of these proceedings will be material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current level of interest rate risk is primarily due to the lending and funding activities of our financial services segment and to a lesser degree to parent company variable rate  long term debt 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose to follow 
this estimate also considers the effect of changing prepayment speeds  repricing characteristics  and expected average balances over the next months 
increase decrease in income before taxes at year end at year end change in parent financial parent financial interest rates company services company services in millions parent company interest rate risk is related to our variable rate  long term debt and our interest rate swaps 
interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in the cost of our variable rate  long term debt 
the parent company interest rate sensitivity change from year end is due to an increase in variable rate debt 
additionally  changes in interest rates will affect the value of our interest rate swap agreements currently million notional amount 
we believe that any changes in the value of these agreements would not be significant 
our financial services segment is subject to interest rate risk to the extent interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repay or reprice at different times or in differing amounts or both 
the change in our interest rate sensitivity from year end is principally a result of migration in deposit balances toward 
table of contents accounts with more responsive interest rates shorter term certificates of deposit and money market deposit accounts with interest rates resetting monthly based upon an index 
foreign currency risk we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on our financial instruments because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of our volume and range in duration from three months to three years 
considering the fair value of these instruments at year end  we believe the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
