item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations conclusion of strategic alternatives review on june   we announced the formation of a special committee of the board of directors the special committee to evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value  including the potential sale of the company 
the special committee retained jp morgan securities inc and deutsche bank securities inc 
as our financial advisors 
on february   the special committee completed its review of strategic alternatives and our board of directors has concluded that  in light of the alternatives available  including non binding indications of value received for the sale of our company  the better alternative at this time to maximize stockholder value  is for management to focus on executing our existing business plan 
we may  without further public announcement  resume our review of strategic alternatives  or  respond to subsequent opportunities created by the strategic alternatives review process 
additionally  on february   our board of directors authorized a securities repurchase program under which we may buy back up to million of a combination of our common stock and convertible senior notes 
the entire million may be used to repurchase common stock  but only million may be used to repurchase our convertible senior notes 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be dependent upon various business and financial considerations 

table of contents effective february   we amended our revolving credit facility to allow for these repurchases 
securities repurchases are subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements and other factors 
overview our collections and revenues during the year ended december  improved as compared to prior years  but were offset by higher operating expenses which resulted in lower overall net income 
results for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are as follows gross collections on receivable portfolios increased million  or  to million revenue  excluding ascension s bankruptcy servicing fees of million  increased million  or  to million 
total revenue increased million  or  to million net income decreased million  or  to million gross collections and revenue  excluding ascension s servicing fee revenue  increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we attribute these increases to stronger collections due to our multiple collection strategies and our disciplined purchasing of receivable portfolios 
in addition  the increase in revenue was due to the extension of our collection forecast from months to months during the second quarter of under our revised unified collection score ucs methodology 
ucs is a proprietary forecasting tool that generates portfolio level expectations of liquidation for portfolios that we own and have serviced for greater than months 
for forecasting portfolios owned and serviced less than six months  we use our proprietary behavioral liquidation score bls model 
the bls methodology forecasts portfolio level expectations based on credit characteristics of the portfolio over a or month period 
we have observed that receivable portfolios purchased during  and prior to  have consistently experienced cash collections beyond months from the date of purchase  in some cases to years from the date of purchase 
when we first developed our cash forecasting models in  limited historical collection data was available with which to accurately model projected cash flows beyond months 
with additional collection data accumulated over the last several years  we have improved the forecasting models and we believe that we have enough collection history to forecast collections to months 
extending the collection forecast in our ucs model from months to months resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios by million  or 
the extension of the collection forecast is being treated as a change in estimate and  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no  is being recognized prospectively in the financial statements 
the decrease in net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of several factors  including the impact of expensing stock options associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r  costs associated with our consideration of strategic alternatives  higher operating expenses associated with our higher volume of gross collections  increased costs associated with new operating initiatives focused on increasing portfolio liquidation  and lower effective accretion rates on collections from portfolios purchased in   and due to a more competitive pricing environment  compared to portfolios purchased in prior years  offset by increased accretion revenue associated with extending our collection forecast from months to months  a reduction in portfolio impairments and increased accretion revenue related to new operating initiatives 
the market for the purchase of unsecured charged off consumer debt has remained competitive and we continue to apply a disciplined approach to purchasing 
our ability to grow revenue will be based on our ability to increase liquidation on our receivable portfolios  which increases our internal rates of return applied to the cost basis of the portfolio  and increases our ability to purchase receivable portfolios that meet or exceed our internal hurdle rates 
we are continuing to diversify our acquisition of portfolios into other asset classes that are somewhat less competitive 
as a result of our recent operating performance  our financial position has improved 
our stockholders equity was million as of december   an increase of million from the 
table of contents million in stockholders equity as of december   driven primarily by our net income of million 
in addition  we had unrestricted cash of million as of december   after borrowing million and repaying million in principal on our debt facilities and purchasing million in receivable portfolios 
we repaid million  and million in debt principal during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in may  we amended our revolving credit facility to extend the termination date to may  reduce the maximum libor spread by basis points  increase the expansion feature to million from million and eliminate and modify certain financial covenants 
the amended revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating rate equal to  at our option  either a reserve adjusted libor plus a spread that ranges from to basis points  depending on the company s leverage  or b the higher of the federal funds rate then in effect plus a spread of basis points or the prime rate then in effect 
the applicable margin is adjusted quarterly based on a pricing grid that takes into account certain financial covenants related to our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations 
the amended revolving credit facility is secured by all of our assets  except for the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  mrc receivables corporation  in which our former secured lender has a first priority security interest 
the amended revolving credit facility provides for an aggregate revolving commitment of million  subject to borrowing base availability  with million sub limits for swingline loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility borrowing base provides for an initial advance rate for the purchase of qualified receivable portfolios 
the borrowing base reduces for each qualifying portfolio by per month beginning after the third complete month subsequent to purchase 
the aggregate borrowing base is equal to the lesser of a the sum of all of the borrowing bases of all qualified receivable portfolios under this facility  as defined above  or b of the net book value of all receivable portfolios acquired on or after january  we may request an increase in the amount of revolving credit commitments  under the expansion feature  to million upon satisfying certain conditions  including acceptance of such increase in commitments by existing or replacement lenders under the facility 
this financing arrangement does not require us to share residual collections with the lender and may be pre paid at any time  in part or in full  without penalty

accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools quarterly groupings of purchased receivable portfolios with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized 
revenue from pools with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
we account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for certain debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
during december  we sold accounts amounting to approximately billion in face value for million 
the accounts sold were purchased in   and under our secured financing facility 
this sale resulted in additional zero basis revenue of million and additional contingent interest expense of million 
the net impact of this sale was to increase pretax income for the year ended december  by million  net income by million and fully diluted earnings per share by 
since the sale of these accounts accelerated collections from future years into  future years collections and the related revenue  operating expenses and contingent interest expense associated with the pool groups from which these accounts were sold  will be reduced

total revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily the result of increased revenue from portfolio purchases during  increased accretion revenue associated with extending our collection forecast from months to months  additional zero basis revenue related to the sale of accounts sold in december as discussed above and increased accretion revenue related to new operating initiatives 
the increase in revenue was offset  in part  by a greater portion of our collections coming from   and purchases that have lower effective accretion rates  due to a more competitive pricing environment than purchases made in prior years and due a reduction in zero basis revenue 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net impairment provision of million on certain of our receivable portfolios 
during the same period in the prior year we recorded an impairment provision of million on certain of our receivable portfolios 
revenue also increased due to us owning ascension for the entire year 
ascension s bankruptcy servicing revenue of million represents twelve months of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the revenue represents only the revenue for the period of time after our acquisition of ascension in august gross collections increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the following table summarizes our portfolio revenue by revenue to collections percentage

table of contents for revenue recognition purposes  portfolios are divided into two groups accrual basis portfolios those that still have a remaining unamortized basis  and zero basis portfolios those portfolios for which the cost basis has been completely amortized 
zero basis revenue represents revenue derived from receivable portfolios whose cost basis has been fully amortized 
when there is no remaining cost basis to amortize  each dollar collected is recognized entirely as revenue 
during the year ended december   million exclusive of million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest was recognized as zero basis revenue  a million decrease from the million exclusive of million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest recognized during the year ended december  we expect the revenue from these portfolios to decline in future quarters as collections from these portfolios diminish 
for additional information on revenue see the supplemental performance data below 
during the year ended december   we invested million for portfolios with face values aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million decrease  or  in the amount invested compared with the million invested during the year ended december  to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value

the decrease in the commission rate as a percentage of the related gross collections is primarily due to the mix of accounts placed with the agencies 
commissions as a percentage of collections in this channel vary from period to period depending on  among other things  the time from charge off of the accounts placed with an agency freshly charged off accounts have a lower commission rate 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of approximately million of increased expenses due to the inclusion of a full year of costs related to the acquisitions of the st

we make estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we record a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense

commencing january   we began accounting for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain debt securities in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
sop limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over our investment in the pool 
the effective interest rate applied to the cost basis of the pool is to remain level  or static throughout the life of the pool unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected are generally recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of a pool s effective interest rate over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the effective interest rate  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool and are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a reduction in revenue with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
as permitted by sop  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are assigned to the pool permanently 
the discount  which is the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance  is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool  similar to one loan  for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to principal of receivable portfolios  and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return as derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool

critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios 
commencing january   the company began accounting for its investment in receivable portfolios in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain debt securities in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
sop limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the company s investment  or cost basis  in the pool 
as permitted by sop  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because the company expects to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
all portfolios with common risk characteristics purchased prior to the adoption of sop were aggregated by quarter of purchase 
in compliance with sop  the company accounts for its investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
the interest method applies an effective interest rate  or internal rate of return irr to the cost basis of the pool  which is to remain level  or unchanged throughout the life of the pool unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s effective interest rate over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the effective interest rate  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a reduction in revenue with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the company accounts for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such portfolios on the cost recovery method cost recovery portfolios 
the accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter  or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and  accordingly  they were not aggregated with other portfolios 
contingent interest 
under the terms of the our secured financing facility  once we repay the lender for the notes for each purchased portfolio and collect sufficient amounts to recoup our initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  then we share the residual collections contingent interest from the receivable portfolios  net of servicing fees  with the lender 
we make estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we record a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on contingent interest 

table of contents deferred revenue 
on august   we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of ascension 
ascension provides bankruptcy administration services primarily to holders of motor vehicle secured loans  on which the debtor has filed for chapter or bankruptcy 
these services are provided subject to the terms of long term contracts 
such contracts generally have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew for yearly periods 
fees for the bankruptcy administration services are charged on a per referred account basis and generally consist of an upfront fee at the time of account referral 
this initial fee is typically coupled with either an ongoing monthly service fee per referred account or service specific fees based on a predetermined fee schedule 
the servicing deliverable for chapter accounts is focused on the completion of the entire bankruptcy process resulting in the most favorable possible conclusion for the customer 
as a result  revenue is deferred and not recognized until the bankruptcy case is closed dismissal discharge 
due to practical limitations and constraints  a historical average life of seven months is used instead of actual closure dates 
therefore  the total financial consideration less efforts applied to litigation for client contracts without a separate litigation fee schedule will be recognized seven months after a referred account is activated 
chapter bankruptcy proceedings  also known as reorganization  are generally designed to restructure an individual s debts and allow them to propose a repayment plan detailing how they are going to pay back their debts over the plan period 
the responsibility of ascension is to ensure that the client s claim is recognized by the court to the maximum benefit of ascension s client  and to monitor and or collect the debtor payments throughout the confirmed bankruptcy plan term 
the average duration period for chapter bankruptcy placements is thirty five months 
given the nature and duration of a chapter proceeding  the monthly servicing deliverable provided relative to a chapter referred account is considered delivered each month and revenue is recognized ratably  including any upfront fees received by the company over time as the services are provided 
the litigation deliverable is an as incurred event  with revenue recognized based on the historical percentage of accounts litigated over the average duration of an account 
any billings in excess of the ratable revenue will be deferred 
the average duration period for chapter and bankruptcy placements are periodically reviewed for changes 
convertible notes hedge

 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  the company recorded the net call options and warrants as a reduction in additional paid in capital as of december   and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the call options and warrants in its consolidated financial statements 
forward flow asset 
in connection with our acquisition of a business in june  we entered into a forward flow agreement to purchase a minimum of billion in face value of credit card charge offs over the next five years at a fixed price 
we allocated million of the acquisition purchase price to this agreement  which is reflected on the consolidated statement of financial condition as forward flow asset 
we allocate a portion of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolio purchases under the forward flow agreement based on the proportion the purchase represents to the total purchase commitment  as adjusted for the time value of money 
we allocated million of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolios purchased during the year ended december  as part of this forward flow agreement  the seller is obligated to sell a predetermined minimum amount of charged off credit card accounts to us 
the forward flow agreement contains penalty provisions if the seller fails to meet such minimum requirements 
any monies received pursuant to such penalty provisions would be applied to the carrying balance of the forward flow asset 
we routinely evaluate the forward flow asset carrying balance for impairment 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related debtor has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has to date been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will be ultimately uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced  or recovered  or that we anticipate recovering 

table of contents income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes

although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we caution you that these expectations or predictions may not prove to be correct or we may not achieve the financial results  savings or other benefits anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are neccesarily estimates reflecting the best judgement of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which may be beyond our control or cannot be predicted or quantified  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
many factors  including but not limited to those set forth in this annual report on form k under part i  item a 
risk factors  could cause our actual results  performance  achievements  or industry results to be very different from the results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by other factors besides those listed here

in addition  it is our policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings  and we do not endorse projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had total variable rate borrowings of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of debt 
changes in short term interest rates also affect our earnings as a result of our borrowings under variable rate borrowing agreements 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase at an average of  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on the amount of related outstanding borrowings as of december  of million 
conversely  if market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense would decrease  thereby increasing income before income taxes by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on borrowings as of december
