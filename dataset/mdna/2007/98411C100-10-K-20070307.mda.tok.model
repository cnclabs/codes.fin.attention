item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates that utilize the body s natural nutrient transporter mechanisms to improve the therapeutic benefits of drugs 
our most advanced product candidate is currently being evaluated in a phase clinical program for the treatment of restless legs syndrome  or rls 
this product candidate has also successfully completed a phase a clinical trial for the management of post herpetic neuralgia  or phn 
our second product candidate has generated positive data in a phase a clinical trial for reducing the number of reflux episodes in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd 
our current portfolio of proprietary product candidates includes the following xp for rls 
xp is a transported prodrug of gabapentin 
xp is currently being evaluated in a phase clinical program for the treatment of rls 
rls is characterized by an irresistible urge to move one s legs  usually accompanied by unpleasant sensations or pain in the legs 
xp for neuropathic pain  including phn 
we have also shown in a phase a clinical trial that xp is effective for the management of phn  a chronic type of neuropathic pain that can follow the resolution of shingles 
xp for gerd and spasticity 
xp is a transported prodrug of r baclofen that is in development for the treatment of gerd  which is a digestive system disorder caused primarily by inappropriate relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter  which is a combination of muscles that controls the junction between the esophagus and the stomach 
gerd is characterized by the frequent  undesirable passage of stomach contents into the esophagus that results in discomfort and potential damage to the lining of the esophagus 
we have successfully completed a phase a clinical trial indicating that single doses of xp were well tolerated and produced statistically significant reductions in the number of reflux episodes in patients with gerd 
xp is also a potential treatment for the symptoms of spasticity 
xp for parkinson s disease 
xp is a transported prodrug of levodopa  or l dopa  that is in preclinical development for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
we plan to file an investigational new drug application  or ind  for xp in the second half of xp for migraine and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
xp is a transported prodrug of propofol that is in preclinical development for the treatment of migraine and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
we plan to continue development of xp at an appropriate time in the future depending on the availability of resources 
we were incorporated in may and commenced active operations in august to date  we have not generated any product revenues 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  non equity payments from collaborative partners  capital lease and equipment financings and government grants 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of development 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we expand our development programs  and  subject to regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the establishment of a north american specialty sales force 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development  we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when we plan to establish a north american specialty sales force 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
from our inception in through  our principal activities were focused on identifying and characterizing natural nutrient transporter mechanisms and developing the technology necessary to utilize them for the active transport of drugs 
beginning in  our activities expanded to include the preclinical and clinical development of internally discovered product candidates based on this proprietary technology 
in addition to our ongoing research program  the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development will require significant additional research and development expenditures  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and regulatory activities 
we outsource a substantial 
table of contents portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials and manufacturing activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
in december  we entered into a collaboration with alza corporation to discover  develop and commercialize transported prodrugs of certain generic parent drugs that are poorly absorbed in the intestines 
this collaboration ended in march alza made an up front  non refundable cash payment upon initiation of the collaboration and provided annual research funding on a full time equivalent employee basis 
in november  we entered into a collaboration with pfizer inc to develop technologies to assess the role of active transport mechanisms in delivering drugs into the central nervous system 
pfizer made an up front payment and supported a number of full time equivalent employees through november the program was exclusive during the term of the collaboration and provided pfizer with non exclusive rights to resulting technologies 
in december  we issued  shares of our series d convertible preferred stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
holders of the series d convertible preferred stock were entitled to receive dividends in shares of series d convertible preferred stock at the rate of per share per annum 
we have reported the loss applicable to common stockholders after giving effect to the dividends paid 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering in june   shares of our series d convertible preferred stock were issued as in kind dividends payable on our series d convertible preferred stock  and all of the outstanding shares of series d convertible preferred stock  including the in kind dividends  were automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
in june  in connection with our initial public offering  we issued  shares of our common stock  raising net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in july  the underwriters partially exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock  for which we received net cash proceeds of approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in december  we entered into an agreement in which we licensed to astellas pharma inc exclusive rights to develop and commercialize xp in japan  korea  the philippines  indonesia  thailand and taiwan collectively referred to as the astellas territory 
we received an initial license payment of million 
the terms of the agreement also specify clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to a maximum of million  including a milestone payment of million upon initiation of our first phase clinical trial of xp in rls patients in the united states  received in april  and million at the completion of our first phase clinical trial of xp in rls patients in the united states 
we will receive royalties on any sales of xp in the astellas territory at a royalty rate in the mid teens on a percentage basis 
to date  we have recognized an aggregate of million of revenue pursuant to this agreement 
in june  in connection with a follow on public offering  we issued  shares of our common stock  raising net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
also in june  the underwriters partially exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in february  we announced an exclusive collaboration with glaxo group limited  or gsk  to develop and commercialize xp worldwide  excluding the astellas territory 
gsk made an up front  non refundable payment to us of million that we received on march   and gsk has agreed to make additional payments of up to million upon the achievement of pre commercialization milestones and up to million upon the achievement of specified sales levels 
under the terms of the agreement  which remains subject to review by the u 
s 
federal trade commission  or ftc  gsk would also be responsible for all future development costs  with the exception of specified development costs that we will assume in connection with the development of xp for rls in the united states 
we would be entitled to receive royalties based upon a percentage of sales of xp in the gsk territory for a specified period of time  unless we elect the option to co promote xp in the united states 
in the event that we elect the co promotion option for xp  we would share marketing and commercialization costs and would be entitled to a share of operating profits from sales of xp in the united states for so long as xp is sold  as well as payments on details we perform in the united states on requip h 
table of contents and requip h  gsk s development stage product candidates for rls and parkinson s disease 
upon fda approval of the new drug application  or nda  for xp  we would co promote xp in the united states to those same prescribers 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our collaboration agreements with astellas  alza and pfizer each contain some or all of the following elements non refundable  up front license fees  research payments for ongoing research and development  payments associated with achieving development and regulatory milestones  payments under a supply agreement  and royalties to be paid based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the elements are separable  whether there are determinable fair values and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front fees ratably over the term of our performance under the agreements 
these payments are recorded as deferred revenue pending recognition 
we recognize revenue related to collaborative research payments as the services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 
generally  the payments received are not refundable and are based on contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
as of december   we had not received payments or recognized revenues for earning royalties on product sales 
grant revenues are recognized as research is performed 
grant revenues are not refundable 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 

table of contents we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
sfas r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  for stock options and stock purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan  or the purchase plan  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock compensation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of apb  and related interpretations  and provided the disclosures required under sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
prior to our initial public offering in june  we had granted certain stock options with exercise prices that were below the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded employee stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation of million 
we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective application method  which was applied to the unvested portion of options granted prior to january  and all options granted after january  the effect of recording stock based compensation under sfas r for the year ended december  was million 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized was million 
this amount will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r  we reassessed our valuation method and related assumptions 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
and with the method used to compute our prior period pro forma disclosures of loss available to common stockholders  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  the single option allocation method and the straight line attribution approach 
upon the adoption of sfas r on january   we reversed all of the existing balance of deferred stock compensation of million with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
sfas r requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
both the expected stock price volatility and the weighted average expected life assumptions were determined using data obtained from similar entities  taking into consideration factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had also used this approach in calculating both expected stock price volatility and weighted average expected life assumptions 

table of contents we account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as costs associated with our drug discovery efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
research and development expenses are comprised of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party manufacturing organizations  where a substantial portion of our preclinical supplies and all of our clinical supplies are produced  and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  and laboratory and other supplies 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
we do not allocate our employee and infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development and the direct  third party research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product candidate 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of current phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion 
the actual timing of completion could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business  we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or commercialize  our product candidates  and if third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed sections of risk factors

table of contents for the year ended december   research and preclinical expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million  office and facilities overhead costs of million and laboratory supplies of million 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in our research and development activities  including the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
while we expect that our total research and development expenses  specifically those expenses related to clinical development activities  will increase in future periods  we expect that our future expenses related to research and preclinical activities will remain relatively consistent with the amounts incurred in each of the years ended december   and the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of at least some of our product candidates 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate  the estimated completion date is largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates

we expect that research and development expenses will increase in the future due to increased clinical development costs primarily relating to our xp and xp programs 
the timing and amount of these expenses will primarily depend upon the costs associated with our phase clinical program in rls for xp and the outcome of future clinical trials for xp  as well as the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product candidate manufacturing costs

our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  offset in part by the impact of non cash depreciation  stock based employee compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities

table of contents we believe that our existing capital resources and expected milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and the extent to which we enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any other collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost of manufacturing clinical and establishing commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the timing  receipt and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from our potential products  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through equity financings  dilution to our stockholders would result

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because our investments are short term in duration  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we contract for the conduct of certain manufacturing activities with a contract manufacturer in europe 
we made payments in the aggregate amount of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  to this european contract manufacturer 
we are subject to exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in connection with these agreements 
to date  the effect of the exposure to these fluctuations in foreign exchange rates has not been material  and we do not expect it to be material in the foreseeable future 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
