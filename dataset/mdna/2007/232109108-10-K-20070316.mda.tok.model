liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our liquidity and cash flows  as well as a discussion of our commitments that existed as of december  executive summary company description 
we are a global medical device company engaged in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and other light based aesthetics systems to the professional aesthetic market 
our easy to use platforms coolglide  xeo and solera enable dermatologists  plastic surgeons  gynecologists  primary care physicians and other qualified practitioners to perform safe  effective and non invasive aesthetic procedures for their customers 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research  regulatory  sales  marketing and administrative activities 
in the united states  we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force of employees as of december  and through a distribution relationship with pss world medical shared services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pss world medical  which has over sales representatives serving physician offices throughout the united states 
in addition  we also sell certain items like titan handpiece refills and marketing brochures via the web 
international sales are generally made through a direct sales force  independent sales representatives and distributors in over countries worldwide 
outside the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france  germany  japan  spain  switzerland and the united kingdom 

table of contents products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  product upgrades  service  and titan handpiece refills 
product revenue represents the sale of a system console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser and or other light based module  control system software  high voltage electronics  and one or more handpieces 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications as their practice grows 
this enables customers to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue  which we classify as product upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of pre paid maintenance and support contract revenue and receipts for services on out of warranty products 
titan handpiece refill revenue is associated with our titan handpiece  which requires a periodic refilling process  which includes the replacement of the optical source  after a set number of pulses has been performed 
significant business trends 
we believe that revenue growth has been  and will continue to be  primarily attributable to the following investments made in our global sales and marketing infrastructure  including the expansion of our sales force to increase our market penetration in an expanding aesthetic laser market 
continuing introduction of new aesthetic products and applications 
marketing to physicians outside the core dermatologist and plastic surgeon specialties 
generating service and titan handpiece refill revenue from our growing installed base of customers 
during  our business continued to experience significant growth 
in  compared to  our us revenue grew and our international revenue grew 
in contrast  in  compared to  our us revenue grew by  while our international revenue grew by 
the weaker us revenue growth from to  as compared to to  was primarily attributable to the slow ramp up of revenue from newly hired sales representatives 
the stronger international revenue growth from to  compared to to  was primarily attributable to significant revenue growth coming from canada  japan  and switzerland 
the growth in revenue from switzerland was attributable to the setting up of our european hub office in zurich in july  from where we coordinate our european marketing and service activities 
we believe that  amongst other factors  if and when we obtain fda marketing clearance for our ysgg based laser technology  our revenue will be positively impacted 
for  our gross margin declined to  compared to in this decrease was primarily attributable to the royalty expense recorded with effect from april  due to the settlement of our litigation with palomar  which was of net revenue in  and to higher stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r with effect from january  given our royalty expense and stock based compensation expense will continue in  we expect our gross margin for to be similar to general and administrative expenses for  compared with  increased by million  or  to million and were of net revenue 
in  we expect our g a expenses to decrease and be in the range of approximately of revenue 
this expected decrease is primarily attributable to the following expenses which were included in g a in but not expected to be incurred in million of legal expenses related to the patent litigation matter and an estimated charge of  relating to a liability for sales taxes in jurisdictions that we had believed we did not have a taxable presence 
factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
additionally  the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain 
table of contents regulatory clearances for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
if we fail to compete effectively  fail to continue to develop new products and technologies  fail to obtain regulatory clearances  fail to protect our intellectual property  fail to produce our products cost effectively  or fail to market and distribute our products in a profitable manner  our business could suffer 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in part i  item a risk factors section 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include  stock based compensation expense  revenue recognition  valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of warranty obligations and valuation of income taxes on earnings 
such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including stock options  employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock unit awards 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december  based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model and elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas the block scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility  expected term of stock option and risk free interest rate 
due in part to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its interpretations and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas as 
table of contents amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair market value of our stock and the exercise price 
employee stock based compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying options 
revenue recognition we recognize distributor and non distributor revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectibility has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 
total deferred revenue for service contracts was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   was  compared with  as of december  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary  to reflect changes in raw material costs  labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates 
our inventories balance was million as of december  and our inventories allowances as of december  were  compared with  as of december  we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory allowances are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventories 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of 
table of contents obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product is sold 
warranty obligations we provide a standard one year warranty coverage on our systems and from time to time have promotional offers when we offer a twenty four month warranty 
warranty coverage provided is for labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale  and as reviewed and updated quarterly  of the total costs that we expect to incur in repairing or replacing product parts that fail while still under warranty 
accrued warranty costs include costs of material  technical support labor and associated overhead 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends 
the accrued balance for product warranties was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for more information on warranty reserves  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future due to actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differing from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would negatively impact our operating results 
provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential loss from such contingencies  and may be adjusted from time to time in light of changing facts and circumstances 
these reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate 
the provision for taxes on earnings includes the effect of changes to these reserves that are considered appropriate 
in addition  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets 
earnings derived from our international regions are generally taxed at different rates than in the united states 
our effective rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
a change in the mix of total earnings from our united states operations and the respective international regions among particular tax jurisdictions could change our effective income tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes  should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items 
table of contents for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of implementing sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently assessing the impact that sfas may have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab requires the quantification of misstatements based on their impact on both the balance sheet and the income statement to determine materiality 
the guidance provides for a one time cumulative effect adjustment to correct for misstatements that were not deemed material under a company s prior approach but are material under the sab approach 
sab no 
has not had any impact on our annual financial statements for the year ended december  in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or sfas this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation is effective for us in the first quarter ending on march  based on a preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting this interpretation  we believe that it will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations in

in addition  the overall revenue growth was attributable to the expansion of our direct sales force and the penetration of customer bases outside the core specialties of dermatologists and plastic surgeons 
service revenue continued to increase as a result of an increase in our installed base of customers purchasing extended service contracts 
growth in titan handpiece refills reflected increased adoption of the titan product by new and existing customers as well as an increased consumer demand for titan procedures 
upgrade revenue declined in and was flat in  due primarily to an increase in the number of customers choosing to purchase a new system from our solera platform  instead of upgrading their existing systems 
we believe that  amongst other factors  if and when we obtain fda marketing clearance for our ysgg based laser technology  our revenue will be positively impacted 
international revenue growth in was primarily attributable to growth from canada  japan and switzerland 
the growth in revenue from switzerland was attributable to the setting up of our european hub office there in july in  compared to  the slower international growth was primarily attributable to reduced sales to a national chain of clinics in japan  who purchased systems for all their members beginning in early and ending in the first quarter of gross margin year ended december  dollars in thousands change change gross margin as a percentage of total revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor  employee stock based compensation  royalty expense  warranty  and manufacturing overhead expenses

in  given the litigation settlement expense resulted in a significantly lower level of income before income taxes  the impact of deductible permanent items r d tax credits  tax exempt interest income and deductions for disqualifying incentive stock option exercises resulted in a substantially more pronounced impact on our effective income tax rate  as they represented a larger percentage of our income before income taxes

table of contents contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for minimum lease payments related to facility leases 
payments due by period s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipal bonds and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity interest reset date for auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes of generally less than eighteen months 
for maturities of our marketable investments  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  would have potentially declined by we have international subsidiaries and operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
we cannot assure that there will not be a material impact in the future 
although the majority of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion
