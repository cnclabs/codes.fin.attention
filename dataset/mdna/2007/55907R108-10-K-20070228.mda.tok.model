item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we define ebitda  which is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  in the following schedules as net income plus provision for income taxes  debt prepayment premiums  write off of unamortized debt placement fees  debt placement fee amortization  interest expense net of interest income and capitalized interest  minority interest expense and depreciation and amortization and excluding non cash gains on derivative instruments 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda excludes some items that affect net income and these items may vary among other companies  the ebitda data presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
our management uses ebitda as a performance measure to assess the viability of projects and to determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income  the nearest comparable gaap measure  is included in the following schedules 
in addition to ebitda  the non gaap measure of operating margin in the aggregate and by segment is presented in the following tables 
we compute the components of operating margin by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  is included in the following tables 
see note segment disclosures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating margin to segment operating profit 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin is an important measure of the economic performance of our core operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in deciding how to allocate mmp s capital resources between segments 
operating profit  alternatively  includes expense items such as depreciation and amortization and g a cost  that management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we own and control magellan gp  llc  which is the general partner of magellan midstream partners  lp mmp  a publicly traded limited partnership 
mmp is principally engaged in the transportation  storage and distribution of refined petroleum products 
our only cash generating asset is our ownership interest in mmp s general partner  which owns the following the general partner interest in mmp  which currently entitles us to receive approximately of the cash distributed by mmp  and of the incentive distribution rights in mmp  which entitle us to receive increasing percentages  up to a maximum of  of any incremental cash distributed by mmp as certain target distribution levels are reached in excess of per mmp unit in any quarter 
since we own and control magellan gp  llc  we reflect our ownership interest in mmp on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with magellan gp  llc s and mmp s financial results 
the publicly held limited partner interests in mmp are reflected as minority interest expense in our results of operations 
we currently have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by mmp  and our operating cash flow will be derived solely from cash distributions from mmp 
our consolidated financial statements do not differ materially from the results of operations of mmp 
accordingly  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of mmp 
please read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  significant events initial public offering 
prior to february  we were a private partnership 
our initial public offering of million of our limited partner units  or approximately of the total limited partner units outstanding  was held on february  when our units began trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol mgg 
the net proceeds from this initial public offering were distributed to mgg midstream holdings  lp  the owner of our general partner and approximately of our limited partner units 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  mmp s partnership agreement was amended to remove the requirement for magellan gp  llc to maintain its general partner interest in mmp in any future offering of mmp s common units representing limited partner interest in it mmp limited partner units 
in addition  mmp s partnership agreement was amended to restore the incentive distribution rights to the same level as before an amendment made in connection with mmp s october pipeline system acquisition  which reduced the incentive distributions paid to magellan gp  llc by million for  million for and million for in return  we made a capital contribution to mmp on february  equal to the present value of the remaining reductions in incentive distributions  or million 
recent developments distribution 
on january  the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the period of october through december  this distribution is higher than the per unit initial quarterly distribution reflected in our initial public offering prospectus in february the per unit distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record on february  total distributions paid were million

overview of mmp as of december  mmp s three operating segments including its petroleum products pipeline system  which is primarily comprised of an  mile petroleum products pipeline system  including terminals  petroleum products terminals  which principally includes seven marine terminal facilities and inland terminals  and ammonia pipeline system  representing an  mile ammonia pipeline and six associated terminals 
mmp s petroleum products pipeline system and petroleum products terminals generate substantially all of its cash flows 
the revenues generated from these petroleum products businesses are significantly influenced by demand for refined petroleum products 
operating expenses are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on mmp s pipeline and stored in its terminals 
expenses resulting from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
for further discussion of indemnified environmental matters  see business environmental safety under item of this annual report on form k 
a prolonged period of high refined product prices could lead to a reduction in demand and result in lower shipments on mmp s pipeline system and reduced demand for its terminal services 
in addition  fluctuations in the prices of refined petroleum products impact the amount of cash mmp s petroleum products pipeline system generates from its third party supply agreement and its petroleum products blending and fractionation operations 
also  increased maintenance regulations  higher power costs and higher interest rates could decrease the amount of cash mmp generates 
see item a risk factors for other risk factors that could impact our or mmp s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
petroleum products pipeline system 
mmp s petroleum products pipeline system is comprised of a common carrier pipeline that provides transportation  storage and distribution services for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gases in states from texas through the midwest to colorado  north dakota  minnesota  wisconsin and illinois 
through direct refinery connections and interconnections with other interstate pipelines  mmp s petroleum products pipeline system can access more than of the refinery capacity in the continental united states 
the pipeline generates approximately of its revenues  excluding the sale of petroleum products  through transportation tariffs for volumes of petroleum products it ships 
these tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates  where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts 
all interstate transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the pipeline also earns revenues from non tariff based activities  including leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers on a long term basis and by providing data services and product services such as ethanol unloading and loading  additive injection  custom blending and laboratory testing 
in general  mmp does not take title to the products it transports 
however  mmp does take title to products related to its petroleum products blending and fractionation operations  its third party supply agreement and in connection with the operations of its pipeline system and terminals 
although mmp s petroleum products blending and fractionation operations and third party supply agreement generate significant revenues  we believe the gross margin from these activities  which takes into account the related product purchases  better represents its importance to our results of operations 
petroleum products terminals 
mmp s petroleum products terminals segment is comprised of marine and inland terminals  which store and distribute gasoline and other petroleum products throughout states 
mmp s marine terminals are large storage and distribution terminals that are strategically located near major refining hubs along the us gulf and east coasts and principally serve refiners and large end users of petroleum products 
mmp earns revenues at its marine facilities primarily from storage and throughput fees 
mmp s inland terminals are part of a distribution network located principally throughout the southeastern united states 
these inland terminals are connected to large  third party interstate pipelines and are utilized by retail suppliers  wholesalers and marketers to transfer gasoline and other petroleum products from these pipelines to trucks  railcars or barges for delivery to their final destination 
mmp earns revenues at its inland terminals primarily from fees it charges based on the volumes of refined petroleum products distributed from these locations and from ancillary services such as additive injections 
ammonia pipeline system 
mmp s ammonia pipeline system transports and distributes ammonia from production facilities in texas and oklahoma to various distribution points in the midwest for use as an agricultural fertilizer 
mmp generates revenues principally from volume based fees for the transportation of ammonia on its pipeline system 
effective february  mmp entered into an agreement with a third party pipeline company to operate its ammonia pipeline system 
operating costs and expenses charged to mmp are principally fixed costs related to maintenance and field personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on the pipeline 
acquisition history mmp has significantly increased its operations over the past three years  including the following acquisitions in november and december  the acquisition of two terminals on its petroleum products pipeline system  located in wichita  kansas and aledo  texas  in september  the acquisition of a marine terminal near wilmington  delaware  in october  the acquisition of a  mile petroleum products pipeline system  in march  the acquisition of a ownership interest in a crude oil pipeline company  and in january  the acquisition of six inland terminals and the remaining ownership interest in eight terminals 
organic growth projects mmp also has increased its operations through organic growth projects that expand or upgrade its existing facilities 
during  mmp spent million on organic growth projects  which was more than double its spending on these projects 
further  mmp expects to spend approximately million in on projects that are currently underway or in advanced stages of development and million in to complete these projects 
mmp s current organic growth is driven by a number of economic and business factors  including growing demand for refined petroleum products in the markets currently served by mmp s petroleum products pipeline system and petroleum products terminals  new government regulations  including the reduction of sulfur in diesel fuel and increasing usage of ethanol and biodiesel as fuel additives  which require mmp to add infrastructure on which it will earn additional profits  refinery expansions in the mid continent and gulf coast regions  which require additional pipeline capacity to deliver the increased production  and increased petroleum storage demand driven by increased imports and mmp s customers desire for security of supply  providing mmp opportunities to build additional storage tanks along its petroleum products pipeline system and at its petroleum products terminals 
results of our operations the results of our operations discussed below principally reflect the activities of mmp 
because our financial statements consolidate the results of mmp  our financial statements are substantially similar to mmp s 
the differences in our financial statements primarily include the following interest of non controlling partners in mmp 
our consolidated balance sheet includes minority interests of subsidiary that reflect the proportion of mmp owned by its partners other than us 
similarly  the ownership interests in mmp held by its partners other than us are reflected in our consolidated income statement as minority interest expense 
minority interests of subsidiary and minority interest expense are not reflected on mmp s financial statements  fair value adjustments to mmp s assets and liabilities 
our june acquisition of interests in mmp was recorded as a purchase business combination under the push down method of accounting 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments to the historical cost reflected on mmp s balance sheet for the fair value of our proportionate share of mmp s assets and liabilities at the time of our acquisition 
these fair value adjustments further result in certain differences between our income statement and mmp s income statement  as the depreciation  amortization  accretion or write off of certain assets and liabilities is based on different values  our capital structure 
in addition to incorporating the assets and liabilities of mmp  our consolidated balance sheets include our own historical indebtedness and related debt placement costs as well as mmp s  and the partners capital on our balance sheet represents our partners capital as opposed to the capital reflected on mmp s balance sheet  which reflects the ownership interests of all of its partners  including its owners other than us 
consequently  our income statements reflect additional interest expense  interest income and debt amortization expense that is not reflected on mmp s financial statements  non cash interest income 
during may  we and mmp entered into an indemnification settlement with mmp s former affiliate  which is discussed in more detail under environmental below 
we recorded a receivable from this former affiliate on our consolidated balance sheet in connection with this indemnification settlement at its discounted present value  and we are recording the accretion of the discount as interest income on our consolidated income statement until the final payment in july these items are not reflected on mmp s financial statements  except that mmp records a capital contribution from us when payments pursuant to the indemnification settlement are made to mmp by its former affiliate  and our g a expenses 
we incur general and administrative g a expenses that are independent from mmp s operations and are not reflected on mmp s consolidated financial statements 
our results prior to do not reflect the incremental g a expenses we expect to incur  including those resulting from being a public company  which we expect to be approximately million per year 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin  which is presented in the tables below  is an important measure used by mmp s management to evaluate the economic performance of mmp s core operations 
this measure forms the basis of mmp s internal financial reporting and is used by its management in deciding how to allocate capital resources between segments 
operating margin is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  but the components of operating margin are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  also is included in the tables below 
operating profit includes expense items  such as depreciation and amortization and g a expenses  which management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  variance year ended december  favorable unfavorable change change financial highlights in millions  except operating statistics revenues transportation and terminals revenues petroleum products pipeline system petroleum products terminals ammonia pipeline system intersegment eliminations total transportation and terminals revenues product sales affiliate management fees total revenues operating expenses petroleum products pipeline system petroleum products terminals ammonia pipeline system intersegment eliminations total operating expenses product purchases equity earnings operating margin depreciation and amortization expense affiliate g a expense operating profit operating statistics petroleum products pipeline system transportation revenue per barrel shipped transportation barrels shipped million barrels petroleum products terminals marine terminal average storage utilized million barrels a inland terminal throughput million barrels ammonia pipeline system volume shipped thousand tons a for the year ended december   represents the average storage capacity utilized for the four months mmp owned its wilmington  delaware facility million barrels and the average storage capacity utilized for the full year at its other marine terminals million barrels 
transportation and terminals revenues increased by million resulting from higher revenues for each of mmp s business segments as shown below an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million primarily attributable to record annual shipments due to higher diesel fuel and gasoline shipments as a result of increased demand from mmp s customers and a higher average transportation rate per barrel shipped  principally related to its mid year tariff increase 
mmp also earned more ancillary revenues related to additive and terminal services during  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million due in part to additional revenue from mmp s wilmington  delaware marine terminal  which it acquired in september  and revenue from two marine terminal variable rate storage agreements in mmp has negotiated a similar variable rate storage agreement in  pursuant to which it will receive a discounted storage rate fee plus a share of any net trading profits above a specified level during  but mmp will not share in any net trading losses 
mmp expects revenue from the agreement to be less than the million realized in revenues also increased at mmp s inland terminals due to higher additive fees and record throughput volumes and at its marine terminals primarily due to higher storage rates and additive fees and expansion projects completed over the past year  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million due to higher tariffs associated with mmp s new transportation agreements  which became effective july   and increased volumes 
operating expenses increased by million 
each of mmp s business segments incurred additional expenses as follows an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  primarily due to system integrity spending for pipeline testing and personnel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by more favorable product overages in the current period  principally reflecting higher commodity prices and sales of accumulated system overages  which reduce operating expenses  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million primarily related to expenses associated with mmp s wilmington marine terminal  which it acquired in september  and higher power and personnel costs at its other terminals  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million primarily related to higher system integrity costs and environmental expenses 
mmp expects the amount of system integrity spending to continue to increase in on its ammonia system due to the timing of high consequence area testing mandated by federal regulations 
product sales revenues primarily resulted from mmp s third party product supply agreement  petroleum products blending operation  system product gains and transmix fractionation 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in gross margin from these transactions of million 
the gross margin resulting from product sales and purchases for the period increased million compared to gross margin for the period of million  resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the gross margin increase in primarily resulted from the impact of high gasoline prices on mmp s petroleum products blending operation  partially offset by lower margin from the third party supply agreement primarily due to a lower weighted average inventory cost from that favorably impacted results 
as previously disclosed  the gross margin mmp realizes on these activities can be substantially higher in periods when refined petroleum prices increase and substantially lower in periods when product prices decline or stabilize given that mmp follows an average inventory valuation methodology which results in each period s product purchases being influenced by the value of products held in that period s beginning inventory 
operating margin increased million  primarily due to revenues from a variable rate storage agreement  incremental operating results from mmp s recently acquired wilmington marine facility and improved utilization and financial results from mmp s other assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million related to mmp s asset acquisitions and capital improvements over the past year 
affiliate g a expenses increased by million 
this increase was primarily related to i our incremental costs associated with being a public company since february  ii expense we recognized associated with certain distribution payments made over the past three years by mgg midstream holdings  lp to an executive officer of magellan gp  llc  who left the company during the fourth quarter of  and iii mmp s equity based compensation program  which impacted g a expenses by million during and million during the higher compensation expense resulted from the increase in mmp s unit price during the current period and increases in the number of units management estimates will vest under this equity based incentive compensation program 
g a expenses also were higher during due to higher employee costs and additional personnel hired to help manage mmp s expansion projects 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  primarily due to lower average debt balances during the current period 
the average consolidated debt outstanding  excluding fair value adjustments for interest rate hedges  decreased to million during from  million during primarily due to the retirement of our term loan in december the weighted average interest rate on consolidated borrowings  after giving effect to the impact of associated fair value hedges  increased to for the period from for the period primarily due to rising interest rates 
the amount of capitalized interest in the current period associated with mmp s capital spending program also increased  further reducing the net interest expense in interest income was million during compared to million in  a decline of million  primarily as a result of our and mmp s lower cash balances and our lower imputed interest income recognized on smaller amounts to be received pursuant to the may indemnification settlement 
we will continue to recognize imputed interest income on amounts due under this settlement until july  when the final scheduled payment will be received 
minority interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  primarily related to mmp s improved financial results 
while we had no refinancing costs in  the period included million of write offs of unamortized debt placement fees associated with refinancing our debt during june then retiring it during december net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or

for the year ended december   represents the average storage capacity utilized for the four months mmp owned its wilmington  delaware facility million barrels and the average storage capacity utilized for the full year at its other marine terminals million barrels 
transportation and terminals revenues increased by million resulting from higher revenues for each of mmp s business segments as shown below an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million primarily attributable to revenues from mmp s october pipeline system acquisition 
in addition  its existing pipeline system experienced higher revenues because of increased diesel fuel shipments 
further  mmp earned more ancillary revenues related to services such as additives  ethanol blending  terminal services and management fee income  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million 
the period benefited from mmp s east houston marine terminal  which was acquired as part of its pipeline system acquisition in october  and its wilmington marine facility  which was acquired in september revenues at mmp s other marine terminals increased as well due to higher storage capacities  utilization and rates 
increased throughput and higher additive fees at its inland terminals further benefited the period  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million 
higher tariffs associated with new transportation agreements  which became effective july   more than offset reduced volumes 
the lower volumes primarily reflect customers continued maintenance of tight inventory levels due to increased production costs as a result of higher natural gas prices in operating expenses increased by million 
each of mmp s business segments incurred additional expenses as follows an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  primarily attributable to operating costs associated with the pipeline system mmp acquired in october increased expenses related to higher environmental accruals associated with historical incidents  power costs and system integrity spending for tank maintenance and pipeline testing also impacted the period  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million 
expenses increased due to operating costs associated with the acquisitions of mmp s east houston and wilmington marine facilities 
in addition  expenses were higher because of environmental accruals associated with historical incidents  asset retirements and property taxes  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  primarily attributable to increased system integrity costs and higher property taxes due to an adjustment that positively impacted the period 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in gross margin from these transactions of million 
the gross margin resulting from product sales and purchases for the period increased million compared to gross margin for the period of million  resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the gross margin increase in primarily resulted from the impact of very high and increasing gasoline prices on mmp s petroleum products blending and fractionation operations and the third party supply agreement mmp assumed as part of the pipeline assets it acquired in october equity earnings increased by million due primarily to increased shipments on mmp s owned crude oil pipeline company that it acquired in march and a full year ownership in compared to months in operating margin increased million  primarily due to incremental operating results associated with acquisitions  higher gross margin from product sales and improved utilization of mmp s other assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million related to mmp s asset acquisitions and capital improvements 
affiliate g a expenses increased by million 
this increase was primarily attributable to additional g a personnel and costs resulting from mmp s october pipeline system acquisition 
higher equity based incentive compensation expense during the period was partially offset by transition costs associated with mmp s separation from the former owner of its general partner during the period 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the average consolidated debt outstanding  excluding fair value adjustments for interest rate hedges  increased to  million during from million during primarily due to the financing associated with mmp s october pipeline system acquisition and our additional borrowings 
further  the weighted average interest rate on consolidated borrowings  after giving effect to the impact of associated fair value hedges  increased to for the period from for the period primarily due to rising interest rates 
interest income increased from million for the period to million for the period primarily attributable to a full year of interest income recognized on the amounts owed under the may indemnification settlement 
minority interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase related to mmp s improved financial results coupled with an increased percentage of mmp s limited partner units being owned by the public in the period 
as of december   the public owned all of mmp s limited partner units compared to at december  net financing costs were million during compared to million during  a decrease of million 
we refinanced our debt during june then retired it during december  resulting in million of write offs of unamortized debt placement fees 
the costs included a million debt prepayment premium related to the early extinguishment of a portion of mmp s senior notes and million of write offs for unamortized debt placement fees associated with this retired debt and our debt  which was also refinanced during partially offsetting these charges was a million gain on the ineffective portion of an interest rate hedge related to the mmp refinancing 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million increase in cash flows from operating activities between and was primarily attributable to increased net income  net of non cash minority interest expense  of million in  a million increase in cash from operations relative to net changes in inventories 
although inventories increased million in over  that increase was million less than the million increase in inventories during the increase in inventories during is primarily due to higher natural gas liquids purchases in december initiated to take advantage of favorable product prices at that time  while the increase in primarily resulted from the third party supply agreement mmp assumed in connection with its october pipeline system acquisition  and  a million increase in cash inflows relative to net changes in accounts payable and accrued product purchases 
the increase is primarily due to the timing of invoices received from mmp s vendors and suppliers 
the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities between and was primarily attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash from operations was reduced due to increased accounts receivable and inventory coupled with lower cash collateral  all primarily related to the third party supply agreement mmp assumed as part of its october pipeline system acquisition 
partially offsetting these reductions was increased operating margin due to incremental operating results associated with recent acquisitions  higher gross margin from product sales and improved utilization of mmp s other assets 
notwithstanding the increase in operating margin  net income in decreased million compared to  with this decrease primarily attributable to a million increase in non cash minority interest expense in as a result of the sales of our remaining limited partner interests in mmp during net cash used by investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  mmp spent million for capital expenditures  of which million was for maintenance capital and million was for expansion capital 
significant expenditures of expansion capital during included new tanks at mmp s galena park  texas terminal  new pipeline construction and pipeline connections  equipment to comply with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel mandates  additions to delivery racks and ethanol blending equipment 
during  mmp acquired a marine terminal in wilmington  delaware for million and two petroleum products pipeline system terminals in wichita  kansas and aledo  texas for million on a combined basis 
in addition  mmp spent million to buy out of obligations related to a portion if its third party supply agreement and million for capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
these cash expenditures were partially offset by sales of marketable securities which  net of purchases  generated million of cash in during  net investments in marketable securities by us and mmp used million of cash 
in addition  mmp acquired the following assets during i ownership in petroleum products terminals located in the southeastern united states for million  ii a ownership in a crude oil pipeline company for million  and iii petroleum products pipeline system assets for million plus million of incurred transaction costs and million for inventory 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used during primarily reflects million of distributions by us to our owners and unitholders and million of distributions by mmp to its owners other than us  partially offset by million of net proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash used during primarily reflects million of distributions by us to our owners and million of distributions by mmp to its owners other than us  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of our remaining mmp limited partner units 
a capital contribution of million received to retire our debt outstanding at the time and borrowings more than offset debt payments during cash provided during was principally attributable to financings completed by mmp in connection with its october pipeline system acquisition and its may refinancing  including million net borrowings by mmp after debt placement costs and prepayment premiums and million of net proceeds to mmp from issuances of additional mmp limited partner units to the public 
in addition  we received net proceeds of million from our sales of mmp limited partner units and net proceeds from our borrowings of million after debt placement costs 
partially offsetting these amounts were distributions of million by us to our owners and distributions by mmp of million to its owners other than us 
in february  we received a quarterly distribution of million related to our ownership of the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in mmp associated with the fourth quarter of as a result  in february we paid a quarterly distribution of for each of our limited partner units for the fourth quarter of if we continue to pay cash distributions at this current level and the number of outstanding units remain the same  total cash distributions of million will be paid to our unitholders in capital requirements historically  we have not had any material capital requirements separate from those of mmp  and we do not expect to in the future 
mmp s businesses require continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations 
capital spending for mmp s businesses consists primarily of maintenance capital expenditures  such as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and expansion capital expenditures to acquire additional complementary assets to grow mmp s business and to expand or upgrade its existing facilities  which we refer to as organic growth projects 
organic growth projects include capital expenditures that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources 
during  mmp s maintenance capital spending was million  excluding million of spending that would have been covered by indemnifications settled in may and million for which mmp expects to be reimbursed by insurance 
including the million payment received on july   mmp has received million to date under an indemnification settlement agreement with a former affiliate 
please see environmental below for additional discussion of this indemnification settlement 
for  mmp expects to incur maintenance capital expenditures for its existing businesses of approximately million  excluding million of maintenance capital that would have been covered by the indemnification discussed above and million mmp expects to receive from insurance reimbursements 
in addition to maintenance capital expenditures  mmp also incurs expansion capital expenditures at its existing facilities 
during  mmp spent approximately million for organic growth projects 
based on projects currently underway or in advanced stages of development  mmp currently plans to spend million on organic growth capital in  excluding future acquisitions  and approximately million in to complete these projects 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity for funding interest payments  operating expenses and obligations to mmp has historically been cash distributions we receive from mmp  as well as cash retained from the net proceeds of sales by us of limited partner interests in mmp and net proceeds from borrowings 
we have sold all of our limited partner units in mmp 
cash generated from operations is mmp s primary source of liquidity for funding debt service  maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions 
additional liquidity for purposes other than quarterly distributions is available through borrowings under mmp s revolving credit facility discussed below  as well as from other borrowings or issuances of debt or limited partner units 
if capital markets do not permit mmp to issue additional debt and equity  mmp s business may be adversely affected and it may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses 
as of december   total debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet was million  as described below 
the difference between this amount and the million face value of our outstanding debt is due to adjustments associated with the fair value hedges mmp has in place for a portion of its outstanding senior notes and unamortized discounts on its debt issuances  as well as fair value adjustments to mmp s debt for the step up accounting treatment we recorded when we acquired general and limited partner interests in mmp during our debt as of december   we had no debt outstanding other than mmp s debt  which is consolidated on our financial statements 
affiliate note payable 
in february  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with mgg midstream holdings  lp as the lender 
the facility was available exclusively to fund our working capital borrowings 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the facility 
the borrowings under the facility matured on december   and in january we entered a facility with similar terms that matures on december  borrowings  if any  under the facility will bear interest at libor plus  and we pay a commitment fee to mgg midstream holdings  lp on the unused portion of the working capital facility of 
other than borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  mgg midstream holdings  lp s term loan restricts our ability to incur debt  however  we have the ability to replace this facility with a similar facility

june term loan 
in june  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions that provided for a million term loan 
proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the million outstanding balance of our december term loan  to fund a defeasance account  pay related fees and expenses and make a distribution to our affiliate owners 
in december  we used proceeds from a capital contribution from mgg midstream holdings  lp to retire the june term loan 
december term loan 
in december  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions that provided for a million term loan 
proceeds from the loan were used to repay the million outstanding balance of a previous term loan  to pay related fees and expenses and make a distribution to our owners 
the balance of this loan outstanding at december was repaid with the proceeds of our june term loan discussed above 
mmp s debt mmp s debt is non recourse to us and its general partner 
magellan pipeline notes 
magellan pipeline entered into a private placement debt agreement with a group of financial institutions for million of fixed rate senior notes  comprised of million of series a notes and million of series b notes 
mmp repaid all of the series a notes in and it made scheduled payments on the series b notes of million on october  and million on october  the face value of the notes outstanding on december  was million 
the maturity date of the notes is october   therefore  mmp has classified these notes as current liabilities on its december  consolidated balance sheet 
mmp anticipates refinancing this debt prior to its maturity in october the weighted average interest rate for the notes  including the impact of the swap of million of the notes from fixed rate to floating rate  was approximately at december  mmp guarantees payment of interest and principal by magellan pipeline 
the note purchase agreement under which these notes were issued  as amended in may  requires magellan pipeline to maintain specified ratios of i consolidated debt to ebitda of no greater than to  and ii consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least to 
it also requires mmp to maintain specified ratios of i consolidated debt to ebitda of no greater than to  and ii consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least to 
in addition  the note purchase agreement contains additional covenants that limit magellan pipeline s ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  encumber its assets  make debt or equity investments  make loans or advances  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate  liquidate or dissolve  sell or lease a material portion of its assets  engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions and change the nature of its business 
mmp is in compliance with these covenants 
revolving credit facility 
mmp s current revolving credit facility has a borrowing capacity of million 
the facility s maturity date is may and the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is libor plus a spread that ranges from to based on mmp s credit ratings and amounts outstanding under the facility 
borrowings under this credit facility are unsecured 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility  and million of the facility was obligated for letters of credit 
the obligations for letters of credit are not reflected as debt on mmp s consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this facility was 
the revolving credit facility requires mmp to maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt to ebitda of no greater than to in addition  the facility contains other covenants limiting mmp s ability to incur additional indebtedness or modify its other debt instruments  encumber its assets  make certain investments  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  merge  consolidate  liquidate  dissolve or sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets or change the nature of its business

the indentures under which both the and notes were issued do not limit mmp s ability to incur additional unsecured debt 
the indentures contain covenants limiting  among other things  mmp s ability to incur indebtedness secured by certain liens  engage in certain sale leaseback transactions  and consolidate  merge or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets 
mmp is in compliance with these covenants 
interest rate derivatives 
mmp utilizes interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
mmp was engaged in the following interest rate derivative transactions as of december  in september and november  mmp entered into a total of million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against variability of future interest payments on a portion of the debt mmp anticipates issuing no later than october proceeds of the anticipated debt issuance will be used to refinance the magellan pipeline notes  which mature in october the interest rate swap agreements have a year term  which matches the expected tenor of the anticipated debt 
the effective date of the agreements is october   at which time the agreements require a mandatory cash settlement 
the fixed rate provided in the agreements is  assuming no changes in swap spreads between the date we entered these agreements and the date we settle these agreements  these agreements will effectively fix the rate on the treasury component of our anticipated debt issuance at approximately  in october  mmp entered into a million interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of mmp s senior notes due this agreement effectively changes the interest rate on million of those notes to a floating rate of six month libor plus  with libor set in arrears 
this swap agreement expires on october   the maturity date of the senior notes  and in may  mmp entered into million of interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the magellan pipeline senior notes 
these agreements effectively change the interest rate on million of the senior notes from a fixed rate of to a floating rate of six month libor plus  with libor set in arrears 
these swap agreements expire on october   the maturity date of the magellan pipeline senior notes 
credit ratings 
mmp s current credit ratings are bbb by standard and poor s and baa by moody s investor services

for purposes of this table  we have assumed that the borrowings under mmp s revolving credit facility as of december  million will not be repaid until the maturity date of the facility in october mmp s magellan pipeline notes mature in october and their million carrying value at december  was classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
mmp intends to refinance this debt with year notes prior to its october maturity 
mmp has an agreement with mgg gp to provide its direct operating and g a services 
this agreement has provisions for termination upon day notice by either party 
as a result of the termination provisions of this agreement and the requirement by mmp to pay only actual costs as they are incurred  we are unable to determine the actual amount of this commitment 
the amount mmp paid for allocated operating and g a costs during was million 
mmp has an agreement to supply a customer with up to approximately  barrels of petroleum products per month until the agreement expires in related to this supply agreement  mmp has entered into a separate buy or make whole agreement with a supplier for  barrels of product per day through may  under the terms of this buy or make whole agreement  if mmp does not purchase all of the barrels specified in the agreement  mmp s supplier will sell the deficiency barrels in the open market 
mmp is required to reimburse its supplier for any amounts in which they sell these deficiency barrels at prices lower than specified in the buy or make whole agreement 
we have not included any amounts in the table above for this commitment because mmp is unable to determine what the amounts of that commitment will be 
on december   mmp had outstanding interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the fair value of million of its long term debt 
further  on december   mmp had outstanding million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability of future interest payments on a portion of the debt it anticipates issuing no later than october because future cash outflows under these agreements  if any  are uncertain  they have been excluded from this table 
represents amounts mmp has accrued for equity based incentive compensation through december  based on when those existing liabilities will be settled 
management expects the amounts that will ultimately vest to these employees will exceed these amounts primarily due to anticipated compensation liabilities that will be recognized over the remainder of the vesting periods and changes in mmp s limited partner unit prices between december  and the date the unit awards actually vest 
on december   mmp entered into a year agreement to reach contractual endpoint as defined in the agreement for remediation sites 
this contract obligates mmp to pay the remediation costs incurred by the contract counterparty associated with these sites up to a maximum of million 
the amounts in the table above include the remaining amounts to be paid under this agreement million and the estimated timing of these payments 
during  mmp entered into a separate year agreement with an independent contractor to remediate certain of mmp s environmental sites 
this contract obligated mmp to pay million over a year period 
mmp incurred million of costs associated with this agreement during the amounts in the table above include the remaining amounts to be paid under this agreement million and the contractually determined timing of those payments 
environmental various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which mmp conducts its operations subject mmp to environmental laws and regulations 
mmp has accrued liabilities for estimated site restoration costs to be incurred in the future at its facilities and properties  including liabilities for environmental remediation obligations at various sites where mmp has been identified as a possible responsible party 
under its accounting policies  mmp records liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of amounts recorded for environmental liabilities involves significant judgments and assumptions by management 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in determining environmental liabilities  it is reasonably possible that the actual amounts required to extinguish these liabilities could be materially different from those mmp has recognized 
prior to may  mmp s former affiliate provided indemnifications to mmp for assets mmp had acquired from it 
in may  we and mmp entered into an agreement with the former affiliate under which the former affiliate agreed to pay mmp million to release it from those indemnification obligations 
including the million payment received on july   mmp has received million pursuant to this agreement and expects to receive the remaining balance of million on july  as of december   known liabilities that would have been covered by these indemnifications were million 
in addition  mmp has spent million through december  that would have been covered by these indemnifications  including million of capital costs 
mmp has not reserved the cash received from this indemnity settlement and has used it for its various other cash needs  including capital expansion spending 
during the third quarter of  mmp entered into an agreement with a contractor to mitigate against the risk of increases in certain of its existing environmental liabilities 
the agreement requires that the contractor assume responsibility for the environmental remediation of certain sites and purchase cost cap insurance from an insurance company 
mmp is an additional named insured under that policy and was required to pay the related insurance premium 
in connection with this agreement  mmp increased the related environmental liabilities by million  to equal the discounted value of the cash payments to be made to the contractor pursuant to the agreement  and recorded million of expense to reflect risk and insurance premiums paid for a total charge of million in at the time of our investment in mmp  we assumed obligations to indemnify mmp for million of known environmental liabilities 
through december   we have paid the entire million to mmp 
therefore  we no longer have an obligation related to these environmental indemnities 
in july  the environmental protection agency epa  pursuant to section of the clean water act the act served an information request to mmp s former affiliate with regard to petroleum discharges from its pipeline operations 
that inquiry primarily focused on magellan pipeline  which mmp subsequently acquired 
the response to the epa s information request was submitted during november in march  mmp received an additional information request from the epa and notice from the us department of justice doj that the epa had requested the doj to initiate a lawsuit alleging violations of section b of the act in regards to releases 
the doj stated that the maximum statutory penalty for the releases was in excess of million  which assumes that all releases are violations of the act and that the epa would impose the maximum penalty 
the epa further indicated that some of those releases may have also violated the spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of section j of the act and that additional penalties may be assessed 
in addition  mmp may incur additional costs associated with these releases if the epa were to successfully seek and obtain injunctive relief 
mmp responded to the march information request in a timely manner and has entered into an agreement that provides both parties an opportunity to negotiate a settlement prior to initiating litigation 
mmp has accrued an amount for this matter based on its best estimates that is less than million 
most of the amounts mmp has accrued for this matter were included as part of the environmental indemnification settlement mmp reached with its former affiliate see note commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
due to the uncertainties described above  it is reasonably possible that the amounts mmp has recorded for this environmental liability could change in the near term 
mmp s management is in ongoing discussions with the epa  however  it is unable to determine with any accuracy what mmp s ultimate liability could be for this matter 
adjustments from amounts mmp currently has recorded to the final settlement amounts reached with the epa could be material to our results of operations or cash flows 
in february  mmp received notice from the doj that the epa had requested the doj to initiate a lawsuit alleging violations of sections and of the act with respect to two releases of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia pipeline owned by mmp and operated by a third party 
the doj stated that the maximum statutory penalty for alleged violations of the act for both releases combined was approximately million 
the doj also alleged that the third party operator was liable for penalties pursuant to section of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla for failing to timely report the releases and that the statutory maximum for those penalties could be as high as million 
mmp is evaluating whether or not it has an indemnity obligation to the third party operator for all or a portion of the cercla penalties 
additionally  the doj stated in its notice to mmp that it does not expect mmp or the third party operator to pay the penalties at the statutory maximum and that it may seek injunctive relief if the parties cannot agree on any necessary corrective actions 
mmp is currently in discussions with the epa and doj regarding these two releases  however  mmp does not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
polychlorinated biphenyls pcb impacts 
mmp has identified pcb impacts at one of its petroleum products terminals that it is in the process of delineating 
it is possible that in the near term after mmp s delineation process is complete  the pcb contamination levels could require corrective actions 
management is unable at this time to determine what these corrective actions and associated costs might be 
however  the costs of these corrective actions could be material to mmp s results of operations and cash flows 
other items pipeline tariff increase 
the ferc regulates the rates charged on interstate common carrier pipeline operations primarily through an index methodology  which establishes the maximum amount by which tariffs can be adjusted 
the ferc reviews this approved methodology on a periodic basis 
during march  the ferc approved the methodology of producer price index for finished goods ppi fg plus for the annual adjustment related to the next five year period  commencing july  based on an actual annual change in ppi fg of approximately  the mid year adjustment resulted in an allowed increase on indexed tariffs of approximately 
mmp increased virtually all of its published tariffs by approximately effective july  preliminary data estimates ppi fg for to be approximately 
once ppi fg is finalized  mmp would expect to increase the majority of its tariffs by the resulting ppi fg plus on july  galena park marine terminal expansion 
during late and early  mmp executed a series of long term terminalling agreements with several customers pursuant to which mmp will construct new storage tanks at its galena park  texas marine terminal 
construction is complete for of the tanks which will be operational for all of and mmp expects the remaining new tanks to be placed into service at intervals during the remainder of and in we believe these new agreements will significantly contribute to mmp s and our results of operations and cash flows once construction is complete and all new tanks have been placed into service 
unrecognized product gains 
mmp s operations generate product overages and shortages 
when mmp experiences net product shortages  it recognizes expense for those losses in the period in which they occur 
when mmp experiences product overages  mmp has product on hand for which it has no cost basis 
therefore  these overages are not recognized in our financial statements until the associated barrels are either sold or used to offset product losses 
the combined unrecognized product overages for mmp s operations had a market value of approximately million as of december  however  the actual amounts recognized in future periods will depend on product prices at the time the associated barrels are either sold or used to offset future product losses 
postretirement benefit obligations 
assuming market conditions remain constant  mmp expects to contribute million  million and million in  and  respectively to fund its postretirement pension obligations  which primarily include pension benefits for employees supporting mmp s operations 
in addition  we will fund retiree medical obligations as claims are made 
state tax issues 
texas legislators recently passed a law that  without amendment  will impose a partnership level tax beginning in based on the financial results of mmp s assets apportioned to the state of texas 
while mmp currently expects its tax obligation to be less than million per year  this tax will impact the amount of cash available for mmp to pay as distributions to its unitholders  including us 
if other states create a similar tax  the impact could be material to our results of operations or cash flows 
contract expiration 
in connection with mmp s october acquisition of a petroleum products pipeline system  mmp entered into three year terminalling and transportation agreements with the seller for average minimum revenue commitments of approximately million per year through september  mmp currently expects to retain most of this revenue 
however  if mmp is unsuccessful in retaining this business  it could have a significant impact on our revenues  results of operations and cash flows after the current contracts expire 
impact of inflation inflation is a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and mmp s existing agreements  mmp has and will continue to pass through increased costs to its customers in the form of higher fees 
critical accounting estimates our management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed and approved these disclosures 
environmental liabilities the environmental liabilities we recognize on our consolidated balance sheets are related to mmp s operations  with certain fair value adjustments associated with our acquisition of mmp in june mmp estimates the liabilities associated with environmental expenditures based on site specific project plans for remediation  taking into account prior remediation experience 
remediation project managers evaluate each known case of environmental liability to determine what associated costs can be reasonably estimated and to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements 
we believe the accounting estimate relative to environmental remediation costs to be a critical accounting estimate for all three of mmp s operating segments because estimated expenditures  which will generally be made over the next to years  are subject to cost fluctuations and could change materially  as remediation work is performed and additional information relative to each specific site becomes known  cost estimates for those sites could change materially  unanticipated third party liabilities may arise and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations could significantly increase the amount of the liability 
a defined process for project reviews is integrated into mmp s system integrity plan 
specifically  mmp s remediation project managers meet once a year with accounting  operations  legal and other personnel to evaluate  in detail  the known environmental sites associated with each of mmp s operating segments 
the purpose of the annual project review is to assess all aspects of each project  evaluating what actions will be required to achieve regulatory compliance  estimating the costs associated with executing the regulatory phases that can be reasonably estimated and estimating the timing for those expenditures 
during the site specific evaluations  all known information is utilized in conjunction with professional judgment and experience to determine the appropriate approach to remediation and to assess liabilities 
the general remediation process to achieve regulatory compliance consists of site investigation delineation  site remediation and long term monitoring 
each of these phases can  and often does  include unknown variables that complicate the task of evaluating the estimated costs to completion 
each quarter  mmp re evaluates its environmental estimates taking into account any new incidents that have occurred since the last annual meeting of the remediation project managers  any changes in the site situation and additional findings or changes in federal or state regulations 
the estimated environmental liability accruals are adjusted as necessary 
changes in our environmental liabilities since december  were as follows in millions balance january  accruals expenditures amortization of fair value adjustment other balance december  accruals expenditures amortization of fair value adjustment balance december  in may  mmp entered into an agreement with williams under which williams agreed to pay mmp million to release it from environmental and certain other indemnification obligations it had made to mmp 
from the effective date of mmp s environmental indemnification settlement agreement  all accrual adjustments associated with amounts that would have been previously indemnified are no longer reimbursed and therefore impact mmp s and our net income 
during  mmp increased its environmental liability accruals by million  of which million was related to pipeline product releases  million was related to acquisitions and the remainder was primarily attributable to mmp s annual site assessment process 
mmp s accruals included million of amounts it recorded as accounts receivable from insurance carriers 
during  mmp increased its environmental liability accruals by million 
this increase was due to accrual increases related to pipeline product releases of million  changes in cost estimates of million and costs associated with a cost cap insurance policy of million  as a result of entering into a year agreement with an independent contractor to remediate a number of mmp s environmental sites 
the remainder of the accrual increase was primarily attributable to mmp s annual site assessment process 
environmental liabilities at december  are based on estimates that are subject to change  and any changes to these estimates would impact our results of operations and financial position 
for example  if our environmental liabilities increased by as much as and assuming that none of this increase was covered by indemnifications or insurance  our expenses would increase by million 
because we pay no income taxes  operating profit would decrease by the same amount which represents a decrease of of our operating profit  minority interest expense would decrease by million and net income would decrease by million  or of our net income for this would have the impact of reducing basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would not materially impact our liabilities  equity or liquidity 
depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment consist primarily of pipeline  pipeline related equipment  storage tanks and terminal facility equipment 
property  plant and equipment are generally stated at cost except for impaired assets and assets recorded in transactions designated as the acquisition of a business 
impaired assets are recorded at fair value on the last impairment evaluation date for which an adjustment was required 
property  plant and equipment purchased under transactions accounted for as acquisition of businesses are recorded at fair value 
when we acquired our interest in mmp in june  we recorded mmp s property  plant and equipment at our ownership interest on the date of the acquisition of fair value and of historical carrying value 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset 
at december  and  the gross book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively  and we recorded depreciation expense of million and million during and  respectively 
the determination of an asset s estimated useful life takes a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
mmp s terminals  pipelines and related equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years  and with the step up in basis we recorded  the weighted average asset life is approximately years 
if the estimates of these asset lives changed such that the average estimated asset life was years  our depreciation expense for would increase by million and operating profit would decrease by the same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and  assuming mmp s net income allocation for the fourth quarter of  net income would reduce million or 
this would have the impact of reducing basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would not materially impact our liabilities  equity or liquidity

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing or method of settlement 
thus  the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin no 
was required to be adopted no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december   with retrospective application for interim financial information permitted 
we adopted fin no 
in  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 share based payment  as amended  referred to as sfas no 
r 
this statement and subsequent amendments establish accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this sfas requires that all equity based compensation awards to employees be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  eliminating the alternative to use apb no 
s intrinsic value method 
sfas no 
r was effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that began after december  sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date but was not to be applied to awards granted in periods before the required effective date except to the extent that awards from prior periods were modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective method  we were required to account for all of our equity based incentive awards granted prior to january   using the fair value method as defined in sfas no 
instead of our then current methodology of using the intrinsic value method as defined in apb no 
due to the structure of our awards  we recognized compensation expense under apb no 
in much the same manner as that required under sfas no 
consequently  for the awards granted prior to january   the initial adoption and application of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mmp may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we have established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
mmp also enters into derivative agreements to help manage our exposure to commodity price and interest rate risks 
as of december   mmp had million outstanding on its variable rate revolving credit facility 
mmp had no other variable rate debt outstanding  however  because of certain interest rate swap agreements discussed below  mmp is exposed to interest rate market risk on an additional million of its debt 
million of these interest rate swaps expire in october considering these interest rate swap agreements and the amount outstanding on its revolving credit facility as of december   mmp s annual interest expense would change by million if libor were to change by 
during may  mmp entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the magellan pipeline notes 
mmp has accounted for these interest rate hedges as fair value hedges 
the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements total million 
under the terms of the agreements  mmp receives the interest rate of the magellan pipeline notes and pays libor plus 
these hedges effectively convert million of mmp s fixed rate debt to floating rate debt

the effective date of the agreements is october   at which time the agreements require a mandatory cash settlement 
the fixed rate provided in the agreements is  assuming no changes in swap spreads between the date mmp entered these agreements and the date it settles these agreements  these agreements will effectively fix the rate on the treasury component of mmp s anticipated debt issuance at approximately 
the fair value of these agreements at december  was million which was recorded to other current assets and other comprehensive income
