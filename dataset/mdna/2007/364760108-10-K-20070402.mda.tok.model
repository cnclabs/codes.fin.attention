item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was a challenging year for us 
net sales were billion compared with billion last year  traffic was weak and comparable store sales decreased by percent compared with a decrease of percent last year 
while we saw progress at banana republic where customers responded well to our improved product assortments  product acceptance at gap and old navy brands continued to be a challenge 
as a result  additional promotions and markdowns drove a percent decrease in gross profit from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal piperlime 
com was launched successfully in the third quarter and we opened franchised stores in the middle east and asia 
we invested in marketing and stores in an effort to turnaround our business performance which contributed to a percent increase in operating expenses from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal combined  these factors contributed to a percent decrease in diluted earnings per share of for the weeks ended february  compared with for the weeks ended january  despite these disappointing results  we generated free cash flow of million defined as the net cash provided by operating activities less the purchase of property and equipment for a reconciliation of free cash flow  a non gaap measure  to a gaap measure  see the liquidity section in this management s discussion and analysis 
we utilized our excess cash to repurchase billion of common stock  and increased our annual dividend from per share to per share for a total of million 
in  we are focusing on three priorities fixing our core business by creating the right product and store experience  retaining and developing the best talent in the industry  and examining our organization structure to ensure that we enable our brands to make decisions and effect change more efficiently 
we remain committed to returning excess cash to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases  and maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of our business and to withstand unanticipated business volatility 
since january  we have taken the following actions leadership changes 
our board of directors announced a change in the chief executive officer position 
mr 
robert fisher  our current non employee chairman of the board of directors  stepped in to serve as interim president and chief executive officer 
in addition  we announced marka hansen  former president of banana republic  as the new president of the gap brand and michael cape  former vice president  director of brand marketing for jc penney company  inc  as the new executive vice president of marketing for the old navy brand 
conversion of old navy s outlet stores into old navy stores 
in order to drive improved returns and leverage its existing retail channel  we made the decision in february to convert old navy outlet stores into old navy stores 
we expect the conversion to be completed by october closure of distribution facility 
as part of our on going assessment of network capacity  we made the decision in february to close a distribution facility in hebron  kentucky 
the expenses associated with converting the old navy outlet stores and closing the distribution center are expected to be approximately million in fiscal closure of forth towne 
after a thorough analysis revealed that the concept was not demonstrating enough potential to deliver acceptable long term return on investment  we announced in february that we would close our forth towne stores 
we plan to close all stores by the end of june and expect the pre tax expenses associated with the closure to be approximately million

a store is included in comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales 
stores in which square footage has changed by percent or more as a result of a remodel  expansion  or reduction are excluded from comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales 
current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year comp store sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison

cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points in fiscal compared with fiscal our merchandise margin decreased percentage points  or million  as product acceptance challenges drove additional promotions and markdowns 
in addition  cost of goods sold increased due to a reclassification of certain sourcing costs from operating expenses to cost of goods sold 
while we had been classifying the majority of sourcing expenses in cost of goods sold  certain sourcing expenses had been classified in operating expenses and  as a result  approximately million of year to date sourcing expenses  primarily comprised of payroll and benefit expenses for our wholly owned agent offices  were reclassified during fiscal as a percentage of sales  occupancy expenses increased compared with fiscal primarily due to the decrease in sales for stores that had been open for more than one year 
in addition  occupancy expenses increased due to million recognized in fiscal related to the amortization of key money paid to acquire the rights of tenancy in france 
prior to fiscal  we considered key money an indefinite life intangible asset that was not amortized and  in fiscal  we determined that key money should more appropriately be amortized over the corresponding lease term and recorded million of amortization expense representing the cumulative impact of amortizing our key money balance from fiscal through the end of fiscal the increase was offset by a million decrease in occupancy expenses from a lease accounting adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal to true up amounts which were estimated in our fiscal financial statements 
as a general business practice  we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear the majority of this merchandise

while we have been classifying the majority of sourcing expenses in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses  some operating costs related to certain wholly owned agent offices that source our product had been classified in operating expenses 
as a result  approximately million of year to date sourcing expenses were reclassified in fiscal this reclassification had no effect on net earnings 
lower advertising expenses primarily driven by our decision not to run a holiday television campaign at gap brand and lower bonus expense related to fiscal performance also contributed to the decrease in operating expenses 
operating margin excluding loss on early retirement of debt  was percent  percent  and percent in fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal  we expect operating margin to be in the high single digits 
included in operating expenses are costs related to store closures and sublease loss reserves 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the second fiscal quarter of  we completed our assessment of available space and future office facility needs and decided that we would occupy one of our vacant leased properties in san francisco 
as a result the sublease loss reserve of million associated with this space was reversed in the second fiscal quarter of and we occupied the space in fiscal we further reduced the reserve by million based on our decision to occupy certain additional office space 
loss on early retirement of debt percentage of net sales in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  loss on early retirement of debt in fiscal  we performed a net present value analysis on our outstanding debt and because it was beneficial we repurchased our convertible notes early

interest expense percentage of net sales in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  interest expense the decreases of million and million in interest expense for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of our march redemption of the convertible notes 

table of contents we anticipate that fiscal interest expense will be about million 
interest income weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  percentage of net sales in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  interest income the continued increase in interest income is primarily due to higher yields on our investments 
income taxes weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  percentage of net sales in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  income taxes effective tax rate the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily driven by the absence of the favorable tax settlement realized in related to the us japan income tax treaty 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily driven by the impact of a favorable tax settlement related to the us japan income tax treaty 
we currently expect the fiscal effective tax rate to be about percent due to the more pronounced impact of our japan business  which is subjected to a higher tax rate than that of the us the actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables  including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations  the overall level of earnings  and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies 
financial condition liquidity we consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years in millions february  january  january  working capital a current ratio a net cash provided by operating activities a our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash 
working capital and current ratio as of february  decreased compared with january  due primarily to lower short term investments and the reclassification of the current portion of our long term debt to current liabilities  offset by higher inventory as a result of an increase in stores and square footage 
our short term investments decreased as a result of our share repurchases and capital expenditures  offset by cash from operating activities 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash include personnel related expenses  merchandise inventory purchases  payment of taxes  and occupancy expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million compared with fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in net earnings  higher prepaid taxes and higher inventory levels  offset by an increase in accrued expenses 
for fiscal  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared with fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable mainly as a result of lower merchandise inventory levels  and the decrease in accrued expenses  driven primarily by the decreased bonus payout as a result of fiscal performance 
these decreases were offset by an increase in cash provided by the decreased inventory balance as a result of disciplined inventory management 
inventory management remains an area of focus 
we continue to execute against our strategies to optimize inventory productivity and more tightly manage the receipt and timing of our inventory  while maintaining appropriate in store merchandise levels and product assortment to support sales growth 
inventory per square foot at february  was  a percent increase over fiscal primarily due to the change in shortage trends resulting in a lower shortage estimate 
inventory per square foot at january  was  an percent decrease over fiscal primarily due to earlier spring and later summer product flow in fiscal we fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  peaking over a total of about weeks during the back to school and holiday periods 
during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  these periods accounted for percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our annual net sales 
the seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods 
we expect the percent increase in inventory per square foot at the end of both the first and second quarters of fiscal to be flat compared with last year 
cash flows from investing activities our cash outflows are primarily for purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures  while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short term investments 
net cash used for investing activities for fiscal was million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal this million decrease was driven by the release of million of restricted cash in fiscal as a result of the amendment to our letter of credit agreement  partially offset by million more cash provided by net maturities of investments in fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities increased million compared with fiscal  as our release of restricted cash increased million  offset by million less cash provided by net maturities of investments and million more in capital expenditures 
in fiscal and  capital expenditures totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of these expenditures in both fiscal years were used for new store locations  store remodels and information technology 
for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be about million 
we expect to open about new store locations and to close about store locations 
included in both the expected store openings and closings are old navy outlet stores that will be converted to old navy stores 
as a result  we expect net square footage to increase about percent for fiscal 
table of contents cash flows from financing activities our cash outflows related to financing activities consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock  while cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share based compensation 
for fiscal  cash flows used for financing activities decreased million compared with fiscal  driven by us repurchasing approximately billion less common stock than last year 
for fiscal  cash flows used for financing activities increased million compared with fiscal in fiscal  we repurchased billion of common stock and received million of proceeds from share based compensation 
in fiscal  we repurchased billion of common stock and received million of proceeds from share based compensation 
in addition  we made million of payments for long term debt in fiscal free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap measure 
we believe free cash flow is an important metric  as it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available after the deduction of capital expenditures  as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to keep the business growing 
we use this metric internally  as we believe our sustained ability to increase free cash flow is an important driver of value creation 
the following table reconciles free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to a gaap financial measure 
in millions weeks ended february  weeks ended january  weeks ended january  net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment free cash flow the following table sets forth our reconciliation of projected fiscal free cash flow in millions projected weeks ending february  projected net cash provided by operating activities less projected purchase of property and equipment projected fiscal free cash flow in fiscal  we delivered million in free cash flow  which represented of net earnings 
our earnings continue to generate strong free cash flow 
free cash flow as a percent of net earnings was and for fiscal and  respectively 
for the year ended february   our free cash flow decreased million compared with the prior year primarily due to lower earnings in fiscal we are committed to maintaining sufficient liquidity to support the needs of our business and withstand unanticipated business volatility and plan to keep about billion of cash and investments available 
we will continue to evaluate our billion target over time to reflect the changing needs of our business 
dividend policy in determining whether to  and at what level to  declare a dividend  we considered a number of financial factors  including sustainability and financial flexibility  as well as other factors including operating performance 
table of contents and capital resources 
while we intend to increase dividends over time at a rate greater than our growth in net income  we will balance future increases with the corresponding cash requirements 
during fiscal  we increased our annual dividends  which had been per share for fiscal to per share for fiscal the increase in annual dividends reflects the declaration and payment of our fiscal dividends at the increased rate of per share per quarter 
we intend to maintain our annual dividend of for fiscal stock repurchase program since the beginning of fiscal  the company has repurchased million shares for approximately billion 
during fiscal  we announced share repurchase authorizations totaling billion through august  during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately billion  including commissions  at an average price per share of 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares for billion  including commissions  at an average price per share of debt and credit facility the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the remaining balance of our percent notes payable of million  due september  was classified into current maturities of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the remaining balance of our percent note payable of million  due december notes is subject to an increasing or decreasing rate of interest based on certain credit rating fluctuations 
as a result of prior and current fiscal year changes to our long term credit ratings  the interest payable by us on the notes was percent per annum as of february  subsequent to year end  our credit rating was further downgraded which will increase the interest payable by us to percent per annum  effective on june  our access to the capital markets and interest expense on future financings is dependent on our senior unsecured debt rating 
however  we do not expect this downgrade to have a material impact on our financial statements 
on may   we entered into four separate million year letter of credit agreements and four separate million day letter of credit agreements for a total aggregate availability of million  which collectively replaced our prior letter of credit agreements 
unlike the previous letter of credit agreements  the current letter of credit agreements are unsecured 
consequently  the million of restricted cash that collateralized the prior letter of credit agreements was fully released in may as of may   the four million day letter of credit agreements expired and the total letter of credit capacity was reduced to million 
this reduction in the letter of credit capacity reflects our transition to open account payment terms as well as the available capacity under our million revolving credit facility to issue trade letters of credit 
on march   we called for the full redemption of our outstanding billion  percent senior convertible notes due march  the notes 
the redemption was complete by march  note holders had the option to receive cash at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest  for a total of approximately  per  principal amount of the notes 
alternatively  note holders could elect to convert their notes into approximately shares of the gap  inc common stock per  principal amount 
as of march   billion of principal was converted into million shares of the gap  inc common stock and approximately million was paid in cash redemption 

table of contents on august   we terminated all commitments under our million three year secured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in june the old facility and replaced the old facility with a new million five year unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in august the new facility 
the new facility is available for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper backstop  working capital  trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
the facility usage fees and fees related to the new facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio 
the new facility and letter of credit agreements contain financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the new facility and new letter of credit agreements  which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the new facility for letters of credit and advances  terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the new facility  and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements 
in addition  such a default could  under certain circumstance  permit the holders of our outstanding unsecured debt to accelerate payment of such obligations 
letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped 
vendor payables are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer  although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this 
as of february   we had million in trade letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreements totaling million and there were no borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
in line with our fiscal objective of reducing long term debt  we repaid million in debt in fiscal this included early extinguishment of million of our domestic debt and the maturity of million year euro bond million 
we repurchased and extinguished early an aggregate of million in principal amount of our notes due  million in principal amount of our notes due and million in principal amount of our notes due we performed a net present value analysis on our outstanding debt and determined that it would be beneficial to repurchase the debt early even though we incurred million in loss on early retirement of debt due to premiums paid and write off of debt issuance costs 
contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments we are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties

amounts reflected in consolidated balance sheets we have other long term liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  including deferred income taxes 
the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
therefore  the timing of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal that are included in current liabilities 
other cash obligations not reflected in consolidated balance sheets the majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores 
commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with international business machines corporation ibm entered in fiscal as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
under the services agreement  ibm will operate certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure that are currently operated by us 
the services agreement has an initial term of ten years  and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years 
we have various options to terminate the agreement  and we will pay ibm under a combination of fixed and variable charges  with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services 
based on the currently projected service needs  we expect to pay approximately billion to ibm over the remaining nine years of the contract 
the services agreement has performance levels that ibm must meet or exceed 
if these service levels are not met  we would in certain circumstances receive a credit against the charges otherwise due  have the right to other interim remedies  or as to material breaches have the right to terminate the services agreement 
in addition  the agreement provides us certain pricing protections  and we have the right to terminate the services agreement both for cause and for convenience subject  in the case of termination for convenience  to our payment of a termination fee 
ibm also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure 
we have applied the measurement and disclosure provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others  to our agreements that contain guarantee and certain indemnification clauses 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee 
as of february   we did not have any material guarantees that were issued or modified subsequent to december  
table of contents we are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties eg  ownership of assets  environmental or tax indemnifications or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
generally  the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and  as a result  the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability  we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of million  of which million has already been cash collateralized 
we are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool 
our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large  global corporation 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors 
merchandise inventory in fiscal  we implemented a new inventory system and effective january  the beginning of fiscal  we changed our inventory flow assumption from the first in  first out fifo method to the weighted average cost method wac 
the change in inventory accounting method did not have a material impact on the fiscal financial statements and because the effect on prior periods presented is not material  they have not been restated as would be required by sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost 
in addition  we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
the change in shortage expense as a percentage of cost of goods sold was a decrease of percentage points  an increase of percentage points and a decrease of percentage points for fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and excess facilities we have a significant investment in property and equipment 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
events that result in an impairment review include decisions to close a store  headquarter facility or distribution center  or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset 
for assets that are identified as potentially being impaired  if the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value of the asset is estimated using the discounted future cash flows of the assets based upon a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
our estimate of future cash flows is based upon our experience  knowledge and third party data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
we recorded a charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million  million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decision to close or sublease a store  distribution center or headquarter facility space can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised remaining useful life of the long lived asset 
in addition  we record a charge and corresponding sublease loss reserve for the net present value of the difference between the contract rent obligations and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties 
we estimate the reserve based on the status of our efforts to lease vacant office space and stores  including a review of real estate market conditions  our projections for sublease income and sublease commencement assumptions 
most store closures occur upon the lease expiration 
insurance and self insurance we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our employees 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts  and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for store sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register with either cash or credit card 
for online sales  we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product 
customers typically receive goods within a few days of shipment 
such amounts were immaterial as of february   january   and january  amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are reflected in net sales and the related costs are reflected in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses 
allowances for estimated returns are recorded based on estimated gross profit using our historical return patterns 

table of contents upon the purchase of a gift card or issuance of a gift certificate  a liability is established for the cash value of the gift card or gift certificate 
the liability is relieved and income is recorded as net sales upon redemption 
over time  some portion of the gift cards issued is not redeemed 
this amount is recorded as other income  which is a component of operating expenses 
beginning with the second quarter of  we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift cards to three years from our prior estimate of five years 
during the second quarter of  we completed an analysis of our historical gift card redemption patterns 
based on this analysis  we concluded that three years after the gift card is issued  we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote 
in the second quarter of fiscal  this change in estimate resulted in income recognition of approximately million before tax in other income 
share based compensation with the adoption of the statements of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment  sfas r at the beginning of our first fiscal quarter of  we added share based compensation as a critical accounting policy and estimate 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires assumptions requiring a high degree of judgment 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we proactively reviewed our stock option granting practices over the year period ended june  given the heightened scrutiny regarding this topic 
we concluded that the compensation expense recorded in our historical financial statements was materially correct 
specifically  we identified no backdating in connection with the grants of stock options to vice presidents and above 
we found some errors relating to the dating of stock option grants to certain lower level employees as well as some calculation errors 
we finalized our review and recorded million of additional compensation expense in the third quarter of fiscal related to historical stock option accounting 
income taxes we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any point in time  many tax years are subject to or in the process of audit by various taxing authorities 
to the extent that our estimates of probable settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
we also record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate in foreign countries  which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our risk management policy is to hedge substantially all forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations using foreign exchange forward contracts 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany loans and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding or issuing the intercompany loan or balance 
these contracts are entered into with large  reputable financial institutions  thereby minimizing the credit exposure from our counter parties 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  british pound  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management  we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of february  and january   based on a model that measures the change in fair values of our derivative financial instruments arising from a hypothetical percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers all foreign exchange derivative financial instruments offset by the underlying exposures 
the foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at february  and january  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an unfavorable impact on the fair values of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments  net of the underlying exposures  of million at february  and million at january  we hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries 
the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on the investments 
in addition  we used a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of million debt securities of our japanese subsidiary  gap japan kk  from a fixed interest rate of percent  payable in us dollars  to billion japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of percent 
these debt securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their issuance amount  net of unamortized discount 
the derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value as of february  we have limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
the interest on our long term debt is set at a fixed coupon  with the exception of the interest rates payable by us on our outstanding million notes due december  of which only million remains outstanding  which are subject to change based on our long term senior secured credit ratings 
the interest rates earned on our cash and equivalents will fluctuate in line with short term interest rates 
in march  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of percent senior convertible notes due march  the notes  and received proceeds of billion in cash  net of underwriting and other fees

the redemption was complete by march  note holders had the option to receive cash at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest  for a total of approximately  per  principal amount of the notes 
alternatively  note holders could elect to convert their notes into approximately shares of the gap  inc common stock per  principal amount 
as of march   billion of principal was converted into million shares of the gap  inc common stock and approximately million was paid in cash redemption 
in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of debt securities at an original annual interest rate of percent  due december  notes 
interest on the notes is payable 
table of contents semi annually  the note payable is subject to an increasing or decreasing rate of interest based on certain credit rating fluctuations 
we repurchased million of the notes during fiscal and million in fiscal as a result of prior and current fiscal year changes to our long term credit ratings  the interest payable by us on the notes was percent per annum as of february  subsequent to year end  our credit rating was further downgraded which will increase the interest payable by us to percent per annum  effective on june  our access to the capital markets and interest expense on future financings is dependent on our senior unsecured debt rating 
however  we do not expect this downgrade to have a material impact on our financial statements 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
