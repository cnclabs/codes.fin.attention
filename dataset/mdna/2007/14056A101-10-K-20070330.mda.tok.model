item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of december   we had total assets of approximately million  total net loans of approximately million  total deposits of approximately million and stockholders equity of approximately million 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or and per basic and diluted share  respectively  compared to net income of million  or and per basic and diluted share  respectively  for the comparative period in 
table of contents our primary source of revenue is net interest income 
our net interest income accounted for of gross revenue for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for and  respectively 
an analysis of net interest income is provided in the subheading entitled net interest income below 
our earnings performance is dependent on our ability to generate net interest income and the primary source of net interest income is interest income on loans 
the primary risks associated with our net interest income generation are credit risk and interest rate risk 
during the last three years  we have experienced an improving trend in credit quality as net charge offs have decreased and nonperforming assets have remained at a satisfactory level 
we manage credit risk through sound underwriting practices in connection with loan origination and ongoing review systems during the life of the loans 
these procedures are discussed in more detail in the loan origination section below 
short term interest rates  including the prime lending rate  increased during the first half of  but remained stable over the last half of the year 
in contrast  the cost of funding increased during the second half of as term liabilities matured and rolled into higher cost funds as well as the effect of competitive pricing pressure 
as a result  our net interest margin narrowed in the fourth quarter 
despite the year to year stability in net interest margin  the company expects that a challenging rate climate will continue  at least in the near term 
we manage interest rate risk with a monthly analysis of trends related to our net interest margin and the impact of changing interest rates 
we also model future performance expectations based on changing interest rates with a simulation model for asset liability management 
these procedures are discussed in more detail in the market risk and asset liability management sections below 
our strategy is to continue to increase our presence in our primary markets in the birmingham  huntsville and montgomery metropolitan markets in alabama and to expand our presence in the jacksonville  florida market 
we plan to place greater emphasis on acquisitions and expansion into new markets as these opportunities arise 
we also plan to continue utilizing our loan production office in atlanta  georgia through our business capital group to increase our noninterest income generated from gain on sale of loans 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry 
management makes a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during periods presented 
different assumptions in the application of these methods or policies could result in material changes in our financial statements 
as such  the following policies are considered critical accounting policies for us 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses from identified and otherwise inherent risks in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  we review the quality of  and risks in  loans in the portfolio 
we also consider such factors as specific known risks  our loan loss experience  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the status and amount of past due and nonperforming assets  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current and anticipated economic conditions  and other factors which management believes affect the allowance for loan losses 
an analysis of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is prepared by our credit administration department and presented to our subsidiary bank s board of directors on a monthly basis 
in addition  loan reviews are performed regularly on the quality of the loan portfolio and related adequacy of the allowance by an individual independent of the lending function 
we have outsourced loan review of loans in excess of million to an experienced loan review company which reviews these loans and provides reports approximately two times per year 
based on our analysis  which includes risk factors such as charge off rates  past dues and loan growth  we may determine that our future loan loss provision needs to increase or decrease in order for us to maintain the allowance at a level sufficient to absorb inherent credit losses 
if we become aware that any of these factors has materially changed  our estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance could also change 
all loans have a risk grade assigned at the time the loan is booked 
these risk grades are evaluated periodically for appropriateness based on the performance of the borrower and as new information is received on the borrower s financial condition 
the related allowance is calculated based on the risk grade assigned to the loan unless the loan is classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
once a loan is classified  an evaluation is made on a specific allowance to be assigned 
accordingly  changes in classification of a loan may change the amount of allowance allocated for that loan 
the allowance for loan losses is replenished through a provision for loan losses that is charged against our earnings 
as a result  variations in the allowance affect our earnings directly 
while it is our policy to charge off loans in the current period when a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
carrying value of securities securities designated as available for sale are carried at fair value 
however  the unrealized difference between amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale is excluded from net income and is reported  net of deferred taxes  as a component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost  as capitalsouth has the ability  and management has the positive intent  to hold these securities to maturity 
premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted according to the interest method 
treatment of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities as part of its overall interest rate risk management activities  capitalsouth utilizes derivative instruments i to modify the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities and ii to serve as an economic hedge of the fair value risk of fixed rate liabilities 
the primary instruments utilized by capitalsouth are interest rate swaps 
the fair values of these derivative financial instruments are based on dealer quotes and are recorded as an asset or liability and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation on july   the company early adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the company to recognize the costs of its employee stock option awards in its income statement 
according to sfas no 
r  the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to their grant date fair value and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards 
the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

r 
no compensation cost was recognized for share based payments granted prior to january   as all options were fully vested at january  compensation cost of  and  were recognized for share based payments granted during and  respectively 
treatment of deferred tax assets management s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon its judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets 
management believes that capitalsouth will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits

net income in was above the level as a result of our increased net interest income and the recognition of an after tax gain from the sale of our investment in consumer national bank in jackson  mississippi cnb in connection with the acquisition of cnb by another bank 
our overhead also increased in as a result of significant investments made in opening three new branch offices in as of december   we had banking offices  including our headquarters office  one loan production office and full time equivalent employees 
we expect to continue to expand our banking office network and our employee base in however  we are mindful of the fact that growth and increasing the number of offices add expenses such as administrative costs  occupancy  salaries and benefits expenses before earnings 
this is especially the case with respect to offices in new market areas

the net loan portfolio increased by million from year end to year end  compared with an increase of million from year end to year end we anticipate that our provision for loan losses will increase to provide an adequate allowance for loan losses related to the increased credit risk associated with growth in our loan portfolio 
we outsource a portion of our loan review function to an experienced loan review company whose primary function is to effectively monitor the quality of our loan portfolio  determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations  assess loan policies  validate the internal loan risk management system and provide enhancements to strengthen our credit culture 
the loan review company reviews all loans in excess of million  which loans average approximately of our loan portfolio  and conducts this loan review approximately two times per year

interest rate sensitivity financial institutions are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that their interest bearing liabilities consisting principally of customer deposits mature or reprice more or less frequently  or on a different basis  than their interest earning assets generally consisting of intermediate or long term loans and investment securities 
the match between the scheduled repricing and maturities of our earning assets and liabilities with defined time periods is referred to as gap analysis 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a negative or liability sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
this means we have more interest bearing liabilities expected to reprice within one year than interest earning assets 
the re pricing of our liabilities in today s rising rate environment is expected to put pressure on our margin  however  we continue to take measures to mitigate this impact 
we have grown our noninterest bearing sources of funds and have changed the mix of our interest bearing sources to lower cost sources 
the longer maturity earning assets are in our securities portfolio  the following table does not take into consideration the cash flows that occur due to payments on mortgage backed securities or any call features

the retention of existing deposits and attraction of new deposit sources through new and existing customers is critical to our liquidity position 
through our banking offices  we offer a variety of deposit products at competitive market interest rates 
ensuring competitive rates and terms generally assists in the retention of maturing time deposits and liquid deposits 
in the event of compression in liquidity due to a run off in deposits  we have a liquidity policy and procedure that provides for certain actions under varying liquidity conditions 
these actions include borrowing from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and existing correspondent banks  selling or participating loans  and the curtailment of loan commitments and funding 
at december   our liquid assets  represented by cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and available for sale securities  totaled million 
additionally  we had available to us a million unsecured line of credit with our primary correspondent bank and our subsidiary bank had additional borrowing availability at the federal home loan bank of atlanta of approximately million to meet short term funding needs 
we believe these sources of funding are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs 
management meets on a weekly basis to review sources and uses of funding to determine the appropriate strategy to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity  and we have increased our focus on the generation of core deposit funding to supplement our liquidity position 
at the current time  our long term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations and commitments and deposit withdrawals 
to finance our continued growth and planned expansion activities  we issued  shares of common stock in an initial public offering closed in december we issued an additional  shares pursuant to an 
table of contents over allotment option exercised by the underwriters in january the initial public offering provided immediate liquidity but primarily will provide us with the capital necessary to support an increase in our holdings of financial instruments  which will principally be funded through the growth of our deposit base 
our regular sources of funding are from the growth of our deposit base  repayment of principal and interest on loans  the sale of loans and the renewal of time deposits 
the proceeds from the initial public offering were applied to the repayment of million in capitalsouth debt  with million injected into the capital at capitalsouth bank to support continued growth of our lending activities and continued growth and expansion of our current markets

the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability committee of each of our subsidiary banks the asset liability committee

lastly  employers are required to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year that the changes occur with the changes reported in comprehensive income 
the standard is required to be adopted by entities having fiscal years ending after december  because the company does not have any defined benefit plans or other post retirement plans  this standard did not have an impact on the company s consolidated balance sheets or statements of income 
in september  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for purchases of life insurance determining the amount that could be realized in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for purchases of life insurance 
this issue addresses how an entity should determine the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date in applying ftb and if the determination should be on an individual or group policy basis 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material affect on the company s financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk is one of the most significant market risks affecting capitalsouth bank 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to changes in market interest rates that could adversely affect our net interest income or market value of equity 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors of our subsidiary bank  and carried out by the asset liability committee 
the committee s objectives are to manage exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon while  at the same time  ensuring a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for the repricing characteristics of new business flow  pricing of deposit products  and investment security purchase and sale strategies 

table of contents our primary measurement of interest rate risk consists of projections of earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized modeling 
the modeling assumes a static balance sheet  and incorporates the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our subsidiary bank s existing assets and liabilities  including off balance sheet financial instruments 
net interest income is first computed under the model assuming no change in market interest rates 
these results are then compared to the results of other interest rate scenarios where interest rates are moved shocked up and down and basis points bp 
time horizons of months  year  years  and years are analyzed 
the impact of embedded options in products such as callable and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans and callable borrowings are considered 
we compare the changes in net interest income in the shock up and shock down scenarios to the net interest income in an unchanged rate scenario 
the asset liability committee utilizes the results of this modeling shock modeling to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
the results of the december  shock modeling suggested no exposure in the level of net interest income to changes in interest rates for the next month period 
the bank s market value of equity is exposed to increases in interest rates for the next month period 
however  the amount of the exposure is within the bank s policy limits 
the static shock model scenarios considered changes of and basis points during a month period 
the model assumes in the decreasing rate scenarios the existence of hypothetical floors on now account deposits  savings deposits and money market deposits 
these floors limit the cost reductions for these deposits in a decreasing interest rate environment given the current historically low levels of market interest rates 
the model also takes into consideration changing prepayment speeds for the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios in the varying interest rate environments 
interest rate risk income sensitivity summary as of december  down bp down bp current up bp up bp dollar amounts in thousands net interest income change net interest income change net interest income computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit run offs and pricing and reinvestment strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
these commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments 
we follow the same credit policies in making these commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our maximum exposure to credit risk for unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit at december    and is presented in the following table 
as of december  dollar amounts in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit 
table of contents commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral  if any  we obtain on an extension of credit is based on our credit evaluation of the customer
