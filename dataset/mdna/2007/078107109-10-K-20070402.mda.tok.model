the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the summary of accounting policies within the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of each of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition on product sales is not subject to significant estimates as the company has not experienced significant product returns 
the company s revenue recognition practices are not considered to involve complex estimates and judgments 
revenue is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  primarily product sales that include deployment services 
the delivered items are accounted for separately  provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if we make different judgments about these arrangements  material differences in the amount of recognized product sales and services revenues could result 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 the company records revenue either based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained 
the company records revenue on a gross basis when it acts as a principal in the transaction  is the primary obligor in the arrangement  establishes prices  determines the supplier  and has credit risk 
the company records revenue on a net basis when the supplier is the primary obligor in the arrangement  when the amount earned is a percentage of the total transaction value and is usually received directly from the supplier  and when the supplier has credit risk 
product sales to most customers are recorded on a gross basis as the company is responsible for fulfilling the order  establishes the selling price to the customer  has the responsibility to pay suppliers for all products ordered  regardless of when  or if  it collects from the customer  and determines the credit worthiness of its customers 
arrangements with each customer are evaluated to determine if gross or net recording is appropriate 
if we make different judgments about these arrangements  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized could result
