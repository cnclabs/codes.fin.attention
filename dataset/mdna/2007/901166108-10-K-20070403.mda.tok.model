and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
executive overview record sales and earnings we were very pleased with our results for fiscal  which drove record sales and earnings 
we finished the year with million in net sales  nearly higher than fiscal net sales of million 
this led to a increase in net income and a increase in earnings per diluted share  to  our highest earnings per diluted share ever reported 
our strong performance was due to an outstanding year for our justice division and continued strong operating results from limited too 
we ended the year with million in cash and short term investments after investing million in new stores and other capital projects and returning million to shareholders through our continued share repurchase program 
limited too still going strong limited too has always provided tween girls with the latest fashion apparel and accessories for all aspects of her ever changing life  and fiscal was no exception 
on the apparel side  our camis and cut and sew casual tops performed exceptionally well this year  posting double digit average store sales increases  mainly due to our longer  leaner knit tops in all her favorite colors 
our shorts and legwear departments also had a remarkable year due to the popularity of the longer bermuda short and leggings  which can be worn under skirts  dresses  and long shirts 
less successful categories for fiscal included casual shirts  skirts and accessories 
however  our ready to wear dresses and underwear performed quite well 
in our accessories business  better performing categories included girlcare products and footwear  mainly due to our swimwear accessories featuring assorted colored flip flops to complete any outfit 
lifestyle items  primarily electronic devices  games and bedroom furnishings also had a great year due to our girl s increased interest in technology  which has her shopping for hand held electronic games  prepaid cell phones and digital makeover systems  in addition to the latest fashions 
electronics were popular in fiscal we formed relationships with several new partners to help fill our shelves with the latest toys and games our technology driven tweens crave

limited too continues to foster relationships with its customers through a variety of media 
in fiscal  we published catazine catalog and magazine combination editions  three more than were published in fiscal  increasing total circulation to million books  a increase over fiscal we believe our catazines remain our best advertising and promotional vehicles and the most effective way to communicate with our girls 
we discontinued our television advertising campaigns in fiscal but we began using e mail reminders as a way of alerting girls about sales  as well as distributing coupons for use in store and online 
we continued our voicemail reminders  and birthday and report card promotions that have proven effective in the past 
for fiscal  limited too plans to increase catazine circulation to nearly million 
we grew our direct business significantly in  proof that our girl and her mom are becoming increasingly comfortable with our e commerce site and the convenience it offers 
total catazine and web sales grew over 
table of contents fiscal and delivered over million in incremental operating income  almost triple the results of we took significant steps during the year to put the right team in place to take our direct business to the next level

we expect fiscal to be an exciting year for limited too 
with to net store additions  plans for to store remodels and anticipated circulation of nearly million catazines  we are expecting strong performance and continued growth 
our early reads on our spring fashion have been encouraging and we believe we are positioned to provide our girl with everything she needs and wants for her constantly evolving lifestyle 
justice moving right along in fiscal  justice continued its solid growth by adding stores to its portfolio  making it one of the fastest growing concepts in specialty retailing 
justice enjoyed a comparable store sales increase of  following an increase of for fiscal this increase was due to having the right fashion in our stores for our tween customers and their moms 
from a merchandising standpoint  our established sportswear business continued to grow and post strong positive comparable sales increases 
similar to limited too  casual shirts and skirts had a disappointing year  however  our accessories continued to perform well along with our lifestyle items  footwear and party related items 
justice s ability to continuously meet or exceed expectations validates we have established the appropriate groundwork for a successful and long lasting brand 
fiscal also brought the nationwide launch of justice shine parties  providing our girl with a new and unique experience to celebrate her birthday or other special day with her closest friends 
by choosing one of four party themes pretty princess  rock idol  hula girl  or movie star  our girls and their friends can spend part of the day at justice and celebrate their way 
girls receive party themed goodie bags including a future discount offer at justice stores 
we hosted close to  parties this year and made justice stores the birthday place to be for tens of thousands of tween girls 
in  we enhanced our marketing efforts at justice by launching our very first catazine for back to school 
we delivered our second and third editions during early fall and holiday seasons which proved very positive for the brand 
in home communication with our customers increased during the year with the launch of birthday mailings as well as several other direct mail offerings 
these mailings arrive complete with a coupon or sale reminder alerting our girls about in store sales and promotions on her favorite styles 
we continued our justice fun card program  which rewards our girls for shopping with us at certain times of the year spring  back to school and holiday and encourages them to return to use a discount during a specified redemption period 
the future continues to look bright for justice 
for fiscal  we are planning approximately new store openings  a pace of growth we plan to maintain for the next to years 
plans call for eight catazines  five more than last year 
we expect to introduce new merchandise categories  such as intimate apparel  which we believe will generate excitement and incremental sales in our stores 
we intend to enhance the justice website presence  becoming e commerce capable in we believe we can build on the momentum created by our fashionable merchandise  fun store environment  and justice shine parties to introduce more and more tween girls and their moms to our great off mall brand that is just for girls

in fiscal  we developed a data warehouse  enabling us to better monitor our business and make more informed decisions 
we are currently upgrading the merchandise planning and allocation systems and are developing new enterprise resource planning programs to replace dated financial systems 
we believe the investments we are making in information technology

stock repurchase in fiscal  we repurchased over million shares of common stock for million under authorization granted by the board of directors

for the period february  through the date of this filing  we have repurchased million shares for million 
capital investment and resources our capital spending plans for fiscal are forecasted to be between and million  or to more than was invested last year 
we intend to spend to million on opening new stores and remodeling older limited too locations 
of the remainder  we estimate million will go toward our home office expansion and million will be invested in our information technology and other supply chain initiatives 
as in fiscal  we expect cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will fund substantially all of our capital expenditures 
home office expansion we are planning an addition to our new albany  ohio headquarters to accommodate our expected growth 
plans call for the late completion of a  square foot building connected to our existing home office 
this will serve as the new headquarters for our justice division

international expansion our relationship with alshaya trading co 
wll continues and they currently have licensed limited too stores successfully operating in upscale malls in the kingdom of saudi arabia  kuwait  united arab emirates  and qatar

while we are pleased with our middle eastern operations  we continue to seek out other appropriate international markets where we feel one or both of our brands would be successful 
being tween we understand it takes integrity  dedication and a commitment to excellence to form the foundation that will drive the success of our future plans

table of contents our twentieth anniversary this year marks our th anniversary 
the first limited too store opened in as a department within limited brands the limited stores 
at various times during our initial years of operations we sold apparel for young girls  toddlers and infants  eventually emerging as a stand alone division of limited brands 
since then  we have redefined our company to focus exclusively on tweens to become their destination of choice for all the coolest fashion and accessories 
in just years  we have grown into a multi million dollar enterprise operating two national brands and stores across the united states and licensing the operation of international stores

table of contents for fiscal  both aur and upt increased  which led to a increase in ads over fiscal although the above table shows transactions per store up slightly in fiscal from fiscal  when adjusted for the rd week  transactions per store remained nearly the same 
transactions over  a statistic we watch very carefully due to our marketing program thresholds  now comprise over of all sales dollars and almost of all transactions at our stores 
for fiscal  our transactions per store decreased from fiscal  however  our ads and aur both increased significantly  indicating our customers may have made fewer trips to our stores 
the quality of their transactions appear to have improved as evidenced by the considerable increase in our transactions over  as a percentage of total transactions 
gross income fiscal gross income for fiscal was million or of net sales  an increase of million over fiscal due to increased markdowns in the fall season  however  gross income decreased basis points as a percentage of net sales bps from while our gross income excluding buying and occupancy costs internal gross income improved million  it decreased bps over fiscal the decrease was driven primarily by two factors a decreased merchandise margin in our limited too brand driven by the previously mentioned fall season markdowns as well as a merchandise shift towards electronics and lifestyle items  and the relative growth of our justice brand  which currently has a lower internal gross income rate than limited too 
buying and occupancy costs increased million over fiscal  driven primarily by increased store occupancy costs related to new store growth and higher catazine costs 
we leveraged these increased expenses  however  driving a bps improvement from fiscal fiscal gross income for fiscal reached million or of net sales  an increase of million or bps over fiscal our gross income excluding buying and occupancy costs improved million and bps due primarily to reduced markdowns  driven by improved merchandise in our stores and tighter inventory management 
although buying and occupancy expenses increased million  it improved bps from fiscal due to leveraged store occupancy expenses at our limited too stores  leveraged buying payroll costs for both brands and reduced catazine production costs in limited too

changes in dollar change change in bps store operating expenses home office marketing distribution center other total change store operating expenses increased nearly in dollars in fiscal over fiscal  but remained unchanged as a percentage of sales  driven by the net addition of new stores and additional associate hours required by our higher sales volume 
home office expenses increased due to higher payroll costs to support our information technology and store growth  hardware  software and consulting expenses related to our multi year information technology initiative  and higher expenses related to our stock based compensation programs  resulting from the 
table of contents expensing of stock options as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
marketing expenses decreased due to the discontinuation of television advertising  used in fiscal during the spring and back to school seasons  partially offset by the cost of new marketing programs for our justice brand

vs 
changes in dollar change change in bps home office store operating expenses marketing distribution center other total change home office expenses increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation and restricted stock expense  as well as additional payroll and consulting expenses related to our multi year information technology initiative 
while total store operating expenses increased on a dollar basis from the prior year  we leveraged those increased expenses  and delivered a increase in sales  resulting in a bps decrease 
the dollar increase in store operating expenses was primarily driven by the addition of new justice stores in fiscal marketing expenses increased due to additional television advertising campaigns aired during the spring selling season 
in  we aired three television campaigns and employed outbound calls to our customers as a direct marketing tool  only one television campaign was aired in fiscal total fiscal distribution center  direct shipping and other selling expenses were decreased from the prior year driving a bps reduction  despite servicing more stores on average 
interest income  net fiscal interest income is earned on investments in money market securities and short term  highly liquid  tax free and insured municipal bonds 
interest income  net  amounted to million for fiscal versus million for the increase in was primarily attributed to favorable interest rates and lower credit facility and letter of credit fees 
fiscal interest income  net  amounted to million for fiscal versus million for the increase in was primarily attributed to higher investment balances and favorable interest rates 
provision for income taxes fiscal the total provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million for our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in the slight rate decrease was primarily attributable to increased investment income from short term  tax free municipal bonds and the favorable settlement of certain state tax examinations 

table of contents we do not expect any significant change in our statutory tax rate in fiscal our effective rate will continue to be impacted by items such as municipal interest income  overseas operations and the settlement of any tax examinations which may occur in the future 
fiscal the total provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million for the effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in the rate decrease was primarily attributable to increased investment income from tax free municipal bonds and the favorable settlement of certain state tax examinations 
our outlook for the future over the next few years we intend to open between and justice stores per year and add a small number of limited too stores each year  in situations that meet our internal return requirements 
justice stores will open primarily in power strip centers  while limited too stores may open in lifestyle centers or street locations  in addition to traditional malls 
looking to our margins  we expect our annual consolidated gross income rate to improve slightly as we continue to leverage our design and occupancy costs 
ultimately  we feel the justice gross income rate will approach the limited too rate 
despite this expected improvement  however  over the next few years  the gross income rate for justice is forecasted to remain below that of limited too 
the limited too gross income rate should remain flat as improvements in our apparel margins are offset by the growth of electronics  which traditionally have lower margins 
limited too margins may also be negatively impacted by increases in mall rents as we renew leases and open new stores 
gross income rates in any given period can be impacted by factors such as inventory levels  fashion hits and misses and merchandise mix 
moving on to expenses  we expect to incur incremental store operating  general and administrative sg a expenses in related to our information technology initiative and increased corporate payroll 
our store operating expenses will more than likely remain flat as a percentage of sales as minimum wage increases in numerous states are expected to increase our hourly rate  and offset any productivity improvements we achieve 
overall  we feel our sg a rate as a percent of net sales will de leverage slightly in  and then improve slightly as rate to net sales beginning in we do not expect any significant change in our statutory tax rate in fiscal our effective rate will continue to be impacted by items such as municipal interest income  overseas operations and the settlement of any tax examinations  which may occur in the future 
we believe tween brands is well positioned for future growth 
our latest brand  justice  has proven it can be a major retail contender and profit contributor and will serve as our primary growth vehicle for the foreseeable future 
our established brand  limited too  continues to seize opportunities for increased profitability and will continue to be the place in the mall for tween girls and their moms to get the hottest fashions 
for both brands  we are continually designing creative marketing initiatives to communicate our brand message to new customers and remind regular customers why limited too and justice are their favorite tween stores 
by anticipating and delivering the leading fashion our customers have come to expect  we intend to expand our market share  grow shareholder value and remain the tween expert 
analysis of financial condition and liquidity financial condition our balance sheet continues to strengthen primarily due to our positive cash flows from operations 
we were able to finance all capital expenditures  as well as our stock repurchases  with existing working capital  combined with cash generated from operations  and ended the year with million in cash and short term investments 
in assessing 
table of contents the financial condition of the business  we consider factors such as cash flow from operations and internally funded capital expenditures to be key indicators of financial health 
a more detailed discussion of liquidity  capital resources and expected future capital expenditures follows 
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains enough liquidity to support the operations of the business and withstand unanticipated business volatility 
we believe cash flow from operations  together with current levels of cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to support ongoing operations  fund capital expenditures related to projected business growth and technology investments  opportunistically repurchase shares and finance seasonal build up of inventories 
in  we continued our share repurchase program  as an effective method of returning value to shareholders 
after using approximately million of cash to repurchase common stock as well as funding million in capital expenditures  our working capital defined as current assets less restricted assets and current liabilities continues to remain strong at million at year end  down slightly from year end we intend to continue our share repurchases  as conditions allow under our current board authorization to repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock 
we also plan to continue funding capital expenditures for store expansion  home office expansion  store remodeling and our information technology modernization plan 
although we expect continued improvement in our overall liquidity  we recognize the specialty retail industry can be highly volatile  where fashion missteps can quickly impact the ability to generate operating cash 
the table below summarizes our working capital position and capitalization in thousands fy fy fy working capital capitalization long term debt shareholders equity total capitalization amounts available under the credit facility restricted assets although our working capital has decreased  we continue to operate debt free and remain well above the industry average in our liquidity ratios as shown below tween brands  inc apparel february  january  industry s p current ratio debt equity ratio tween brands  inc is currently debt free information reflects the latest apparel stores industry financial ratios found on msn money our liquidity is further enhanced by our unsecured million credit facility

inventory levels at year end were higher than year end levels or per square foot from year end 
however  when inventory is evaluated on a comparable time frame  that is weeks ago  it increased per square foot from this was composed of a increase at justice  and an increase at limited too 
the remainder of the increase was due primarily to a higher amount of inventory from our direct sourcing operation  which we take ownership for a given in store date three to four weeks earlier than outsourced inventory 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses as compared to fiscal was primarily related to lower payables outstanding at year end due to shorter payment terms in fiscal and increased marketing expense  partially offset by higher accrued payroll expense 
our received tenant allowances grew slightly over driven by the continued growth of our justice brand

the increase in the use of cash for income taxes for fiscal was due primarily to an income tax receivable settled in and higher pre tax income in fiscal this was partially offset by the increased tax benefit received on increased stock option activity in versus inventory levels at year end increased over year end levels 
this was due primarily to a increase in average store count resulting from the growth of our justice brand 
improved buying strategies and the negotiation of favorable vendor payment terms allowed us to use less cash in compared to to purchase slightly more inventory 
overall  at year end  inventory on a per store basis decreased slightly from additional tenant allowances were received during the current year based on increases in store count in our justice brand 
the increase in cash generated by accounts payable and accrued expenses over fiscal was primarily related to the timing of receipts and the increase in accrued compensation cost related to restricted stock 
the remaining increase in operating cash is due primarily to the increase in our deferred compensation liability

capital expenditures increased due to increased store construction related to our justice brand  the purchase of a acre parcel of land adjacent to our current corporate offices and technology related capital spending 
non qualified benefit plan funding was the primary driver for the remaining use of investing cash 
we expect future funding levels of our nonqualified benefit plans to be slightly less than  but will be above the amounts in and

future capital expenditures we anticipate spending between million and million in fiscal for capital expenditures 
this will be primarily for new stores  remodeling or expansion of existing stores  continuing our information technology initiative and the addition of a new headquarters for our justice division 
we intend to add  to  square feet to our store base in  primarily through the growth of justice  representing a to increase over year end we estimate the average cost for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures for limited too stores to be opened in will be between  and  per store  before any tenant allowances we may receive 
average pre opening costs per store  which are expensed as incurred  are expected to be approximately  while inventory purchases are expected to average approximately  per store 
we anticipate remodeling between and limited too stores in fiscal  the cost of which is comparable to that of opening a new store 
we plan to open approximately new justice stores in fiscal  and anticipate the cost for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures for each of these stores to be between  and  before any tenant allowances we may receive 
pre opening costs for justice are similar to those of limited too 
however  inventory purchases for justice are expected to be slightly lower than those for limited too  averaging approximately  per store 
we continue to execute an extensive multi year information technology modernization program to ensure our information technology infrastructure can fully support our expected growth 
in we created a data warehouse that gives key decision makers more timely information to both monitor the business and make sound business decisions 
we also updated our core planning and allocation capabilities with a new suite of fully integrated financial planning  assortment planning  forecasting and open to buy tools 
in  we intend to implement a new enterprise resource planning suite to replace the current financial  merchandising and real estate planning suites 
total costs for this phase of our multi year information technology initiative are anticipated to range between and million and should be completed by these costs and the related project timing are estimates  and therefore are subject to variation 
we expect cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operating activities will fund substantially all currently anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
transitional services and separation agreements in connection with the august spin off  we entered into several transitional services and separation agreements the transitional services agreements with limited brands regarding certain aspects of our ongoing relationship 
we believe that the terms of these agreements are similar to terms achievable through arm s length negotiations with third parties 
trademark and service mark licensing agreement at the time of the spin off  we entered into an exclusive trademark and service mark licensing agreement the trademark agreement with limited brands that allows us to operate under the limited too brand name 
the trademark agreement had an initial term of five years after the spin off  renewable annually at our option 
all licenses granted under the trademark agreement will be granted free of charge 
in return  we are required to provide limited brands with the right to inspect our stores and distribution facilities and an ability to review and approve our advertising 
under the trademark agreement  we are only able to use the brand name limited too in connection with any business in which we sell to our current target customer group or to infants and toddlers 
in addition  we may not use the limited too brand name or its derivative on merchandise that competes with merchandise currently 
table of contents offered by limited brands or its subsidiaries  unless it is for our current target customer group 
limited brands has the right to terminate the trademark agreement under certain limited conditions 
store leases agreement at february   of our stores were adjacent to limited brands stores 
in addition  many of these aforementioned stores are part of stores that are subject to sublease agreements the store leases agreement with limited brands or a former affiliate of limited brands for stores where we occupy space that limited brands or a former affiliate of limited brands leases from third party landlords the direct limited leases 
under the terms of the store leases agreement  we are responsible for our proportionate share  based on the size of our selling space  of all costs principally rent  excess rent  if applicable  maintenance and utilities 
all termination rights and other remedies under the direct limited leases remain with limited brands 
if limited brands decides to terminate any of the direct limited leases early  limited brands must first offer to assign such lease to us 
if  as a result of such early termination by limited brands  we are forced to remodel our store or relocate within the mall  limited brands will compensate us with a combination of cash payments and loans 
although a loan option is available under the store leases agreement  we have not used this option for the financing of expenses associated with early terminations 
since the end of  limited brands has compensated us  relating to early terminations for stores 
the table below outlines the general guidelines for the compensation and loan structure with limited brands 
minimum optional cash loan remaining lease term payment amount less than one year one to two years three to four years greater than four years of the direct limited leases  are scheduled to expire during or later 
we may not assign or sublet our interest in those premises  except to an affiliate  without limited brands consent 
if limited brands intends to sublet or assign its portion of the leased premises under any of the direct limited leases to any non affiliate  it will be required to give us days notice  and we will be allowed to terminate our interest on that basis 
of the direct limited leases  are guaranteed by limited brands 
pursuant to the store leases agreement  we are required to make additional payments to limited brands as consideration for the guarantees that limited brands provides under such leases along with amounts for adjacent stores based on those locations achieving certain performance targets 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements  such as variable interests in unconsolidated entities  as of february  
table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments may have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources

refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been minor 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  long lived assets and sales returns 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following estimates and assumptions are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition store sales  net of sales tax  are recorded when the customer takes possession of merchandise 
sales discounts associated with our too bucks  bonus card and fun card programs are recognized upon redemption in conjunction with a qualifying purchase 
direct sales  through our catazines and website  are recorded upon shipment of merchandise to the customer  which approximates the amount of revenue that would be recognized if sales were recorded upon receipt by the customer 
a reserve is provided for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 

table of contents operating leases rent expense for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rents over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial lease term includes the build out period of our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is accrued in the consolidated balance sheets 
tenant allowances tenant allowances received from landlords  typically in the form of one time cash payments or reduced rent charges for a specific length of time  are treated as lease incentives and are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the initial lease term  including the build out period  and any renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the unearned portion of tenant allowances from landlords is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash equivalents short term investments with original maturities of three months or less are generally classified as cash equivalents 
we also consider credit card receivables to be cash equivalents due to our policy of liquidating those balances daily  so that ordinarily we do not have more than days of outstanding collections 
we maintain cash deposits in banks that  from time to time  exceed the amount of deposit insurance available 
we periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions and believe any potential loss is minimal 
outstanding checks classified in accounts payable and in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets totaled million and million as of february  and january   respectively 
investments investments in debt and auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and reported at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every to days 
we classify these securities as current assets despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities because we have the ability to quickly liquidate them to support current operations 
certain securities with long term contractual maturities are classified as held to maturity and are accounted for at amortized cost with any premium or discount amortized over the holding period 
we have classified these securities as held to maturity based on our intent and ability to hold them to maturity as determined at the time of purchase 
investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and adverse developments in that credit risk could restrict our ability to liquidate securities at their maturity or earlier 
inventories inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a weighted average cost basis  using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the use of the retail method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value and cost of inventories 
we record a charge to cost of goods sold for all inventory on hand when a permanent retail price reduction is reflected 
at the end of each selling season  we reduce the cost of our inventory to the estimated value of the inventory when it is ultimately removed from the stores  less the expected proceeds from the sale of the inventory to sell off vendors 
inherent in the retail method are certain management judgments and estimates including  among others  future sales  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to sell through merchandise 
we estimate and accrue our inventory shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis  using service lives for store assets ranging principally from the shorter of the lease term or years for leasehold improvements and to years for other property and equipment 
depreciation for fixed assets at our home office and distribution center are calculated using service lives of years for buildings  to years for furniture and fixtures and to years for computers and other office equipment 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
interest costs associated with the construction of certain long term projects are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized 
assets are reviewed on an annual basis for impairment  and based on our judgment  are written down to the estimated fair value based on anticipated future cash flows 
in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize certain costs associated with internally developed or modified software and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  usually to years 
these costs include  but are not limited to  employee payroll costs for time devoted to developing the projects as well as external direct costs for materials and services 
these costs are expensed until the software project reaches the development stage 
subsequent additions or upgrades to existing software are capitalized only to the extent that they add value and additional performance functionality 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
the capitalization of software requires our judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax laws and published guidance with respect to applicability to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because we believe it is reasonably certain that the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
provision is made for federal income taxes  which may be payable on foreign subsidiary earnings to the extent that we anticipate these earnings will be repatriated

seasonality historically  our operations and results have been seasonally skewed  with a significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season and  to a lesser extent  the third quarter  reflecting increased demand during the back to school selling season 
during fiscal  the third and fourth fiscal quarters accounted for approximately of our sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any negative factors affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments and relocations  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions
