item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range of early stage and late stage product development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services comprise two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes early development services  which includes preclinical and clinical pharmacology service offerings  and late stage development services  which includes central laboratory  clinical development  cardiac safety services  periapproval and market access services 
although each segment has separate services within it  they can be combined in joint service offerings and we believe clients increasingly are interested in opportunities for such combined services 
covance believes it is one of the largest drug development services companies  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that is capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to provide data to clients as rapidly as possible and reduce product development time 
we believe this enables covance s customers to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and as a result  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  covance s comprehensive services and broad experience provide its customers with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
critical accounting policies covance s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered  depending upon the nature of the work contracted 
historically  a majority of covance s net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years  but can extend in duration up to five years or longer 
service contracts generally take the form of fee for service or fixed price arrangements 
in the case of fee for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  based upon  for example  hours worked or samples tested 
for long term fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  with performance generally assessed using output measures  such as units of work performed to date as compared to the total units of work contracted 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms 
renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured 
estimates of costs to complete are made to provide  where appropriate  for losses expected on contracts 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
in some cases  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed or products are delivered  as discussed above 
additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance based milestones over the contract duration 
most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice 
these contracts typically require payment to covance of expenses to wind down the study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by covance under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured 
bad debts 
covance endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business 
covance maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected 
this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management s judgment  actual bad debt write offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded 
historically bad debt write offs have not been material 
taxes 
since covance conducts operations on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance s profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions in which covance operates 
in addition  covance maintains a tax reserve for uncertain tax positions  changes in which also impact covance s effective tax rate in the period in which such changes are made 
the balance of this tax reserve  which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  at december  is million  and relates to exposures for tax matters such as transfer pricing  nexus  deemed dividends  vat and the allocation of overhead costs across various federal  state and foreign income tax jurisdictions 
by way of background  an accrual is established at the time an exposure is identified when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of the accrual for each item for which an exposure exists is adjusted when either a matters are settled at amounts which are different than the amount included in the reserve or b when facts indicate a significant change in either the probability or estimated amount of the potential exposure 
while covance believes that it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures will be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that changes in estimates in the future could cause covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve 
significant activity relating to the reserve for uncertain tax positions which occurred during included a million reduction in the reserve during the third quarter of as a result of a favorable settlement with a foreign tax authority relating to research and development tax credits totaling million  as well as exposures as to which it is no longer probable that a liability exists relating primarily to transfer pricing matters aggregating million 
partially offsetting this reduction was an increase in the reserve balance during the fourth quarter of totaling million relating to various state and foreign tax exposures arising in the fourth quarter of as well as the accrual of additional interest on matters still outstanding 
the effect of the fourth quarter increase in the reserve balance on the effective tax rate was offset by a reduction in income taxes payable in the fourth quarter of approximately million resulting from tax return to financial statement accrual adjustments made to reflect actual amounts due upon filing of tax returns in the fourth quarter 
see recently issued accounting standards on page covance s policy is to provide income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries only to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted 
covance s historical policy has been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the united states 
except for the amounts repatriated in the fourth quarter of under the american jobs creation act of the act  covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the united states 
as a result  taxes have not been provided on any accumulated foreign unremitted earnings as of december  stock based compensation 
the company sponsors several stock based compensation plans pursuant to which non qualified stock options and restricted stock awards are granted to eligible employees 
through the year ended december   the company followed the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  and  accordingly  accounted for awards under these plans pursuant to the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas under apb  compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements relating to awards of stock 
however  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for stock option grants  as all options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
additionally  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for shares purchased by employees under the company s employee stock purchase plan pursuant to which employees are able to purchase shares of the company s common stock at a price equal to of the lower of the market value on the first or last day of each calendar quarter as that plan was considered to be non compensatory under apb effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r revises sfas  supersedes apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
under that transition method  compensation expense is now recognized in the financial statements on a go forward basis for a all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the grant date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company used stock options as the vehicle through which stock based compensation awards were granted to eligible employees  other than executive officers who historically were granted a combination of performance based share awards and stock options 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  the company is now using a mix of restricted share awards and stock options as the vehicles through which stock based compensation awards are granted to eligible employees  other than executive officers who continue to receive a combination of performance based share awards and stock options 
the grant date fair value of stock awards is based upon the underlying price of the stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of stock option awards must be determined using an option pricing model 
option pricing models require the use of estimates and assumptions as to a the expected term of the option  b the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock  c the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option and d pre vesting forfeiture rates 
for stock options granted prior to january   the company used the black scholes merton option pricing formula for determining the grant date fair value of such awards 
for stock options granted on or subsequent to january   the company is using the lattice binomial option pricing formula for determining the grant date fair value of stock option awards 
the company changed to the lattice binomial option pricing formula as it believes such formula may result in a better estimate of fair value than the black scholes merton formula 
the expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term and expected employee exercise and expected post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock is based upon the historical volatility of the company s stock computed over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based upon the implied yields currently available from the us treasury zero coupon yield curve for issues with a remaining duration equal to the expected term of the option 
pre vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based upon past voluntary termination behavior and past option forfeitures 
the following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted for the years ended december   and expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate s expected life of options years changes in any of these assumptions could impact  potentially materially  the amount of expense recorded in future periods related to stock based awards 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options granted was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested performance based shares and restricted stock awards was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
impairment of assets 
covance reviews its long lived assets other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon covance s judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
covance performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter 
this test is performed by comparing  at the reporting unit level  the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
covance assesses fair value based upon its estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to be generated by the reporting unit 
the test performed for did not identify any instances of impairment 
however  changes in expectations as to the present value of a reporting unit s future cash flows might impact subsequent years assessments of impairment 
defined benefit pension plans 
covance sponsors defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at three foreign subsidiaries as well as a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan and a post employment retiree health and welfare plan for the benefit of eligible employees at certain us subsidiaries 
the measurement of the related benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost recorded each year is based upon actuarial computations which require the use of judgment as to certain assumptions 
the more significant of these assumptions are a the appropriate discount rate to use in computing the present value of the benefit obligation  b the expected return on plan assets for funded plans  and c the expected future rate of salary increases for pay related plans 
actual results such as the return on plan assets  future rate of salary increases and plan participation rates will likely differ from the assumptions used 
those differences  along with changes that may be made in the assumptions used from period to period  will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnote disclosures 
set forth below is a discussion of the impact that a differences between assumed results and actual results and b assumption changes have had on our results of operations for the years ended december   and and on the financial position of the plans as of december  and for our uk defined benefit pension plans the largest of our defined benefit type pension plans 
united kingdom plans amounts in millions net periodic pension cost weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost discount rate expected rate of return on assets salary increases the increase decrease in the net periodic benefit cost from period to period is attributable to the following united kingdom plans amounts in millions to to to change in discount rate change in expected rate of return on assets change in rate of salary increases other  including differences between actual experience and assumptions used foreign currency exchange rate changes net change in periodic benefit cost united kingdom plans weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation discount rate salary increases the change in the projected benefit obligation from period to period is attributable to the following united kingdom plans amounts in millions to to projected benefit obligation  beginning of year service interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost in year benefits paid increase reduction in discount rate other  including differences between actual experience and assumptions used foreign currency exchange rate changes projected benefit obligation  end of year foreign currency risks since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts covance executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular covance subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance s subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs when revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance s consolidated financial results 
see risk factors 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in covance s consolidated statements of income 
finally  covance s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet includes the cumulative translation account balance of million 
operating expenses and reimbursable out of pockets covance segregates its recurring operating expenses among four categories cost of revenue  reimbursed out of pocket expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefits  other direct costs  shipping and handling fees  and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  tends and is expected to fluctuate from one period to another  as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  advertising and promotional expenses  administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators  volunteers and other out of pocket costs such as for travel  printing  meetings  couriers  etc  for which it is reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profit 
investigator fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor  passing through these costs without risk or reward to covance 
all other out of pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses 
results of operations items affecting comparability between periods prior to  the company followed the disclosure only provisions of sfas  and  accordingly  accounted for awards under these plans pursuant to the recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas under apb  compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements relating to awards of stock 
however  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for stock option grants  as all options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
additionally  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for shares purchased by employees under the company s employee stock purchase plan pursuant to which employees are able to purchase shares of the company s common stock at a price equal to of the lower of the market value on the first or last day of each calendar quarter as that plan was considered to be non compensatory under apb covance reflected the expense associated with the fair value of stock based awards in its required pro forma footnote disclosure under sfas in its sec filings 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r revises sfas  supersedes apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
under that transition method  compensation expense is now recognized in the financial statements on a prospective basis for a all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the grant date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
management believes that it may be useful for investors  in evaluating current period financial performance  to compare to results that include stock based compensation computed in accordance with sfas management does not assert that such pro forma numbers are superior to the as reported results  however  the pro forma numbers may help investors compare results including stock option expense across both periods 
although the company is now using the lattice binomial option pricing formula for valuing stock options granted beginning in whereas previously the company had used the black scholes merton option pricing formula  management believes that the lattice binomial and the black scholes merton option pricing formulas  with the assumptions used by the company  result in fair values which are substantially similar in all material respects 
as a result  the company believes that the as reported amounts under sfas r are comparable to the pro forma amounts as previously disclosed under sfas year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenues increased to billion for from billion for net revenues from covance s early development segment grew on strong performance in our global toxicology  chemistry and clinical pharmacology services 
net revenues from covance s late stage development segment grew  driven by strong performance in our central laboratory services 
cost of revenue increased to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period

income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
the million increase over the prior year was driven primarily by strength in our global toxicology and chemistry services  partially offset by softness in our research products and dilution resulting from the acquisition of radiant research inc radiant 
the dilutive impact on operating margins from radiant was basis points 
income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the corresponding period

the reduction from million in to million in is primarily due to lower stock based and incentive compensation and professional fees in the year ended december  other income  net increased million to million for from million for primarily as a result of a million increase in net interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances and higher average interest rates earned on those balances in covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the corresponding period

income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by strong performances in our central laboratory and cardiac safety services 
corporate expense increased million to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the increase is primarily attributable to increased centralized information technology and human resources costs  incentive compensation accruals and professional fees 
other income  net of million for increased million compared to million for this increase is the result of a million increase in interest income due primarily to higher average interest rates earned on invested cash balances combined with a million decrease in interest expense due to lower amortized loan fees associated with our revolving credit facility which were partially offset by a million increase in foreign exchange transaction losses 
results for include the impact of a one time million income tax charge associated with the repatriation of million of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of see notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
below is a reconciliation between the amounts as reported on a gaap basis and amounts as adjusted on a non gaap basis to exclude the impact of the million repatriation related tax charge 
this information is provided because management believes that results including this million one time tax charge are not indicative of covance s operational results and  as this non gaap measure is used by management as a basis for evaluating the company s performance  investors understanding of covance s performance is enhanced by such disclosure 
dollars in thousands  except earnings per share data year ended december  as reported removal of tax charge as adjusted taxes on income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the corresponding period 
the basis point increase in covance s effective tax rate is due to the one time million income tax charge associated with the repatriation of million of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act 
taxes on income of million would have been million  or million lower  excluding this one time tax charge  and the effective tax rate of would have been or basis points lower than the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to a number of factors  including the mix of our pre tax earnings across various tax jurisdictions  research and development tax credits in the united kingdom  and other planning initiatives 
covance has a minority equity position approximately at december  in bio imaging technologies  inc biti 
biti uses proprietary medical imaging technologies to process and analyze medical images  and also provides other services  including the data basing and regulatory submission of medical images  quantitative data and text 
during the years ended december  and  covance recognized a loss of million and income of million  respectively  representing its pro rata share of biti s earnings losses 
covance has a minority equity position in noveprim limited  an existing supplier of research products 
covance began recognizing earnings from this investment in the second quarter of during the years ended december  and  covance recognized million and million  respectively  representing its share of noveprim s earnings  less the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from noveprim limited and still on hand at covance at december  and net income of million for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to million for the corresponding period 
excluding the one time million income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act  net income would have been million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the corresponding period 
quarterly results covance s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant drug development trials  termination or reduction in size of drug development trials  acquisitions and divestitures  changes in the mix of our services  and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by covance s customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by covance 
since a large amount of covance s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  moderate variations in the commencement  progress or completion of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly results 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results of covance for each of the eight most recent fiscal quarters during the period ended december  in the opinion of covance  the information in the table below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for those periods

liquidity and capital resources covance has a centralized cash management function 
in the united states  cash received from operations is swept daily to a centrally managed concentration account  while cash disbursements for operations are funded as needed from the concentration account 
excess cash balances are invested in high quality money market funds of short duration 
outside of the united states  cash balances are generally pooled by currency in order to facilitate cash management and improve investment returns 
as in the united states  cash balances are generally maintained in the functional currency of the operating unit 
covance s expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible future acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible share repurchases 
covance s million revolving credit facility the credit facility expires in june and may be expanded to million at covance s election 
covance believes cash from operations will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 
interest on all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a basis point margin 
costs associated with the credit facility consisted primarily of bank fees totaling million which are being amortized over the five year facility term 
the credit facility contains various financial and other covenants 
at december   covance was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
the credit facility is collateralized by guarantees of certain of covance s domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of percent of the capital stock of certain of covance s foreign subsidiaries 
a commitment fee of basis points on the undrawn balance of the credit facility is payable in arrears on the first day of each july  october  january and april  and totaled approximately million during each of the years ended december  and as discussed in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  and as set forth in the table below  covance is obligated under non cancelable operating leases  primarily for its offices and laboratory facilities 
covance is also obligated under outsourcing agreements related to certain aspects of its information technology and human resources support functions and purchase commitments related to the completion of ongoing facility expansions  both of which are reflected under the caption purchase obligations in the table below 
actual amounts paid under these outsourcing agreements could be higher or lower than the amounts shown below as a result of changes in volume and other variables 
in addition  early termination of these outsourcing agreements by covance could result in the payment of termination fees which are not reflected in the table below

recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
as of december   covance has adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas  which require an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation as an asset or liability  respectively  in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status of the plan in the year in which such changes occur through other comprehensive income

sfas also requires  effective for fiscal years ending after december   that the measurement of the over funded or under funded status of a plan be made as of the employer s fiscal year end and not as of an earlier measurement date 
covance will be required to conform the measurement dates of its plans to december st for its fiscal year ending december  covance does not expect this change in measurement dates to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas  which applies whenever other standards require or permit fair value measurement  defines fair value and provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used in those measurements and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
covance will be required to adopt sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   no later than the quarter beginning january  covance is currently in the process of evaluating sfas  and has not yet determined the impact  if any  sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position

in june  the emerging issues taskforce reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf which addresses the income statement disclosure on taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer 
taxes within the scope of eitf include sales taxes  use taxes  value added taxes and some types of excise taxes 
for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  eitf  which is effective for interim periods beginning after december   requires disclosure of the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period in which an income statement is presented 
covance currently accounts for such taxes on a net basis  therefore  eitf is not expected to have any impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position
