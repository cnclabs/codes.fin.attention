item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  describe certain business risks 
consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the safe harbor statement at the beginning of this annual report on form k  in conjunction with reviewing the forward looking statements and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
raw material prices our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices 
our principal raw material is flat rolled steel  which we purchase from multiple primary steel producers 
the steel industry as a whole has been cyclical  and at times availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include general economic conditions  domestic and worldwide demand  curtailed production at major mills due to factors such as equipment breakdowns  repairs or catastrophic events  labor costs or problems  competition  import duties  tariffs  energy costs  availability and cost of steel inputs eg ore  scrap  coke  energy  etc  currency exchange rates and those other factors described below under raw material 
table of contents availability 
this volatility can significantly affect our steel costs 
in an environment of increasing prices for steel and other raw materials  competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers and to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  our financial results could be adversely affected 
also  if steel prices  in general  decrease  competitive conditions may impact how quickly we must reduce our prices to our customers and we could be forced to use higher priced raw materials to complete orders for which the sales prices have decreased 
raw material availability the costs of manufacturing our products and the ability to supply our customers could be negatively impacted if we experience interruptions in deliveries of needed raw materials or supplies 
if  for any reason  our supply of flat rolled steel or other key raw materials  such as aluminum  zinc  and nickel is curtailed or we are otherwise unable to obtain the quantities we need at competitive prices  our business could suffer and our financial results could be adversely affected 
such interruptions might result from a number of factors including events such as a shortage of capacity in the supplier base or of the raw materials  energy or the inputs needed to make steel or other supplies  financial difficulties of suppliers  significant events affecting their facilities  significant weather events  those factors listed above under raw material prices or other factors beyond our control 
further  the number of suppliers has decreased in recent years due to industry consolidation and the financial difficulties of certain suppliers  and consolidation may continue 
accordingly  if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternative supply than in the past 
inventories our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers including  in many cases  short lead times and just in time delivery requirements 
although we typically have customer orders in hand prior to placement of our raw material orders for steel processing  we anticipate and forecast customer demand for all business segments 
we purchase raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon orders  customer volume expectations  historic buying practices and market conditions 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in the use of higher priced inventory to fill orders reflecting lower sales prices  if steel prices have significantly decreased 
these events could adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages might result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  and result in lost revenues  any of which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results 
economic or industry downturns downturns or weakness in the economy in general or in key industries  such as commercial construction or automotive  may adversely affect our customers  which may cause the demand for our products and services to decline and adversely affect our financial results 
many of our customers are in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and affected by changes in general economic conditions or conditions specific to their respective markets  such as the commercial construction and automotive industries 
product demand in our customer s end markets is based on numerous factors such as interest rates  general economic conditions  consumer confidence  and other factors beyond our control 
downturns in demand from the commercial construction industry  the automotive industry or any of the other industries we serve  or a decrease in the margins that we can realize from sales of our products to customers in any of these industries  could adversely affect our financial results 
reduced commercial construction activity  especially office building  could negatively impact our financial results 
the commercial construction market is a key end market with approximately of our net sales 
table of contents going to that market in fiscal if commercial construction activity in the united states  in general  or by one or more of our major customers  in particular  were to be reduced significantly  it could negatively affect our sales and financial results 
reduced automotive truck production and the financial difficulties of customers in this market could negatively impact our financial results 
the automotive and truck market remains a key customer group with approximately of our net sales derived from that market in fiscal total domestic automotive production in fiscal was at a relatively high level on an historical basis 
if domestic automotive production  in general  or by one or more of our major domestic customers  in particular  were to be reduced significantly  it could negatively affect our sales and financial results 
the financial difficulties and internal strategies of customers could adversely affect us 
a portion of our business is highly dependent on automotive manufacturers  many of which have publicly announced plans to reduce production levels and eliminate excess manufacturing capacity including plans to eliminate jobs and reduce costs 
the financial difficulties of certain customers and the efforts under way by our customers to improve their overall financial condition could result in numerous changes that are beyond our control  including additional unannounced customer plant closings  decreased production  changes in product mix or distribution patterns  volume reductions  labor disruptions  collectibility of our accounts receivable  mandatory reductions or other unfavorable changes in our pricing  terms or service conditions or market share losses  as well as other changes we may not accurately anticipate 
these events could adversely impact our financial results 
the loss of significant volume from key customers could adversely affect us 
in fiscal  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our gross sales  and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our gross sales 
a significant loss of  or decrease in business from  customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial results if we cannot obtain replacement business 
also  due to consolidation in the industries we serve  including the commercial construction  automotive and retail industries  our gross sales may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments with respect to  one or more of our top customers 
in fiscal  one of our largest customers announced a change in ownership 
although we expect that our opportunities with this customer may be positively impacted by this change  it is possible that we will be negatively impacted 
competition our business is highly competitive  and increased competition could negatively impact our financial results 
generally  the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive 
competition for most of our products is primarily on the basis of price  product quality  and our ability to meet delivery requirements 
increased competition could cause us to lose market share  increase expenditures  lower our margins or offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could adversely impact our financial results 
material substitution in certain applications  steel competes with other materials  such as aluminum particularly in the automobile industry  cement and wood particularly in the construction industry  composites  glass and plastic 
prices of all of these materials fluctuate widely and differences between them and steel prices may adversely affect demand for our products and or encourage substitution  which could adversely affect prices and demand for steel products 
freight and energy the availability and cost of freight and energy  such as electricity  natural gas  and diesel fuel  is important in the manufacture and transport of our products 
our operating costs increase when energy costs rise 
during periods of increasing freight and energy costs  we might not be able to fully recover our operating cost increases 
table of contents through price increases without reducing demand for our products 
our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to pass all of the increases on to our customers or if we are unable to obtain the necessary freight and energy 
information systems we are subject to information system security risks and systems integration issues that could disrupt our internal operations 
we are dependent upon information technology for the distribution of information internally and also to our customers and suppliers 
this information technology is subject to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including but not limited to computer viruses  security breaches and defects in design 
there also could be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly 
we are currently in the process of implementing a new software based enterprise resource planning system erp 
various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information system and network disruptions  but a system failure or failure to implement new systems properly could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions disruptions to our business or the business of our customers or suppliers  could adversely impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions  including increased costs for or interruptions in the supply of energy or raw materials  resulting from severe weather events such as hurricanes  floods  blizzards  from casualty events  such as fires or material equipment breakdown  from acts of terrorism  from pandemic disease  from labor disruptions  or from other events such as required maintenance shutdowns  could cause interruptions to our businesses as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers 
such interruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
foreign economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international financial results 
although the substantial majority of our business activity takes place in the united states  we derive a portion of our revenues and earnings from operations in foreign countries  and are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we have wholly owned facilities in austria  canada  the czech republic and portugal and joint venture facilities in china  france  mexico  spain and the united kingdom 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include the potential for adverse changes in the local political climate  in diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the united states or in government policies  laws or regulations  terrorist activity that may cause social disruption  logistical and communications challenges  costs of complying with a variety of laws and regulations  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations  deterioration of foreign economic conditions  currency rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  differing local business practices and cultural considerations  restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply and changes in duties or taxes 
we believe that our business activities outside of the united states involve a higher degree of risk than our domestic activities 
joint ventures a change in the relationship between the members of our joint ventures may have an adverse effect on that joint venture 
worthington has been successful in the development and operation of various joint ventures  and equity in net income from our joint ventures  particularly wave  has been important to our financial results 
we believe an important element in the success of any joint venture is a solid relationship between the members of that joint venture 
if there is a change in ownership  a change of control  a change in management or other event with respect to a member that adversely impacts the relationship between the members  it may adversely impact the joint venture 

table of contents acquisitions we may not be able to manage and integrate future acquisitions successfully 
some of our growth has been through acquisitions 
we continue to seek additional businesses to acquire in the future 
there are no assurances  however  that any acquisition opportunities will arise or  if they do  that they will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
in addition  acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations  that business judgments concerning the value  strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect  that the acquired businesses may not be integrated successfully and that the acquisitions may strain our management resources 
accounting tax estimates we are required to make accounting and tax related estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is dependent on future events  or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
the estimates and the assumptions having the greatest amount of uncertainty  subjectivity and complexity are related to our accounting for bad debts  returns and allowances  self insurance  derivatives  deferred income taxes  and asset impairments 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
claims and insurance adverse claims experience  to the extent not covered by insurance  may have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we self insure a significant portion of our potential liability for workers compensation costs  product liability claims and recall exposure  general liability claims  employee medical claims and casualty risks 
in order to reduce risk and better manage our overall loss exposure  we purchase stop loss or other insurance from licensed insurance carriers that covers most claims in excess of the deductible or retained amounts 
we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost to resolve open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the occurrence of significant claims  losses on recalls  our failure to adequately reserve for such claims  a significant cost increase to maintain our insurance  or the failure of our insurance provider to perform  could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
principal shareholder our principal shareholder may have the ability to exert significant influence in matters requiring a shareholder vote and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of worthington industries 
pursuant to our charter documents  certain matters such as those in which a person would attempt to acquire or take control of the company  must be approved by the vote of of worthington industries outstanding voting power 
approximately of our outstanding common shares may be voted by john h 
mcconnell  our founder 
as a result of his voting power  john h 
mcconnell may have the ability to exert significant influence in these matters and other proposals which our shareholders vote upon
