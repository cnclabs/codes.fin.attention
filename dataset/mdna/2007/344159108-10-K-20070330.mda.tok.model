item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contract revenue  customer programs and incentives  product returns  accounts receivable allowances  inventory valuation allowances  warranty accruals  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  the value of equity instruments issued for services  the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for product returns based primarily on historical return rates  return policies and price protection arrangements 
in addition  we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations with customers  which include price discounts  credits and returns  when demand for specific products falls below expectations 
if market conditions for our products were to decline  we could experience an increase in the volume of returns and our reported revenue would be affected accordingly 
however  currently only a limited number of our consumer channel distributors have return rights under their agreements with us 
in connection with these agreements  distributors may return or exchange slow moving inventory held by such distributors 
however  these return rights are limited to of the distributor s prior quarter purchases 
we recognize contract revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of the contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as a contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for the entire amount of estimated losses  or uncompleted contracts are made in the periods such losses are determined 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and past transaction history with the customer 
although collateral is generally not requested  in certain situations we will require confirmed letters of credit or cash in advance of shipping to specific customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by component and product failure rates 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes review of materials usage  market conditions and product life cycles and an analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand and market conditions 
we reserve for inventories that are considered excess or obsolete 
we adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of revenue 
we use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the possible future impairment expense that we may incur  and in the case of intangible assets  the amount of future period amortization expense 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets which will reduce their value and could affect current period reported earnings 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  and no impairment was recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations overview in  both our systems and semiconductor groups demonstrated significant growth in revenue and gross margin 
overall company revenue grew and gross margin improved as a percentage of revenue by year over year from to 
the systems group s revenue growth reflects the trend to high definition video format and the need for greater storage capacity in a digital world 
professional and prosumer videographers are using hd more frequently in their recording and post production activities 
we believe the growing number of daily network and cable telecasts  movies and other special programming now coming in hd  bodes well for demand in this key market segment 
the dramatic revenue growth from our semiconductor group was primarily due to customers incorporating our video convergence chips in their portable media player designs 
as digital media is being transported through an ever increasing number of devices  demand for semiconductor convergence chips  like those of our semiconductor group  is increasing in parts of the electronics sector  including end products for portable media players  automotive and mobile entertainment  iptv set top boxes  medical imaging  and handheld gps systems 
we expect the factors that drove our revenue increase in the trend to hd products and the success of our video convergence chips to continue in however  a significant portion of our semiconductor revenue was associated with the introduction of one new consumer product by a well known consumer electronics ce company 
the product includes integrated components which use our video convergence chips 
we shipped a large volume of our products to meet this manufacturer s demand and do not know how many of its products were shipped  and of those shipped  how many were sold to end users 
we do not know if the ce company will re order our chips for use in subsequent versions of its product 
if we do not receive subsequent orders  we would have to replace the lost revenue in order to duplicate or improve upon last year s results 
failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations 
the impact of higher margin products and increased revenue increased our absolute gross margin as a percentage of revenue by  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in  we continued to make a significant investment in research and development which resulted in significant progress in developing our uwb wireless video technology 
in the second half of  we began shipping engineering samples of these uwb chips in our evaluation and verification kit 
we expect to begin shipments of production uwb chips in the second half of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue years ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase systems products semiconductor products revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million compared with the year ended december  for the year ended december   sales of systems products were approximately million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was due to the strong sales of our high definition direct to edit firestore product line with our camera partners panasonic  jvc  and canon and increased sales of proxsys  partially offset by decreased sales of our mature mixer and scan version products 
revenue from our mixer product has been trending lower over the past months as video enthusiasts continue to move from stand alone editing systems to computer based or non linear editing systems 
sales of semiconductor products to distributors and oem customers were approximately million in the year ended december   compared to million for the million increase in sales of semiconductor products approximately was primarily driven by customers incorporating our video convergence chips in their portable media player pmp designs 
for the year ended december   one semiconductor customer represented approximately of our total revenue and approximately of our semiconductor revenue 
at december   our backlog was approximately million for products ordered by customers  compared to a backlog of  at december  this increase reflects increased orders for our portable direct to edit products and video convergence chips 
our backlog frequently varies and is not indicative of quarterly performance for the products covered by such orders 
gross margin years ended december  dollars in thousands increase gross margin gross margin rate percentage points our gross margin rate for the year ended december  increased as a percentage of revenue by to from in the year ended december  this increase in the gross margin rate mainly reflects an increase in sales of our higher margin direct to edit hd recorders  higher margin semiconductor chips  and overall sales volume

the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses overtime  employer taxes  benefits  commission and bonus of  partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of  and a decrease in recruiting expenses of  stock based compensation charges of  and  for the years ended december  and respectively  were included in general and administrative expenses 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  compared to the year ended december  and an decline as a percentage of revenue for the same period 
the decrease in research and development expenses mainly reflects a decrease in consulting and temporary help expenses of million related to our uwb chip design  partially offset by an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses overtime  employer taxes  benefits  commission and bonus of  increase of stock compensation charges of  increased material and prototyping charges of  increased license fees of  for design tools and tooling expenses of  related to our uwb initiative 
the lower consulting and temporary help expense is due to the uwb development project moving from the chip design phase to the production phase 
stock based compensation charges of  for the year ended december  was included in research and development expenses 
no stock based compensation charges were included for the year ended december  in  to complete our uwb products we plan continued significant investment in the development and production of the uwb technology see note  management s plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements

this increase mainly reflects interest expense on convertible notes  of which million   and  were issued on january   june  and december   respectively  and remained outstanding on december  additionally  during the fourth quarter of  a charge of  was recorded to interest expense as a result of the issuance of the december  convertible notes 
on the date of issuance  the fair market value of our stock exceeded the conversion price of the convertible notes  resulting in a beneficial conversion feature 
the million derivative liability represents the fair value of the conversion option in connection with the million convertible notes issued in january the value of the conversion option was bifurcated from the debt host contract and recorded as a derivative liability  which resulted in a discount to the initial carrying amount of the convertible notes 
the million discount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statements of operations as value of derivative security since the notes may be converted to common stock at any time after issuance 
effective june   we amended certain agreements associated with the million convertible notes  eliminating the derivative component 
however  we were required to revalue the derivative liability as of the amendment date 
therefore  as a result of fluctuations in the price of our common stock  and its volatility between the date the notes were issued and the june  amendment date  the fair value of the derivative liability increased by million resulting in an additional million expense charge for the year ended december  other income expense for the years ended december  and consists mainly of fluctuations associated with exchange rate differences related to transactions denominated in foreign currency

this increase in sales of our systems products mainly reflects the introduction of a new variation of firestore the fs and sales of products acquired through the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our consumer scan conversion and home theater products 
our consumer scan conversion product sales have decreased in recent years as an increasing number of personal computers and televisions now incorporate scan conversion technology 
we discontinued our home theater line in sales of semiconductor products to distributors and oem customers were approximately million in the year ended december   compared to million for the  decrease in sales of semiconductor products approximately mainly reflects a million decrease in sales of our fs chip  partially offset by production ramps in for internet protocol television iptv set top boxes and portable media players by our customers incorporating our chips in their device designs 
the decrease in sales of our fs chip was primarily due to microsoft ceasing significant orders for the fs in january the fs had been used by microsoft in its xbox 
at december   we had a backlog of approximately  for products ordered by customers  compared to a backlog of million at december  the decrease between december  and december  reflects orders for our digital video mixer and firestore products at december   reflecting delays in these new product releases until the first quarter of our backlog orders frequently vary and are not indicative of quarterly performance for the products reflected in such order backlogs 
gross margin years ended december  dollars in thousands increase gross margin gross margin rate percentage points our gross margin rate for the year ended december  increased as a percentage of revenue by to from in the year ended december  the increase in gross margin rate mainly reflects increased sales volumes  the below average gross margin business that we had conducted with microsoft in the three months ended march   which did not occur in the year ended december    of inventory acquired from como and visual circuits and sold in at low margin  and an accrual in of  for a royalty payment based on the achievement of certain sales volumes 
these factors were partially offset by the increase in sales discounts and low margin chip sales to one customer in the year ended december  operating expenses years ended december  increase of of of dollars in thousands revenue revenue revenue sales  marketing and support general and administrative research and development sales  marketing and support sales  marketing and support expenses for year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from the prior year 
the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses mainly reflects an increase in salary expense of  resulting from an overall increase in headcount of in our business development and customer support departments and semiconductor group 
also contributing to the increase sales  marketing and support expenses were additional advertising expenses of  associated with introductions of our new fs and mixer products  and increased sales and representative commission expense of  as a result of increased revenue attributable to our new products 
the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses also reflects  to a lesser extent  the inclusion of visual circuits and como s sales and marketing expenses for the entire period 
visual circuits and como s expenses were only partially included in the year ended december  as the respective acquisitions occurred on may  and february   respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in personnel and personnel related costs of  mainly reflecting the addition of three employees  stock compensation charges of  related to restricted stock and warrants expensed in  and the extension of employee stock options in research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expenses reflects almost entirely our investment in uwb technology  which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses of million over those in this increased investment in uwb consisted mainly of an increase in semiconductor design service fees of million  increased personnel costs of million  reflect employees hired during the later part of and six additional employees hired during  and an increase in direct material and prototyping costs of  the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december   was partially offset by expense reductions in our systems business research and development activities mainly reflecting decreased prototyping material costs

in connection with this credit line  greater bay bank obtained a first priority security interest on our accounts receivable through an agreement with mr 
berg  which enabled mr 
berg to retain his existing security interest in all of our assets while subordinating to greater bay bank his security interest in our accounts receivable 
the bank credit line is subject to ongoing covenants  including a covenant related to operating results 
interest is payable under this loan at prime plus as of december

the term loan has a maturity date of february   is interest only until maturity and is in addition to our existing million accounts receivable based secured line of credit facility described above with this same bank 
interest is payable under this loan at prime plus as of december  
at december   there was an outstanding balance under this term loan of the maximum available amount of million 
on january   we raised gross proceeds of million from the issuance of secured convertible notes to a group of private investors 
interest accrues on the principal amount of the notes at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually 
the notes are convertible into shares of focus common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are due january  and are secured by all of the assets of focus 
under certain circumstances  including a change in control or our failure to continue to be listed on the nasdaq stock market  the due date of the notes may be accelerated 
on june  and december   in accordance with the terms of the secured convertible notes  we issued an additional  and  of convertible notes in lieu of a cash interest payment due on june  and december   respectively 
we are permitted to issue an additional note to satisfy our interest obligations under the secured convertible notes for the interest payment due june  subsequent developments we received gross proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock to a group of private investors in february while we believe that these funds  along with the cash flow generated by our anticipated growth in our semiconductor and systems businesses  should be adequate to enable us to complete our uwb engineering development and launch commercialization of uwb products 
depending upon the results and timing of our uwb initiative and the growth of our semiconductor and systems businesses  we may need to raise further capital in or in subsequent years 
and future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including cash flow from operations  maintaining our gross margins at current levels  continued progress in research and development programs  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market our products successfully

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   we did not hold any short term investments that would be exposed to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates 
at december   our outstanding debt obligations  which have variable interest rates  consisted of a term loan of million and borrowings under a line of credit of million 
the variable interest rate applicable to these debt obligations was per annum 
if short term interest rates were to increase basis points basis points equals  the increased interest expense associated with these debt obligations would be approximately  on an annual basis 
foreign currency risk due to our reliance on international and export sales  we are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a substantial majority of our international and export revenue  as well as expenses  are typically denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
gains or losses related to foreign exchange currency transactions were not material for the years ended december   and a movement in the eur usd exchange rate would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
