you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this form k 
overview we own  operate and manage treatment centers focused principally on providing radiation treatment alternatives ranging from conventional external beam radiation to newer  technologically advanced options 
we believe we are the largest company in the united states focused principally on providing radiation therapy 
we opened our first radiation treatment center in and as of december  we provided radiation therapy services in treatment centers 
our treatment centers are clustered into local markets in states  including alabama  arizona  california  delaware  florida  kentucky  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  nevada  new jersey  new york  north carolina  rhode island  and west virginia 
of these treatment centers  treatment centers were internally developed  were acquired and involve hospital based treatment centers 
we have recently expanded our affiliation with physician specialties in other areas including gynecological and surgical oncology and urology in a limited number of our local markets to strengthen our clinical working relationships 
we use a number of metrics to assist management in evaluating financial condition and operating performance  and the most important follow the number of treatments delivered per day in our freestanding centers the average revenue per treatment in our freestanding centers the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio the principal costs of operating a treatment center are the salary and benefits of the physician and technical staff  and equipment and facility costs 
the capacity of each physician and technical position is limited to a number of delivered treatments while equipment and facility costs for a treatment center are generally fixed 
these capacity factors cause profitability to be very sensitive to treatment volume 
profitability will tend to increase as the available staff and equipment capacities are utilized 
the average revenue per treatment is sensitive to the mix of services used in treating a patient s tumor 
the reimbursement rates set by medicare and commercial payers tend to be higher for the more advanced treatment technologies  reflecting their higher complexity 
this metric is used by management to evaluate the utilization of newer technologies to improve outcomes for patients 
a key part of our business strategy is to implement advanced technologies once supporting economics are available 
for example  we implemented a pilot stereotactic radiosurgery program using kv x rays in one of our centers in and  with expanded reimbursement for the technology available january   we are accelerating the implementation of this new technology across our local markets 
the reimbursement for radiation therapy services includes a professional component for the physician s service and a technical component to cover the costs of the machine  facility and services provided by the technical staff 
in our freestanding centers we provide both services while in a hospital based center the hospital  rather than us  provides the technical services 
fees that we receive from the hospital for services they purchase from us are included in other revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
net patient service revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is derived from our freestanding centers and from the professional services provided by our doctors in hospital based centers and by our physicians in other specialties in their practice offices 

table of contents for the year ended december   our total revenues and net income grew by and  respectively  over the prior year 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million and net income of million 
our results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to fluctuate 
many of the patients of our florida treatment centers are part time residents in florida during the winter months 
hence  these treatment centers have historically experienced higher utilization rates during the winter months than during the remainder of the year 
in addition  referrals are typically lower in the summer months due to traditional vacation periods 
the following table summarizes our growth in treatment centers and the local markets in which we operate year ended december  treatment centers at beginning of period internally developed internally consolidated acquired hospital based treatment centers at period end local markets at period end excludes the acquisition of the bel air  maryland radiation treatment center  as we expect to combine the external beam treatments done at our belcamp  maryland radiation treatment center 
during the first quarter of  we incurred an impairment loss of million related to the consolidation of two yonkers  new york based treatment centers within our westchester bronx local market 
during the second quarter of  we incurred expenses of approximately million associated with the transition of an internally developed freestanding center to a hospital based radiation treatment center at northern westchester hospital within our westchester bronx local market

new centers are added to existing markets based on capacity  convenience  and competitive considerations 
our net income growth is primarily driven by revenue growth and the leveraging of our technical and administrative infrastructures 

table of contents for the year ended december   net patient service revenue comprised of our total revenues 
in a state where we can employ radiation oncologists  we derive our net patient service revenue through fees earned for the provision of the professional and technical component fees of radiation therapy services 
in states where we do not employ radiation oncologists  we derive our administrative services fees principally from administrative services agreements with professional corporations 
in of our freestanding radiation treatment centers we employ the physicians  and in we operate pursuant to administrative services agreements 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board revised interpretation no 
r fin no 
r  we consolidate the operating results of certain of the professional corporations for which we provide administrative services into our own operating results 
in  of our net patient service revenue was generated by professional corporations with which we have administrative services agreements 
in states which prohibit us from employing physicians  we have long term administrative services agreements with professional corporations owned by certain of our directors  officers and principal shareholders  who are licensed to practice medicine in such states 
we have entered into these administrative services agreements in order to comply with the laws of such states 
our administrative services agreements generally obligate us to provide treatment center facilities  staff and equipment  accounting services  billing and collection services  management and administrative personnel  assistance in managed care contracting and assistance in marketing services 
we receive a monthly fee for our services based one of the following models on a fixed fee arrangement on a percentage of net revenues on a percentage of net income and fixed fee per treatment 
fees related to administrative services agreements that are based on a fixed rate are set at the beginning of each year on the basis of the estimated cost of these services plus a profit margin 
we engage an independent consultant to complete a fair market value review of the fees paid by related party professional service corporations to the company under the terms of these agreements each year 
the consulting firm completed its review of fees under these agreements and determined that the fees are at fair market value 
independent consultants are utilized by the company s audit committee in determining fair market fees upon any renewal or for new administrative services agreements with affiliates 
in our net patient service revenue for the years ended december    and  revenue from the professional only component of radiation therapy and revenue from the practices of medical specialties other than radiation oncology  comprised approximately   and respectively of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   other revenue comprised approximately of our total revenues 
other revenue is primarily derived from management services provided to hospital radiation therapy departments  technical services provided to hospital radiation therapy departments  billing services provided to non affiliated physicians and income for equipment leased by joint venture entities 
medicare is a major funding source for the services we provide and government reimbursement developments can have a material effect on operating performance 
these developments include the reimbursement amount for each cpt service current procedural terminology that we provide and the specific cpt services covered by medicare 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  the government agency responsible for administering the medicare program  administers an annual process for considering changes in reimbursement rates and covered services 
we have played and will continue to play a role in that process both directly and through the radiation oncology professional societies 
other material factors that we believe will also impact our future financial performance include continued advances in technology and the related capital requirements 
continued affiliation with physician specialties other than radiation oncology 
increased costs associated with changes in the accounting for stock compensation 
proposed changes in accounting for business combinations requiring that all acquisition related costs be expensed as incurred 
increased costs associated with being a public company including compliance with sarbanes oxley section reporting on internal control 

table of contents acquisitions and developments we expect to continue to acquire and develop treatment centers in connection with the implementation of our growth strategy 
over the past three years  we have acquired treatment centers and internally developed treatment centers 
on june  we acquired the assets of devoto construction  inc  which was owned by certain of our directors and officers for approximately  with the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
devoto construction  inc performs remodeling and real property improvements at our medical facilities and specializes in the construction of radiation medical facilities 
in september  we acquired three treatment centers in the state of new jersey for a total consideration of million  and we opened three internally developed treatment centers 
one of these internally developed treatment centers replaced services we had previously provided through a hospital based center 
on april   we sold a interest in a joint venture that was formed to operate a treatment center located in berlin  maryland 
the interest was sold to a healthcare enterprise operating in the area for million 
we realized a gain of approximately  on the sale of the interest 
on april   we acquired a interest in a single radiation therapy treatment center located in martinsburg  west virginia for approximately million 
we operate the facility as part of our central maryland local market 
under the terms of the agreement  we partner with a university hospital system and manage the facility 
we have implemented an intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt program and other advanced technologies at the facility 
in may  we acquired five radiation treatment centers located in clark county  nevada from associated radiation oncologists  inc for million  plus a three year contingent earn out 
we expanded the availability of advanced radiation therapy treatment modalities in the service area 
this acquisition expanded our presence in nevada where we operated four centers before the acquisition 
in june  we acquired four radiation treatment centers located in the markets of scottsdale  arizona  holyoke  massachusetts  and two centers in maryland for approximately million 
this acquisition provided our first entrance into two new local markets in arizona and massachusetts 
the two centers purchased in maryland will further expand our presence in our central maryland local market 
we have expanded the availability of advanced radiation therapy treatment modalities in certain of the service areas 
during the second quarter of we were awarded a contract to develop a state of the art radiation center at the prestigious roger williams hospital in providence  rhode island 
as of june  we were providing professional services at the hospital 
we have also obtained a certificate of need and are developing a joint venture freestanding radiation therapy center with the hospital 
in september  we opened for business our south county  rhode island treatment center and began treating patients at the facility 
the center is our third center opened in our rhode island local market 
in november  we opened for business our palm springs  california treatment center and began treating patients at the facility 
the center was our th treatment center in operation and represented our entrance into our nd local market 
in december  we acquired the assets of a urology practice with four office locations in southwest florida for approximately  the urology practice provides additional service and treatment protocols to our patients with prostate cancer and other urological diseases 
in january  we acquired the assets of a radiation treatment center located in opp  alabama for approximately million 
the center purchased in alabama will further expand our presence in its southeastern alabama local market 
we expanded the availability of advanced radiation therapy treatment modalities in this service area 
in may  we acquired the assets of a radiation treatment center located in santa monica  california for approximately million 
the center purchased in california will further expand our presence into a second local market in the california area 

table of contents in august  we acquired the assets of a radiation treatment center located in bel air  maryland for approximately million 
the center purchased in maryland will further expand our presence in our central maryland local market 
in september  we acquired the assets of a radiation treatment center located in beverly hills  california for approximately million 
the center purchased in california will further expand our presence into our los angeles local market complementing the santa monica radiation center we purchased in may in november  we acquired a cluster network of radiation treatment centers in southeastern michigan for approximately million  including real estate of approximately million 
the acquisition provides us an entrance into a new local market 
the seven facility network consists of two full service facilities  five satellite facilities and certificates of need to operate a total of eight linear accelerators 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired the assets of several urology and surgery practices within southwest florida to expand our affiliations with other physicians to strengthen our clinical working relationships 
the operations of the foregoing acquisitions have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from the respective dates of each acquisition 
when we acquire a treatment center  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
in january  we acquired a interest in a single radiation therapy treatment center located in gettysburg pennsylvania for approximately  and we also acquired a urology group practice in southwest florida for approximately  sources of revenue by payer we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the government medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  managed care organizations and our patients directly 
generally  our revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payer mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net patient service revenue we earned by category of payer in our last three fiscal years 
years ended december  payer medicare commercial medicaid self pay total net patient service revenue medicare and medicaid since cancer disproportionately affects elderly people  a significant portion of our net patient service revenue is derived from the medicare program  as well as related co payments 
medicare reimbursement rates are determined by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and are lower than our normal charges 
medicaid reimbursement rates are typically lower than medicare rates  medicaid payments represent approximately of our net patient service revenue 
medicare reimbursement rates are determined by a formula which takes into account an industry wide conversion factor cf multiplied by relative values determined on a per procedure basis rvus 
the cf and rvus may change on an annual basis 
in  the cf increased by  in  it increased by  in  the rate increased an additional  and in the cf remained unchanged at the level 
the net result of changes to the cf and rvus over the last several years has not had a significant impact on our business  but it is difficult to forecast the future impact of any changes 
we depend on payments from government sources and any changes in medicare or medicaid programs could result in a decrease in our total revenues and net income 
on november   cms released its final rule for the medicare physician fee schedule 
the final rule included specific reimbursement codes for stereotactic procedures and provides for a four year transition to a new practice expense methodology for establishing practice expense values for services paid under the medicare physician fee schedule 
based on our review of the fee schedule  we do not expect the fee schedule to have a material impact on the total reimbursement of services provided to medicare beneficiaries 

table of contents commercial commercial sources include private health insurance as well as related payments for co insurance and co payments 
we enter into contracts with private health insurance and other health benefit groups by granting discounts to such organizations in return for the patient volume they provide 
most of our commercial revenue is from managed care business and is attributable to contracts where a set fee is negotiated relative to services provided by our treatment centers 
we do not have any contracts that individually represent over of our total net patient service revenue 
we receive our managed care contracted revenue under two primary arrangements 
approximately of our managed care business is attributable to contracts where a fee schedule is negotiated for services provided at our treatment centers 
approximately of our net patient service revenue is attributable to contracts where we bear utilization risk 
although the terms and conditions of our managed care contracts vary considerably  they are typically for a one year term and provide for automatic renewals 
if payments by managed care organizations and other private third party payers decrease  then our total revenues and net income could decrease 
self pay self pay consists of payments for treatments by patients not otherwise covered by third party payers  such as government or commercial sources 
because the incidence of cancer is much higher in those over the age of  most of our patients have access to medicare or other insurance and therefore the self pay portion of our business is less than it would be in other circumstances 
billing and collections our billing system utilizes a fee schedule for billing patients  third party payers and government sponsored programs  including medicare and medicaid 
fees billed to government sponsored programs  including medicare and medicaid  are automatically adjusted to the allowable payment amount at time of billing 
for all other payers  the actual contractual adjustment is recorded upon the receipt of payment 
as a result  an estimate of contractual allowances is made on a monthly basis to reflect the estimated realizable value of net patient service revenue 
the development of the estimate of contractual allowances is based on historical cash collections related to gross charges developed by facility and payer in order to calculate average collection percentages by facility and payer 
the development of the collection percentages are applied to gross accounts receivable in determining an estimate of contractual allowances at the end of a reporting period 
insurance information is requested from all patients either at the time the first appointment is scheduled or at the time of service 
a copy of the insurance card is scanned into our system at the time of service so that it is readily available to staff during the collection process 
patient demographic information is collected for both our clinical and billing systems 
it is our policy to collect co payments from the patient at the time of service 
insurance information is obtained and the patient is informed of their co payment responsibility prior to the commencement of treatment 
charges are posted to the billing system by our office financial managers 
after charges are posted  edits are performed  any necessary corrections are made and billing forms are generated  then sent electronically to our clearinghouse 
any bills not able to be processed through the clearinghouse are printed and mailed from our central billing office 
statements are automatically generated from our billing system and mailed to the patient on a monthly basis for any amounts still outstanding 
daily  weekly and monthly accounts receivable analysis reports are utilized by staff and management to prioritize accounts for collection purposes  as well as to identify trends and issues 
strategies to respond proactively to these issues are developed at weekly and monthly team meetings 
our write off process is manual and our process for collecting accounts receivable is dependent on the type of payer as set forth below 
self pay balances 
we administer self pay account balances through our central billing office and our policy is to send outstanding self pay patient claims to collection agencies at designated points in the collection process 
in some cases monthly payment arrangements are made with patients for the account balance remaining after insurance payments have been applied 
these accounts are reviewed monthly to ensure payments continue to be made in a timely manner 
once it has been 
table of contents determined by our staff that the patient is not responding to our collection attempts  a final notice is mailed 
this generally occurs more than days after the date of the original bill 
if there is no response to our final notice  after days the account is assigned to a collection agency  as appropriate  recorded as a bad debt and written off 
balances under are written off but not sent to the collection agency 
all accounts are specifically identified for write offs and accounts are written off prior to being submitted to the collection agency 
medicare  medicaid and commercial payer balances 
our central billing office staff expedites the payment process from insurance companies and other payers via electronic inquiries  phone calls and automated letters to ensure timely payment 
our billing system generates standard aging reports by date of billing in increments of day intervals 
the collection team utilizes these reports to assess and determine the payers requiring additional focus and collection efforts 
our accounts receivable exposure on medicare  medicaid and commercial payer balances are largely limited to contractual adjustments 
our exposure to bad debts on balances relating to these types of payers over the years has been de minimus 
in the event of denial of payment  we follow the payer s standard appeals process  both to secure payment and to lobby the payers  as appropriate  to modify their medical policies to expand coverage for the newer and more advanced treatment services that we provide which  in many cases  is the payer s reason for denial of payment 
if all reasonable collection efforts with these payers have been exhausted by our central billing office staff  the account receivable is written off to the contractual allowance 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s subjective or complex judgment because of the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation 
financial accounting standards board revised interpretation no 
r fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 requires a company to consolidate variable interest entities if the company is the primary beneficiary of the activities of those entities 
certain of our radiation oncology practices are variable interest entities as defined by fin no 
r  and we have a variable interest in each of these practices through our administrative services agreements 
through our variable interests in these practices  we would absorb a majority of the net losses of these practices  should they occur 
based on these determinations  we have included the radiation oncology practices in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
all of our significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
net patient service revenue and allowances for contractual discounts 
we have agreements with third party payers that provide us payments at amounts different from our established rates 
net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payers and others for services rendered 
net patient service revenue is recognized as services are provided 
medicare and other governmental programs reimburse physicians based on fee schedules  which are determined by the related government agency 
we also have agreements with managed care organizations to provide physician services based on negotiated fee schedules 
accordingly  the revenues reported in our consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount that is expected to be received 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from medicare  medicaid and other payers that receive discounts from our standard charges 
we must estimate the total amount of these discounts to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
the medicare and medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are complex and subject to interpretation and adjustment 
the development of the estimate of contractual allowances is based 
table of contents on historical cash collections related to gross charges developed by facility and payer in order to calculate average collection percentages by facility and payer 
the development of the collection percentages are applied to gross accounts receivable in determining an estimate of contractual allowances at the end of a reporting period 
the estimate for contractual allowances is also based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
these interpretations sometimes result in payments that differ from our original estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently  necessitating regular review and reassessment of the estimation process 
changes in estimates related to the allowance for contractual discounts affect revenues reported in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
adjustments to revenue related to changes in prior period estimates decreased patient service revenue by approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively or approximately   and of the net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  approximately   and  respectively  of net patient service revenue related to services rendered under the medicare and medicaid programs 
in the ordinary course of business  we are potentially subject to a review by regulatory agencies concerning the accuracy of billings and sufficiency of supporting documentation of procedures performed 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reported net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from third party payers and patients 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the credit risk for concentrations of receivables other than medicare is limited due to the large number of insurance companies and other payers that provide payments for our services 
we do not believe that there are any significant concentrations of receivables from any particular payer that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our accounts receivable 
following is an aging of accounts receivable by payer classification as of december  and aging by payer class at december  payer total ar unbilled and days days over days medicare and medicaid commercial patient self pay other total aging by payer class at december  payer total ar unbilled and days days over days medicare and medicaid commercial patient self pay other total 
table of contents the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage and other collection indicators 
the primary tool used in our assessment is an annual  detailed review of historical collections and write offs of accounts receivable 
the results of our detailed review of historical collections and write offs  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions  are used to evaluate the allowance amount for the current period 
accounts receivable are written off after collection efforts have been followed in accordance with our policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net assets we have acquired in business combinations 
on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
no goodwill impairment was recognized for the years ended december   and intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements and licenses and are amortized over the life of the agreements which typically range from to years using the straight line method 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
assessment of possible impairment of a particular asset is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of such asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during  we recorded a charge of million for the write down to fair value of certain of our analog linear accelerators and treatment simulators 
the adjustment to machine inventories was precipitated by the decision to discontinue the installation of this type of equipment in favor of digital machines with migration capability and combination ct simulators 
this amount is included in general and administrative expenses in the statement of income and comprehensive income for the year ended december  during  we incurred an impairment loss of million related to the consolidation of two yonkers  new york based treatment centers within our westchester bronx local market 
no impairments were recorded for long lived assets for the year ended december  stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r for the company s stock incentive plan option plan 
the company previously accounted for the option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transitions and disclosure sfas 
on november   the board of directors of the company  upon the recommendation of the compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors  approved the acceleration of vesting of all nonqualified outstanding non vested stock options previously granted under the company s equity compensation plans 
as a result of the acceleration  nonqualified non vested stock options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of the company s common stock  which would otherwise have vested over periods of two to four years  became immediately exercisable 
the affected stock options have an exercise price of per share 
the primary purpose of the acceleration of the nonqualified non vested stock options was to enable the company to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these stock options in future periods in its statement of income and comprehensive income  upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  the compensation expense associated with these accelerated options that would have been recognized in the company s income statement commencing with the implementation of sfas r and continuing through would have been approximately million 
because of the accelerated vesting  the adoption of sfas no 
r had no impact on net income 
certain stock options granted prior to the company s initial public offering were valued under sfas using the minimum value method in the pro forma disclosures 
the minimum value method excludes volatility in the calculation of fair value of stock based compensation 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  options granted that were valued using the minimum value method must be transitioned to sfas r using the prospective method 
this means that these options will continue to be accounted for under the same accounting principles recognition and measurement originally applied to those awards in the income statement  which for the company was apb additionally  pro forma information previously required under sfas and sfas will no longer be presented for these options 

table of contents the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method for all other stock based compensation awards 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes a the compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and b the compensation cost of all share based awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
income taxes 
we make estimates in recording our provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these benefits  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
new pronouncements in june the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition
