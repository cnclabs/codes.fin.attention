our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview and outlook we are an advanced oncology diagnostics services company 
our mission is to combine innovative technologies  meaningful test results and world class expertise to improve outcomes of patients suffering from cancer 
with the completion of the human genome project in the late s  medical science has entered a new era of diagnostics that will move us closer than ever before to understanding the molecular causes for complex diseases  particularly cancer 
as a result  the landscape of cancer management is undergoing significant change 
there is now an escalating need for advanced oncology testing to provide physicians with necessary information on the cellular profile of a specific tumor  enabling them to select the most appropriate therapies 
in  we completed the first stage of the transformation of our business from chromavision positioned as a medical device provider with a single application to clarient positioned as a technology and services company offering a full menu of advanced tests to assess and characterize cancer 
we gathered an experienced group of professionals from the anatomic pathology laboratory and the in vitro diagnostics businesses to carefully guide this transition 
we achieved a year of rapid growth by commercializing a set of services to provide the community pathologist with the latest in cancer diagnostic technology  anchored by our own proprietary image analysis technology and augmented by other key technologies 
in june  we signed a distribution and development agreement with dako a s dako  a danish company recognized as a worldwide leader in pathology diagnostics systems 
this enabled us to strengthen our legacy position as the leader in cellular digital image analysis with the acis automated image analysis system acis and accelerate our market penetration worldwide 
in  we focused on the execution of our plan to capitalize on the growth of the cancer diagnostics market 
we worked toward completing our operational milestones for our services business and our commitment to co develop the new acis iii with dako  which was launched in november we expanded on our base of immunohistochemistry ihc with the addition of flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish molecular testing 
these additions positioned clarient to move beyond solid tumor testing into the important area of leukemia lymphoma assessment 
we also completed a consolidation of our business with the move into a state of the art facility without disruption to our customers 
in march  we entered the second stage of our business strategy by selling our technology business which developed  manufactured and marketed the acis and related intellectual property assets the acis sale to carl zeiss microimaging  inc zeiss  an international leader in the optical and opto electronics industries 
the acis sale provides us the financial resources to focus our efforts on the most profitable and fastest growing opportunities within our services business 
we believe our strength as a leading cancer diagnostics laboratory  our deep domain expertise and access to robust intellectual property can propel our continued growth through the development of additional tests  unique analytical capabilities and other service offerings 
our focus is on identifying high quality opportunities to increase our profitability and differentiate clarient s service offerings in our highly competitive market 
an important aspect of our strategy is to create near and long term  high margin revenue generating opportunities by connecting our medical expertise with our intellectual property to develop novel diagnostic tests and analytical capabilities 
in addition  we are working to identify specific partners and technologies to assist in the commercialization of these novel markers 
novel markers  or biomarkers  are characteristics of an individual s tumor or disease that  once identified and qualified  allow for more accurate prognosis  diagnosis and treatment 
broader discovery and use of novel markers is hoped to clarify and simplify decisions for healthcare providers and the biopharmaceutical industry 
the growing demand for personalized medicine has generated a need for these novel diagnostics  creating a new market expected to reach billion in three to five years based on our internal estimates 
in  we will focus on four primary areas financial discipline to achieve break even in our cash flow from operations  operational discipline to achieve scaleable operations  commercial discipline to target the right customers  and strategic discipline to invest in high value expansion opportunities to create shareholder value 
key indicators of our financial condition and operating performance our business is complex  and management is faced with several key challenges to reach profitability 
we began providing in house laboratory services in to give us an opportunity to capture a significant service related revenue stream from the much broader and expanding cancer diagnostic testing marketplace 
the business continues to experience double digit growth  as a result of the excellent execution of our sales plan and solid market acceptance of our service offerings 
management must manage the growth of this business and provide infrastructure to support it  particularly related to facilities  quality assurance  billing  collections and business processes 
we have experienced improved gross margins  but have yet to reach optimal financial metrics related to cash flow and operating margins as we support our growing business 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  including diagnostic services administration  for the year ended december  were of total revenue  compared to in the prior year ended december  we expect this improving trend will continue as our revenues increase 
we have also faced the challenge of effectively managing the transition from selling acis systems directly to selling them through our distributor  dako  coupled with the introduction of a new version of acis developed to dako specifications 
we experienced a slower than expected implementation of our distribution arrangement as we transitioned to the new acis iii 
the delayed ramp up primarily resulted in our technology business experiencing a decline in revenue from million in to million in  and a corresponding decline in gross profit from million to million 
in march  we made the decision to sell our technology business including the acis systems business and the trestle assets acquired in september to zeiss 
as a result  going forward  instrument systems sales will no longer be a key indicator of our operating performance 
finally  we have been dependent on the use of both debt and equity financing to fund our operating losses and to sustain our growth in the future 
management believes that our existing cash resources  including the cash proceeds from the acis sale  together with access to our financing sources described below  will be sufficient to satisfy the cash needs of our existing operations throughout our financing sources include our million revolving line of credit with general electric capital corporation ge capital and a loan facility with comerica bank the comerica facility that provides a million revolving line of credit and a million stand by letter of credit for our landlord 
on march   we obtained a million subordinated revolving credit line from a safeguard affiliate 
additional information on these credit facilities is included under liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of the acis sale  beginning in our q for the quarter ending march   the technology business will be reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
characteristics of our revenue and expenses services group revenue 
revenues for our services group are derived primarily from billing insurers  pathologists and patients for the diagnostic services that we provide 
third party billing 
the majority of revenue currently generated by our services group is for patients covered by healthcare insurance  including medicare or other third party insurance companies such as blue cross 
in these situations  we bill an insurer that pays a percentage of the amount billed based on several factors including the type of coverage for example  hmo or ppo  whether the charges are considered to be in network or out of network  and the amount of any co payments or deductibles that the patient may have at that time 
our bills typically identify the service provided using billing codes known as common procedural terminology cpt codes 
the amounts that are paid to us are a function of the payers policies for paying claims of these types and whether we have specific agreements in place with the payers 
we also have a medicare supplier number that allows us to bill and collect from medicare 
client pathologist billing 
in some situations  we establish direct billing arrangements with our clients where we bill them for an agreed amount per test for the services provided and the client will then handle all billing directly with the private payers 
the amount that may be charged to our clients is determined in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations 
patient billing 
less than of our billings are billed directly to patients 
these billings can result from co payment obligations  patient deductibles  circumstances where certain tests are not covered by insurance companies  and patients without any health insurance 
technology group revenue 
revenues for our technology group were derived from fee per use  acis sales and development revenue 
we experienced a shift in this revenue model since as we completed various financing arrangements with third parties and strategic alliances with key distributors such as dako 
following the acis sale  we will not generate any further technology group revenue 
services group cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue includes laboratory personnel  laboratory related depreciation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct costs such as shipping 
most of our cost of revenue structure is variable  except for staffing and related expenses which are semi variable and depreciation which is mostly fixed 
technology group cost of revenue and gross margin 
the cost of revenue primarily consisted of cost for manufacturing the acis  including the cost for direct material  labor  manufacturing overhead  and direct customer support 
for fee per use revenue  the cost of the acis is depreciated over three years and for a system sale or sales type lease the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of sale 
most of our cost of revenue structure is fixed  except for variable costs of materials and overhead related to acis units sold following the acis sale  we will not generate any further technology group costs 
operating expenses operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  diagnostic services administration and research and development 
expenses within this category primarily consist of the salaries  benefits and costs attributable to the support of our operations  such as investments in information systems  expenses and office space costs for executive management  sales and marketing expenses  collection costs  financial accounting  purchasing  administrative and human resources personnel  recruiting fees  legal  auditing and other professional services 
the majority of our current sales resources are dedicated to the growing diagnostic services business 
targeting community pathology practices and hospitals  the sales process for this business group is designed to understand the customer s needs and develop appropriate solutions from our range of laboratory service options 
until the acis sale  we also had a dedicated instrument systems sales organization  which had been recently focused on assisting the dako sales team in targeting  selling and closing instrument placements in both the clinical and research markets as image analysis specialists 
diagnostic services administration includes the costs of senior medical staff  senior operations personnel  collection costs  consultants and legal resources to facilitate implementation and support the operations of the diagnostic services segment 
collection costs are incurred from a third party billing and collection company that we have engaged to perform these services due to the high degree of technical complexity and knowledge required to effectively perform these operations 
these costs are incurred as a percentage of amounts collected 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
therefore  on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to provisions for bad debts  inventory reserves and other accrued liabilities 
bad debt for estimated bad debts  we review individual accounts and groups of payers based on the age of the receivable  all circumstances surrounding the transaction that gave rise to the receivable and whether the customer or payer continues to have the financial resources to pay the receivable as of the balance sheet date and prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the related period 
this process is followed for both our instrument and laboratory accounts 
we have outsourced the direct billing and collection of laboratory related receivables and work closely with our outsourced billing partner to review the details of each laboratory account 
inventory  long lived assets and accruals for acis inventory and work in progress  the respective reserve is based upon the expected future use of the acis components and whether there are any lower of cost or market considerations 
laboratory services inventories represent primarily chemicals and supplies used in the testing process 
we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  the asset is then written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow basis 
included in long lived assets are acis units on lease to third parties under operating leases  which are recorded in property and equipment 
for other obligations requiring management s use of estimates  we review the basis for assumptions about future events and conditions  which are inherently subjective and uncertain 
in determining whether a contingent liability should be accrued  management applies standards under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a contingent liability if the exposure is considered probable and reasonably estimable 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform this test annually 
additionally  we may perform tests between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
an impairment  if any  would be recorded in loss from operations and could significantly adversely affect net loss and loss per share 
revenue recognition revenue for our diagnostic services is recognized at the time of completion of services at amounts equal to the contractual rates allowed from third parties  including medicare  insurance companies  and to a small degree  private patients 
these expected amounts are based both on medicare allowable rates and our collection experience with other third party payers 
because of the requirements and nuances of billing for laboratory services  we generally invoice amounts from a standard or customer specific agreed upon fee schedule 
differences in payments expected from third party payers and our standard fee schedule are recorded as contractual discounts 
only the expected payment from these parties  net of these contractual discounts  is recorded as revenue 
revenue for fee per use agreements is obtained through the billing information via modem  which accesses the acis database 
revenue is recognized based on the greater of actual usage fees or the minimum monthly rental fee 
under this pricing model  we own or retain a substantial risk of ownership of most of the acis instruments that are engaged in service and accordingly  all related depreciation and maintenance and service costs are expensed as incurred 
revenue for instruments that are sold  is recognized using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement eg  software license and related instrument when the basic criteria in sop no 
have been met 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which typically is a period of twelve months 
we do not recognize revenue on sales of assets subject to an operating lease where we retain a substantial risk of ownership 
systems sold under a leasing arrangement are accounted for as sales type leases pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for leases  if applicable 
we recognize the net effect of these transactions as a sale because of the bargain purchase option granted to the lessee 
we have entered into a distribution and development agreement with dako  which includes multiple elements 
those elements include distribution rights  acis instruments  research and development services  training and maintenance 
the agreement calls for an upfront payment and additional payments as instruments are delivered or milestones are achieved under the research and development component 
we are accounting for this arrangement under the percentage of completion method using the zero profit margin approach 
under this approach  revenue is recognized in amounts equal to the costs incurred to provide the products and services 
we further limit the amount of revenue recognized to the amount of fees that are fixed or determinable under the agreement 
because we do not have evidence of fair value for certain elements that span the term of the agreement  the profit earned will be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement once the research and development services are complete 
as of december   the research and development services were ongoing 
the following table presents our results of operations as percentages percentage of revenues year ended december  revenue services group technology group total revenue cost of revenue services group technology group cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative diagnostic service administration research and development total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other expense  net provision for income taxes net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue total revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for  an increase of or million 
services group 
revenue from our services group increased or million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the execution of our marketing and sales strategy to increase our sales to new customers and to enter into new managed care contracts 
this increase was also driven in part by increasing the number of available tests being performed that include immunohistochemistry  flow cytometrys and fish 
we anticipate that diagnostic services revenues will continue to increase as a result of increased revenue from existing customers  additional penetration of new customers including managed care providers by our sales force  and our offering of a more comprehensive suite of advanced cancer diagnostic tests 
technology group 
revenue from our technology group for the year ended december   including fee per use  instrument system sales and development revenue  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
the change was primarily the result of a decline in fee per use revenue of million from million to million in the comparable annual period 
revenue also decreased by million in acis units as a result of entering into the dako development and distribution agreement with a lower per system sales price 
as a result of the acis sale  we will report technology group results in discontinued operations beginning with our q for the quarter ending march  cost of revenue and gross margin for the year ended december   our gross margin was compared to in services group 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period of  an increase of 
these costs included laboratory personnel  lab related depreciation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct costs such as shipping 
gross margin for our services group for was  compared to for the increase in gross margin in was attributable to achieving economies of scale in our diagnostics laboratory operations 
we anticipate similar gross margin results for technology group 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the cost of revenue primarily consisted of the costs of manufacturing the acis  including the cost for direct material  labor  manufacturing overhead  and direct customer support 
for fee per use revenue  the cost of the acis is depreciated over three years and for a system sale or sales type lease the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of customer delivery 
gross margins for our technology group were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin was a result of lower than expected sales volume combined with the anticipated lower per system sales price as we moved to our distributor sales arrangement with dako 
revenue from dako is recognized assuming a zero profit margin  as we could not reasonably determine the fair value of an undelivered element in the contract at december  as a result of the acis sale  we will report technology group results in discontinued operations beginning with our q for the quarter ending march  operating and other expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million compared to million for as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in rent expense related to our new facility  increases in selling expenses to support the growing diagnostics services business  higher stock based compensation expense due to the implementation of sfas no 
r and relocation and recruiting expenses 
we anticipate sales expenses to support our growing diagnostics services business will continue to grow in  and expect general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues as our infrastructure costs stabilize 
diagnostic services administration 
these costs totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which included the costs of senior medical staff  senior operations personnel  collection costs  consultants and legal resources to facilitate implementation and support the operations of the diagnostic services segment 
the increase was primarily due to higher collection costs due to an increase in services group revenue  and the addition of medical and administrative staff to support this rapidly growing segment of our business 
these costs are expected to continue to increase due to higher collection costs on an anticipated continued increase in services group revenue 
research and development expenses 
expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately million or  over from million to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to personnel and consultants supporting the development activity under our agreement with dako and employees hired in conjunction with the acquisition of trestle holdings  inc  and trestle acquisition corp 
a wholly owned subsidiary of trestle holdings  inc collectively  trestle 
while development expenses are higher  we earned development fees under the terms of our distribution and development agreement with dako which are recognized in revenue 
as a result of the acis sale  we expect research and development expenses to decline substantially in interest expense and other income 
interest expense and other income for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  and primarily consisted of approximately million of net interest expense  offset by approximately million of interest income 
the increase in interest expense is due to the increased borrowings under our financing facilities and the debt guarantee fee charged by safeguard 
we expect interest expense to continue to increase as our borrowings under our financing facilities increase 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december   revenue of million was million  or higher than revenue of million for the year ended december  services group 
revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  we commenced providing these services in the second quarter of at the beginning of  the majority of tests performed in our laboratory were related to breast cancer testing and one primary cpt code although the mix of tests increased throughout to the point where approximately one half of revenue was derived from breast cancer testing by year end 
this shift has changed the average revenue per test and may continue to change in the future depending on the complexity of service associated with these new tests 
technology group 
revenue for this segment  which includes fee per use  system sale and distribution and development revenue  was million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or over the year ended december  this was due primarily to an increase in instrument systems sale revenue  which increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to the sale of acis systems as compared to acis systems in the comparable period in this improvement was offset by a decline in fee per use revenue caused by a reduction in the aggregate number of acis placements as a result of customers electing to purchase their equipment following the expiration of their lease and certain customers returning their acis equipment in order to utilize the services of our diagnostic services laboratory 
cost of revenue and gross margin for the year ended december   our gross margin was compared to for the year ended december  services group 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  these services commenced late in the second quarter of and included costs incurred to start up our services group operations 
costs were approximately of services group revenue for the current year producing a gross margin of 
these costs include the laboratory personnel  depreciation on equipment  laboratory supplies and other direct costs such as shipping that were required to support the launch and service of this operation 
technology group 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  this amount is million or less than the million cost for the year ended december  the cost of revenue primarily consists of cost for manufacturing the acis  which includes the cost for direct material  labor costs  manufacturing overhead and direct customer support costs 
for fee per use revenue  the cost of the acis is depreciated over a three year time period and for a system sale or sales type lease the entire cost of the acis system is expensed at the time of sale 
included in cost of revenue for the year ended december  was a charge of million to fully depreciate all of our access remote viewing stations because they were no longer required to facilitate the remote access web based program 
gross margins for our technology group were in as compared to in the improvement was due primarily to lower costs for systems sold  which in many cases were refurbished older systems 
the increase in gross margins was also due to lower costs of field service 
operating and other expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  to million compared to million in the decrease was due to higher expenses in the prior year from non cash compensation charges related to stock options and restricted stock  outside consulting costs for interim ceo management services and a reduction in personnel as a result of a fourth quarter workforce reduction 
these cost reductions from to were somewhat offset by higher sales and facility rental charges in diagnostic services administration 
these costs totaled million for the year ended december  and included the costs of senior medical staff  senior operations personnel  collection costs  consultants and legal resources to facilitate implementation of this new operation 
this amount is million  or higher than million for the year ended december  collection costs are incurred from a third party billing and collection company 
these costs are incurred as a percentage of amounts collected and increased as diagnostic services revenues increased 
research and development expenses 
expenses of million for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million  or  from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in personnel that resulted from our fourth quarter workforce reduction 
interest expense and other income 
interest expense and other income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and consisted of approximately million of interest expense offset by approximately million of interest income 
the interest expense is due primarily to the borrowings under our million equipment financing agreement and other equipment financing lines  which commenced in the million of interest income for the year ended december  compares to million of interest income for the comparable period of the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of lower average cash balances in the year ended december  in comparison to the comparable period of liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  due primarily to our net loss of million and the net increase in our services group accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and other working capital changes 
cash used in investing activities of million consisted of million used to fund capital expenditures related primarily to purchases of new equipment for the diagnostic services laboratory and leasehold improvements at the new facility and million used in the trestle acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million provided by our revolving lines of credit  million provided by our long term debt obligations and capital lease financing of assets previously purchased by the company  combined with million in issuance of common stock  including stock option exercises 
in june  we entered into a master lease agreement with ge capital for capital equipment financings of diagnostic services laboratory related equipment 
we financed million in  million in and million through december  of capital equipment under this arrangement  which were recorded as capital lease obligations 
each lease financing has a term of months 
the financings provide us with an early purchase option after months at of the original cost of the equipment 
the and financings provide us with an early purchase option after months for an average purchase price equal to and of the original cost of the equipment  respectively 
we believe that we have substantially all of the laboratory equipment that is required to support our current operating activities 
a substantial increase in diagnostic service activity in excess of our annual revenue plan may result in a requirement to make additional capital expenditures 
in july  we signed a ten year lease for a new facility which began december  with two five year renewal options 
we relocated our laboratory operations to the new facility in january and relocated our corporate headquarters and manufacturing operation to the new facility in the second quarter of the landlord of the new facility agreed to fund approximately million of tenant improvements  subject to the terms of the lease agreement 
our total projected spending for the build out of the facility is approximately million 
as of december   we have spent approximately million on tenant improvements and equipment purchases to build out the facility 
we expect to spend approximately million to complete the facility project 
of the million spent through december   the landlord has funded approximately million and we expect the landlord to fund the balance of approximately million as we complete the remaining tenant improvements of the new facility 
the lease for our former corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility expired in june on march   we entered into a master purchase agreement with med one pursuant to which med one purchased acis cost per test units that we previously leased to customers for a gross amount of million 
on august   med one purchased additional units for a gross amount of million 
under the agreement  of each purchase price is held in escrow and may be recoverable by med one to the extent that any units returned to med one prior to the repayment of med one s net investment in the applicable equipment lease are not successfully remarketed 
the proceeds from these financings were recorded as debt 
amounts invoiced to customers for tests performed or the minimum monthly rental fee related to the units sold to med one are recorded as revenue 
a portion of each fee is recorded as interest expense and the remainder reduces the amount recorded as debt 
we continue to record depreciation expense on the units sold to med one which is recorded to cost of revenues 
in the acis sale  the obligations under the med one agreement have been assigned to zeiss and as a result will no longer be recorded as debt in our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
on september   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of trestle 
as part of the agreement  we purchased certain assets of trestle  including high speed scanning technology  virtual systems  related intellectual property  a current product line  inventory  and manufacturing capabilities  and assumed certain liabilities of trestle 
the purchase price for the assets was approximately million in cash  including million of acquisition costs  and million of cash paid to trestle and certain of its creditors 
we financed this transaction primarily with the million of net proceeds from the equity financing with safeguard described below 
on september   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with safeguard pursuant to which safeguard purchased  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purpose of this financing was to fund the purchase of trestle  and is referred to as the trestle financing 
in exchange for safeguard s funding commitment  we also issued safeguard  warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share reflecting the trailing day average closing price of our common stock prior to june  the warrants issued in the trestle financing are exercisable for a period of four years after the issued date of september  following consummation of the trestle financing  safeguard beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in connection with this financing  we agreed to register the shares purchased by safeguard upon request by safeguard 
on september   we entered into a revolving credit facility with ge capital 
the financing arrangement consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to which we may borrow up to million  subject to adjustment 
borrowings under the credit agreement may not exceed of our qualified accounts receivable after application of certain liquidity factors and deduction of certain specified reserves  and are repaid daily by a sweep of our cash collections lockbox 
the credit agreement includes an annual collateral monitoring fee of  and the following two financial covenants one related to either a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to  or a minimum liquidity requirement of three months cash burn defined as balance sheet cash plus excess borrowing base available under the credit agreement  and one related to tangible net worth  which is required to be not less than million through june  which threshold is reduced for monthly periods to negative million at december  and thereafter 
the facility has a two year term and is secured by the diagnostic services business accounts receivable  along with all of our other assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
the interest rate under this financing arrangement is based on the lower of the london interbank offered rate libor  plus or the wall street journal published prime rate  plus 
the credit agreement provides for a prepayment fee of of the commitment amount if terminated during the first year and of the commitment amount if terminated any time thereafter prior to the maturity date 
we incurred closing costs  underwriting deposit fees  and legal fees associated with the credit agreement of  at december   we had borrowed million under this million facility  and had no availability based on the amount of our qualified accounts receivable 
in march  a portion of the proceeds from the acis sale reduced amounts outstanding to ge  and at march  we had no indebtedness outstanding and approximately million available under this facility based on our qualified accounts receivable 
we currently have a million revolving credit agreement with comerica  which was increased from million in january  and expires on february  the borrowings under the comerica facility totaling million at december   are being used for working capital purposes and a million stand by letter of credit that was provided to the landlord of our leased facility and bears interest at the bank s prime rate minus 
the comerica facility also includes an annual facility fee of  and one financial covenant related to tangible net worth  which is required to be not less than million through june  which threshold is reduced for monthly periods to negative million at december  and thereafter 
borrowings under the comerica facility are guaranteed by safeguard in exchange for an annual fee of of the amount guaranteed and an amount equal to per annum of the daily weighted average principal balance outstanding 
additionally  we are required to pay safeguard a quarterly usage fee of of the amount by which the daily average principal balance exceeds million 
we also issued warrants to safeguard as consideration for their guarantee as follows warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for an exercise price of per share for safeguard s guarantee of million  warrants to purchase  shares for an exercise price of as a commitment fee for safeguard s guarantee of the million increase in the line  and warrants to purchase  shares for an exercise price of as a maintenance fee for safeguard s guarantee of the million increase in the line 
the fair value of warrants issued  determined under the black scholes model  is recognized as expense over the applicable period of the commitment 
on march   we obtained a subordinated revolving credit line the mezzanine facility from a safeguard affiliate 
the mezzanine facility  which expires december   provides us access to up to million in working capital funding as we continue to grow our business 
the mezzanine facility was originally million  but was reduced by million as a result of the acis sale 
borrowings on the mezzanine facility will bear interest at an annual rate of 
in connection with the mezzanine facility  we issued or are required to issue to safeguard warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  expiring march   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share reflecting a discount to the trailing day average closing price of our common stock prior to march   expiring march   and four year warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock for each  borrowed with a minimum draw amount of million 
to date  no amounts have been drawn on the line 
we believe that our existing cash resources  including the cash proceeds from the acis sale and anticipated revenues from our laboratory services business  together with access to the financing sources described above  will be sufficient to satisfy the cash needs of our existing operations throughout however  we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations  and future profitability is uncertain 
if we are unable to achieve positive cash flow  we may fail to comply with one or more of our debt covenants  which may accelerate our outstanding indebtedness 
moreover  if we are unable to access one or more of these financing sources  or if we encounter other difficulties in executing our business plan  we may require additional financing 
additionally  if we reach a decision to acquire or license complementary technology or acquire complementary businesses  we would require additional debt or equity financing  or would be required to monetize other assets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing when needed or on terms that are favorable to us and our stockholders 
furthermore  if additional funds are raised through an equity or convertible debt financing  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   including our operating facility lease and capital lease obligations 
these commitments exclude any remaining amounts necessary to complete the build out of our new facility and a million standby letter of credit provided to the landlord under the lease agreement for our facility 
payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands revolving lines of credit long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases total off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or involve leasing  hedging or research and development services for our business or other similar arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly reflected in the financial statements  except for facilities operating leases 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements several new accounting standards have been issued and adopted recently 
none of these standards had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach  as those terms are defined in sab the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year statement of operations  whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origin 
financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
if a company determines that an adjustment to prior year financial statements is required upon adoption of sab and does not elect to restate its previous financial statements  then it must recognize the cumulative effect of applying sab in fiscal beginning balances of the affected assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the fiscal opening balance in retained earnings 
sab is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas no 
applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except sfas no 
r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in short term debt securities that are intended to be held to maturity 
these short term investments typically have various maturity dates which do not exceed one year 
we had no short term investments as of december  as a result of the acis sale  we expect to invest in short term debt securities in two of the main risks associated with these investments are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of debt securities 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements because of the short term nature of the securities in which we invest and our intention to hold the securities to maturity 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the debt securities will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
we have limited the investments to investment grade or comparable securities and have not experienced any losses on our investments to date due to credit risk
