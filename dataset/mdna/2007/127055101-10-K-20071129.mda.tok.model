item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cabot s strategy focuses on optimizing our core businesses and product lines rubber blacks  performance products  fumed metal oxides and the supermetals business and investing the cash and intellectual resources they generate in new businesses and product lines inkjet colorants  aerogel  the specialty fluids business and superior micropowders 
drivers of demand and key factors impacting our profitability differ by business and product line 
demand for carbon black is driven primarily by vehicle miles driven and general economic conditions that influence the consumption of products that are produced using carbon black 
regional demand is influenced by shifts in demand from mature to emerging markets 
rubber blacks and performance products results have been driven by changes in raw material costs  by our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in raw material costs and by global and regional capacity utilization 
inkjet colorants demand and results have been driven by a relative increase of printer platforms using our pigments at both new and existing oem customers and by the inkjet printer cartridge aftermarket 
over the past several years advances in inkjet technology  including printheads and high efficiency colorants  have enabled inkjet cartridge manufacturers to achieve similar print quality with less ink  leading to a decreased demand for inkjet pigments 
demand for fumed metal oxides is largely driven by the construction  automotive and electronics industries  by general consumer product growth and by increasing demand for our products in emerging markets 
fumed metal oxides results have been driven by our traditional silicones and electronics market segments  by growth in emerging markets and by global fumed silica capacity utilization 
in the supermetals business  demand for tantalum is largely driven by the number of electronic devices produced using tantalum capacitors versus competing materials 
over the past several years capacitors have been made using high efficiency powders that require a lower volume of tantalum powder to achieve the same capacitance 
since  sales in the supermetals business have been transitioning from principally those under fixed price  fixed volume contracts to market based arrangements 
this transition was completed in december in fiscal year  sales under these fixed price contracts accounted for of sales in the supermetals business  this compares to in and in profitability for the business has largely been determined by the pricing and volume commitments under these supply contracts  by our ability to replace contracted volumes with market based sales  by the cost of ore under our long term raw materials supply contract and by our ability to implement cost reduction initiatives 
cesium formate demand is primarily driven by the level of drilling of high pressure oil and gas wells and by the petroleum industry s acceptance of our product as a drilling and completion fluid for this application 
results in the specialty fluids business have been driven by the size and type of jobs  by the percentage of our total available fluid being utilized in any given period in our principal north sea market and by our ability to expand the usage of our fluids outside of the north sea 
aerogel and superior micropowders are both in early formative stages and do not currently generate material revenue 
during  our carbon black business experienced solid volume growth in rubber blacks and performance products  but was unfavorably impacted by significant weakness in the inkjet colorants aftermarket market segment 
this volume increase coupled with the positive impact of pricing relative to our raw material costs increased profitability 
in the metal oxides business  our fumed metal oxides product line experienced solid volume growth and high plant utilization  including the benefit of operating our fumed silica plant in china  which commenced operations in the second half of these factors coupled with a reduction in the unfavorable earnings impact from our aerogel product line led the business to significant increases in profitability 
the supermetals business was unfavorably impacted by lower prices and volumes during the year and by higher raw material costs under our long term tantalum ore supply contract 
during the year  however  this business continued to reduce its inventory levels  generating million of cash 
in the specialty fluids business  increased drilling activity  particularly in the north 
table of contents sea  resulted in higher fluid utilization and increased profitability 
we also expanded our geographic reach  increasing the number of wells using our fluid outside of the north sea 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we derive most of our revenues from the sale of rubber blacks  performance products  fumed metal oxides  tantalum and related products and from the rental and sale of cesium formate 
revenue from product sales is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenue from the rental of cesium formate is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 
other operating revenues  which represents less than ten percent of total revenues  include tolling  servicing and royalties for licensed technology 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
if we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment  the revenue is deferred until product acceptance has occurred 
certain customer contracts contain price protection clauses that provide for the potential reduction in past or future sales prices 
we analyze these contract provisions to determine if an obligation related to these clauses exists and record revenue net of any estimated price protection commitments 
we offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives 
the discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience 
rebates are estimated and recorded based primarily on historical experience and contractual obligations 
we review the estimates for discounts and volume rebates  and the assumptions underlying the estimates are modified to reflect changes in facts and circumstances as appropriate 
this estimation process introduces some uncertainty as to the amount of revenue we recognize 
refinements to the initial estimates can result in increases or decreases to revenue and thus directly impact our earnings and cash flows 
such changes in our estimates have historically not been material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of our accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis 
additionally  we estimate sales returns based on historical trends in our customers product returns 
while bad debt write offs and product returns have not been significant historically  if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness  actual defaults are higher than our previous experience or actual returns do not reflect historical trends  our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us and our sales would be adversely affected  which may reduce our earnings 

table of contents inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo inventory method 
had we used the first in  first out fifo inventory method instead of the lifo method for such inventories  the value of those inventories would have been million and million higher as of september  and  respectively 
the cost of other us and all us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in periods of rapidly rising or declining prices  the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability 
for example  the significant increase in oil prices recently caused our reported cost of sales in our carbon black business to be higher than they would have been had we used a different inventory valuation method 
under our current lifo method  when raw material costs are rising  our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to cost of sales 
if  however  we were using a fifo method  our purchases from days ago  which were at lower prices  would instead be the first charged to cost of sales 
the opposite result occurs should there be a rapid decline in prices 
we review inventory for potential obsolescence recoverability periodically 
in this review  we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete  unmarketable or slow moving inventory 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unsaleable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in cases where the market value of inventories is below cost  the inventory is adjusted to its market value 
historically  such write downs have not been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings 
stock based compensation since october   we have followed the methodology set forth in fas no 
share based payments fas r  using the modified prospective approach to account for all of our stock based awards 
historically  we have issued significantly more shares of restricted stock than stock options under our equity compensation plans 
restricted stock awards  whether accounted for under fas r or the previous standard  accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  generally result in a charge to the consolidated statement of operations 
accordingly  the impact of fas r on our comparative results over a period of years is not significant 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on intrinsic value at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity compensation plans 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we make a variety of assumptions and estimates  including discount rates  forfeiture rates  volatility measures  expected yields and expected option lives 
changes to such assumptions and estimates can result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings 
such changes would not impact our cash flows 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment test for goodwill at least annually and when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test whether an impairment exists  the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is estimated based on discounted future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value is sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows are based on management s best estimates about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  future growth rates  capital expenditures and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the 
table of contents risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill to its implied fair value is recorded 
while this would have no direct impact on our cash flows  it would reduce our earnings 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily include property  plant  equipment  long term investments and assets held for rent 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used  a decline in the physical condition of the asset or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
we make various estimates and assumptions when analyzing whether there is an impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and long term investments 
these estimates and assumptions include determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life of the asset over which the cash flows will occur  their amounts and the asset s residual value  if any 
an asset impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset 
the impairment loss is determined by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our estimated future cash flows reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset 
while an impairment charge would have no direct impact on our cash flows  it would reduce our earnings 
the fair values of long term investments are dependent on the financial performance of the entities in which we invest and the external factors inherent in the markets in which these entities operate 
we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investment entities when assessing the potential impairment of these investments 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments 
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate fair value  with the exception of certain long term debt that has not been designated with a fair value hedge 
this portion of long term debt is recorded at face value 
the fair values of our derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes nor do we hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in either earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if designated as part of a hedge transaction  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes 
although these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
we record in earnings the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges 

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans where applicable and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
the most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets 
assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied  they include estimated discount rates  rates of compensation increases for employees  mortality  employee turnover and other related demographic data 
projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends 
we compute our recorded obligations globally in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
under such principles  if actual results differ from what is projected  the differences are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
however  cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
self insurance reserves we are partially self insured for certain third party liability  workers compensation and employee health benefits in the united states and canada 
the third party and workers compensation liabilities are managed through a wholly owned insurance captive and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
we have accrued amounts equal to the actuarially determined liabilities 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal actions  medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and impact our earnings and cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas  and interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
pursuant to fas  companies are required to estimate incremental costs for special handling  removal and disposal costs of materials that may or will give rise to conditional asset retirement obligations aros and then discount the expected costs back to the current year using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
fin clarified that aro liabilities and costs must be recognized when the timing and or settlement can be reasonably estimated 
if it is unclear when  or if  an aro will be triggered  companies are required to use probability weightings for possible timing scenarios to determine the amounts that should be recognized in their financial statements 
the estimation of aros is subject to a number of inherent uncertainties including a the timing of when any aro may be incurred  b the ability to accurately identify and reasonably estimate the costs of all materials that may require special handling or treatment  c the ability to assess the relative probability of different scenarios that could give rise to an aro  and d other factors outside a company s control  including changes in regulations  costs and interest rates 
aros have not been recognized for certain of our facilities because either the present value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable facility life or we do not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities 
in most circumstances where aros have been recorded  the anticipated cash outflows will likely take place far into the future 
accordingly  actual costs and the timing of such costs may vary significantly from our estimates  which may  in turn  impact our earnings 
in general  however  when such estimates change  the impact is spread over future years and thus the impact on any individual year is unlikely to be material 

table of contents litigation and contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
after consultation with counsel  as appropriate  we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute  and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows 
the most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
the amount accrued reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites  the nature of the remedies  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of an estimated discount rate and estimates of future cash flows associated with the liability 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 
our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending silica and non malignant asbestos claims  iii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iv significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  v changes in the nature of claims received  vi changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vii the financial viability of other parties who contribute to the settlement of respirator claims  viii a change in the availability of american optical s insurance coverage  and ix a determination that our interpretation of the contractual obligations on which we have estimated our share of liability is inaccurate 
while we believe the current best estimate is recorded  we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
additionally  if the timing of actual payments made for environmental remediation or respirator claims differs significantly from our estimated payment schedules  and we could no longer reasonably predict the timing of such payments  we could then be required to record the reserve amounts on an undiscounted basis on our consolidated balance sheets  causing an immediate impact to our earnings 
income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
where appropriate  we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for contingencies fas and fas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
for example  a change in our effective tax rate would change income tax expense for the fiscal year ended september  by approximately million 

table of contents additionally  in accordance with fas we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time 
we review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets 
an increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense  lower stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees that are based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to abandon certain facilities and asset impairments as discussed above under valuation of long lived assets 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or if new information comes to our attention  which would then be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which will be fiscal for us 
we are evaluating the impact of fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value measures  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect fair value measurements have on earnings 
the primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures are valuing pension plan assets and liabilities  valuing hedge related derivative financial instruments  allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  and evaluating long term assets for potential impairment 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for us beginning october  we are evaluating the impact of fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
table of contents fas 
fas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation  in its consolidated balance sheets 
fas also requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end 
as of september   we adopted the balance sheet impact of reflecting the funded status of our plan using the current june measurement date 
as required by fas  on or before september   we will change our measurement date to our september year end rather than the current june measurement date 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of the change in measurement date related to the second part of fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return  including a decision whether or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
under this new guidance  the consolidated financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts  but without considering the time value of money 
this guidance also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive annual  tabular roll forward of unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for annual periods beginning after december   which will be fiscal for us 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements  however a preliminary evaluation indicates that we will record an additional liability in the range of million to million through the consolidated statements of stockholders equity in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations cabot is organized into four reportable segments the carbon black business  the metal oxides business  the supermetals business  and the specialty fluids business 
the carbon black business is comprised of the rubber blacks  performance products and inkjet colorants product lines as well as the business development activities of cabot superior micropowders csmp 
the metal oxides business is comprised of the fumed metal oxides and aerogel product lines 
our analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september fiscal year compared to fiscal years and consolidated net sales and gross profit years ended september dollars in millions net sales gross profit the million increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to higher volumes million and the positive effect of foreign currency translation on our selling prices million  principally resulting from the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
these factors were partially offset by lower pricing million  principally resulting from the feedstock related pricing mechanism in our rubber blacks contracts and the transition from contracted to market based sales in the supermetals business 
additionally  we had million of revenue related to our transportation of a third party s cargo in that did not reoccur in in  the million increase in sales compared to was primarily due to higher volumes million  higher pricing  principally to keep pace with rising carbon black feedstock costs million  and the favorable impact of consolidating the results of cabot japan million 

table of contents our gross profit margin was in  in and in gross profit increased in as the impact of higher volumes and lower relative raw material costs more than offset lower pricing 
gross profit decreased in compared to primarily due to higher raw material costs and a million payment made to the sons of gwalia 
these factors were partially offset by higher prices from feedstock related price increases in rubber blacks and performance products 
selling and administrative expense years ended september dollars in millions selling and administrative expense the million increase in selling and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to payments associated with settlements of certain carbon black antitrust litigation million  which were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as selling and administrative expense  and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
the million decrease in expense in compared to was primarily due to lower administrative costs  principally in our supermetals business  and a reduction of costs associated with the implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of these savings were partially offset by increased spending on initiatives aimed at standardizing our transactional processes and administering certain functional activities through a shared services model 
research and technical expense years ended september dollars in millions research and technical expense the million increase in research and technical expense in compared to is due primarily to increased spending associated with new business development opportunities million combined  including i investments in the development of pigments to serve the high speed inkjet market  ii the development activities of csmp  and iii increased spending in our rubber blacks and performance products product lines 
in addition  research and technical expense in includes the acquisition of million of in process research and development technology in the supermetals business 
the million decrease in compared to was primarily due to reduced research and technical spending in the supermetals business partially offset by increased spending for csmp 
interest and dividend income years ended september dollars in millions interest and dividend income interest and dividend income increased by million in when compared to due primarily to higher cash balances available for interest earning investments 
interest and dividend income decreased by million in compared to due to lower cash available for interest earning investments  primarily in the first half of  and the liquidation of marketable securities in the first quarter of 
table of contents interest expense years ended september dollars in millions interest expense interest expense increased by million in compared to primarily driven by a reduction in capitalized interest on capital projects in approximately million  the effect of the appreciation of the euro approximately million and an increase in our debt level during the year approximately million  principally to fund working capital requirements in china 
the million decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to the repayment of debt in the us that matured in december  and to the capitalization of interest related to the construction of our new facilities in china and the expansion of our existing carbon black facility in brazil 
other income charges years ended september dollars in millions other income charges the million increase in other income was primarily due to foreign currency translation gains of approximately million 
the million decrease in other income in was primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses  including a charge of million for the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments related to the substantial liquidation of the legal entity through which we had conducted carbon black operations in altona  australia 
benefit provision for income taxes years ended september dollars in millions benefit provision for income taxes tax rate on income loss from continuing operations the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in an overall tax rate on income from continuing operations 
excluding million in tax benefits resulting from the settlement of various tax audits  our tax rate would have been approximately for fiscal our tax rate varies from the us statutory rate of for a variety of reasons 
for example  our legal entity structure provided us with a benefit of approximately million or from the us statutory rate owing primarily to the recognition of income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
in addition  we benefited from approximately million or of research and experimentation credits 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in an overall tax rate on income from continuing operations 
excluding million in tax benefits resulting from the settlement of various tax audits  million in tax benefit from the permanent reinvestment of prior year earnings of a non us subsidiary  and an million translation charge for the substantial liquidation of our australian entity that was not tax benefited  our tax rate would have been approximately

the benefit for income taxes was million for fiscal  resulting in a overall tax rate on loss from continuing operations 
excluding the million tax settlement in the fourth quarter and the million goodwill impairment and million long lived asset impairment charges related to the supermetals business in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  our tax rate would have been approximately for fiscal our legal entity structure decreased the amount of tax expense from the us statutory rate by approximately million or 
in addition  we recorded tax benefits of million or for us research and experimentation credits and export incentives 

table of contents in the normal course of business  the tax filings of cabot and its subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
the irs is currently examining our and tax years 
we have filed our tax returns in accordance with the tax laws in each jurisdiction and maintain tax reserves for differences between tax obligations as reflected in our tax filings and potential final tax obligations for exposures that can be reasonably estimated 
if actual results are significantly different from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be significantly impacted 
in addition  certain cabot subsidiaries are under audit in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us it is possible that some of these audits will be resolved in fiscal which may impact our tax rate in the periods during which these settlements occur 
we expect our tax rate that which reflects our fundamental tax structure for fiscal to be between and  before the results of several ongoing audits 
equity in net income of affiliates our share of earnings from equity affiliates was million in fiscal  and  as increased earnings from our affiliates in mexico  venezuela and malaysia have offset the equity earnings of cabot japan  which is now consolidated 
in november we began consolidating the results of cabot japan as a wholly owned entity as a result of acquiring our joint venture partner s  showa denko kk s  interest in that entity 
discontinued operations in fiscal  we recorded income from discontinued operations of million per diluted common share  which included tax benefits of million relating to legal and tax settlements  offset by a charge of less than million for legal settlements 
during fiscal  we recorded income of million per diluted common share relating to favorable tax settlements 
we did not record income or charges related to discontinued operations in net income loss we reported net income for of million per diluted common share compared to net income of million per diluted common share in and a net loss of million a loss of per common share in fiscal year compared to fiscal years and by business segment the following discussion of our results includes information on our reportable segment sales and operating profit before taxes pbt

product line sales summary the following table sets forth sales by product line for the carbon black business for fiscal years  and years ended september dollars in millions rubber blacks performance products inkjet colorants csmp total carbon black business sales rubber blacks volumes grew by during due principally to growth in china and other emerging markets more than offsetting weakness in the north american region 
during the year we announced our intention to close our waverly  west virginia carbon black manufacturing plant as a result of declining demand driven by weakness in the north american tire industry 
during performance in the business improved due to strong volumes  the impact of previously announced cost reduction efforts and increased prices on our non contracted business 
despite a feedstock related benefit in the first half of the fiscal year  the time lag of the feedstock related pricing mechanism on our contracted business negatively impacted performance during the second half of the year 
during strong volumes and price increases in both our contracted and non contracted business offset higher feedstock and natural gas costs allowing us to maintain relatively stable unit margins 
additionally  the results of cabot japan had a positive impact on the product line in in order to adjust for changes in feedstock costs and maintain margins over time  we have pricing formulas in our annual and long term supply contracts 
most of our contracts provide for a price adjustment on the first day of each quarter to account for changes in feedstock costs and  in some cases  changes in other relevant costs 
the feedstock adjustments are calculated in the month prior to the beginning of the three month period in which the price change is effective  and typically are based upon the average of a relevant index over the prior three month period 
because of these provisions  there is a lag between the time when we incur raw material costs and the time when changes in those costs are reflected in the contract pricing 
in periods of volatility in feedstock costs  this lag can cause fluctuations in our financial results  as has been the case over the past few years 

table of contents performance products in  volumes increased by compared to due to strong demand 
the performance of the product line was favorably impacted by price increases during the year in the face of rising feedstock costs 
during  volumes decreased by primarily due to a decline in volume in our lower margin  non contracted business resulting from price increases we implemented to respond to rising raw material costs 
the profitability of the product line was negatively impacted by higher raw material and energy costs and by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation adjustments 
during fiscal  we completed the construction of a performance products manufacturing unit at our plant in tianjin  china with a nameplate capacity of approximately  metric tons 
the unit became operational in september inkjet colorants inkjet colorants volumes declined by in compared to the product line experienced increased demand in the oem segment of the small office  home office soho market and in the high speed market segment 
these increases were not enough  however  to offset significant weakness in the aftermarket segment of the soho market 
the aftermarket has been unfavorably impacted by aggressive competition from the oem cartridge manufacturers and by improved ink efficiencies  which has led to the use of less ink per cartridge  depressing demand 
volumes for increased by when compared to  with growth in both the oem and aftermarket segments 
the favorable impact of volume increases was partially offset by a decrease in our average selling price due to the continued shift from experimental stage pricing levels to prices more consistent with commercial sales and some lower selling prices as the business matures 
additionally  higher fixed costs resulting from new production capacity that was not fully commercially utilized unfavorably impacted the product line during both the second half of and the first half of during fiscal  we completed the debottlenecking of our manufacturing unit for the production of colorants to serve the high speed inkjet market 
the capacity became operational in the fourth quarter of superior micropowders during fiscal  we continued to make progress on various new business development opportunities particularly in the security inks  catalyst and fuel cell areas 
the decrease in sales in csmp from through was due to a transition from government sponsored work to commercial sales 
outlook for we anticipate carbon black demand to remain strong in all regions outside of north america  where we remain concerned about lower rubber blacks demand because of continued weakness in the tire industry 
we also expect continued strong demand in our performance products product line supported by added volume from our new capacity in china 
we are cautious with regard to the impact of rising raw material costs on our rubber blacks and performance products product lines 
in the inkjet colorants product line  we believe that there will be an eventual recovery in the aftermarket segment  although the timing and magnitude of such a recovery are uncertain 
we anticipate continued volume growth for our products that serve the high speed market segment  although we continue to expect growth in this developing market to be slow at first

during  the fumed metal oxides product line saw a increase in overall volumes driven by growth in the electronics and niche market segments  which more than offset a decline in volumes in the silicones market segment 
this volume growth and strong plant utilization more than offset higher hydrogen and natural gas costs during the year 
aerogel during the first fiscal quarter of we temporarily ceased production at our semi works facility in frankfurt  germany in an effort to reduce costs and inventory levels

table of contents outlook for going forward into  sales in the supermetals business will no longer benefit from our fixed price and volume supply contracts 
the market for tantalum products faces volatility in the coming year due  in part  to ownership changes of both our largest competitor and the largest supplier of raw materials in the industry 
we are experiencing an increasingly competitive marketplace  which could unfavorably impact profitability

while such increased costs are generally recovered through higher selling prices  there is a period of several months between when cash is paid for inventory purchases and when it is received for subsequent sales 
this can lead to temporary uses of working capital 
cash and marketable securities we have had no material losses on our cash and marketable securities investments during fiscal  and our september  balances correctly reflect the market value of our investments 
we have given consideration to the turbulent credit markets in making this assessment 
repatriation of foreign currency as of september   we had cash at a venezuelan subsidiary of approximately million which has been translated at the official exchange rate 
we continue to be concerned about our ability to repatriate this cash as we have not received approval to formally exchange this cash at the official rate 
if we are unable to repatriate this cash at the official exchange rate or if the official exchange rate devalues  we may incur additional reductions to our earnings and cash balances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through long and short term borrowings and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies 
changes in these rates and prices may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 

table of contents we have policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all of the derivative instruments we enter into are reviewed and approved by our financial risk management committee  an internal management committee responsible for overseeing cabot s financial risk management policy 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by a quoted market price and reflects the asset or liability position as of september  if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a payment risk for cabot 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
interest rate risk as of september   we had long term debt  including the current portion  totaling million  which has both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge of the underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we endeavor to maintain a certain fixed to floating interest rate mix on our long term debt 
as most of our long term debt was issued at fixed rates  we use interest rate swaps to achieve the desired fixed to floating interest rate mix 
additionally  in certain regions where we have stable cash flows and low interest rates relative to the incremental corporate borrowing rate  we generally lock in a fixed interest rate on our debt in that region 
this has been achieved by entering into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements

in general  we endeavor to match the currency in which we issue debt to the currency of our major  stable cash receipts 
in some situations we have issued debt denominated in us dollars and then entered into cross currency swaps that exchange our dollar principal and interest payments into a currency where we expect long term  stable cash receipts 
in one case  we have borrowed against our revolving credit facility in japanese yen 
this debt is designated as a net investment hedge to offset currency fluctuations associated with the investments we have made in our japanese subsidiaries

accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
these forward contracts typically have a duration of days 
in and  none of our forward contracts were designated as fas hedging instruments 
as of september   we had million in net foreign currency forward contracts  which were denominated in japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  and australian dollar 
in certain situations where we have a long term commitment denominated in a foreign currency we may enter into appropriate financial instruments in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge future cash flow exposures
