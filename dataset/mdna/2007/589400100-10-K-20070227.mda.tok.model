at year end  approximately of the company s total investment portfolio  at market values  and of its total fixed maturity investments  at market values  were invested in investment grade tax exempt revenue and municipal bonds 
shorter duration sinking fund preferred stocks and collateralized mortgage obligations represented a combined of the company s total investment portfolio  at market values  at december  the average standard poor s rating of the company s bond holdings was aa at december  holdings of lower than investment grade bonds constitute approximately of total invested assets  at market values 
the nominal average maturity of the overall bond portfolio  including collateralized mortgage obligations and short term cash investments  was years at december   which reflects a heavy portfolio mix in investment grade tax exempt revenue and municipal bonds 
the call adjusted average maturity of the overall bond portfolio was approximately years  related to holdings which are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified duration of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years at december   including collateralized mortgage obligations with modified durations of approximately years and short term cash investments that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms  which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
the longer the duration  the greater the price volatility in relation to changes in interest rates 
equity holdings consist of perpetual preferred stocks and dividend bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend exclusion 
at year end  short term cash investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis

includes investment write downs  net of tax benefit  that the company considered to be other than temporary of million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in competitive conditions the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and consists of a large number of multi state competitors  offering automobile  homeowners  commercial property insurance  and other lines 
many of the company s competitors have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources than those of the company 
based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written in  the company was the third largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in california and the fourteenth largest in the united states 
competitors with greater market share in california sell insurance through exclusive agents  rather than through independent agents and brokers 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity soft market 
in management s view  through was a period of very good results for companies underwriting automobile insurance  which has now created a soft market 
however  the company has observed that many competitors are decreasing the rates they charge customers for insurance 
the company expects that these rate decreases coupled with loss inflation could lead to a hard market within the next months 
reputation for service and price are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
the company believes that it has a good reputation for service  and it has historically been among the lowest priced insurers doing business in california according to surveys conducted by the california doi 
in addition  the marketing efforts of independent agents and brokers can also provide a competitive advantage 
all rates charged by private passenger automobile insurers in california are subject to the prior approval of the california doi 
see regulation automobile insurance rating factor regulations 
the company encounters similar competition in each state outside california and line of business in which it operates 
reinsurance the company has reinsurance through the florida hurricane catastrophe trust fund fhcf that provides coverage equal to approximately percent of million in excess of million per occurrence based on the latest information provided by fhcf 
the coverage is expected to change when new information is available later in prior to april   the company maintained catastrophe reinsurance on florida and georgia property policies equal to percent of million in excess of million of losses per occurrence 
this reinsurance was placed with domestic and non domestic reinsurers and several lloyds syndicates and was not renewed effective april  the commercial property and homeowners reinsurance treaty that provided reinsurance for losses in excess of  up to million total loss per incident was not renewed effective january  prior to january  the company had reinsurance for commercial property and homeowner policies for losses in excess of  up to million total loss per incident 
for california homeowners policies  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes due to the placement of earthquake risks with the california earthquake authority 
see regulation california earthquake authority 
although the company s catastrophe exposure to earthquakes has been reduced  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure for fire following an earthquake 
prior to january  ami had working layer reinsurance treaties for property and casualty losses in excess of  up to million  which was not renewed at january  the company continues to carry a commercial umbrella reinsurance treaty and seek facultative arrangements for large property risks 
the company has other reinsurance in force that is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
if any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty  the company will be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its insureds in their entirety 
regulation the company s business in the states in which it operates is subject to significant regulation and supervision by the doi of each state  each of which has broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers 
california department of insurance oversight the powers of the california doi primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors  the establishment of capital and surplus requirements and solvency standards  and restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
california doi regulations and supervision are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders rather than shareholders 
the california doi is also responsible for conducting periodic financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in california 
the california doi s market conduct division is responsible for conducting periodic examinations of companies to ensure compliance with the california insurance code and the california code of regulations with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
in february  the california doi issued a notice of non compliance nnc alleging that the company willfully misrepresented the actual price consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a one time fee charged by the consumer s insurance broker 
the company filed a notice of defense in response to the nnc 
the company does not believe that it has done anything to warrant a monetary penalty from the california doi 
the san francisco superior court  in krumme v 
mercury insurance company  denied plaintiff s requests for restitution or any other form of retrospective monetary relief based on the same facts and legal theory 
if a monetary penalty is imposed by the california doi  the company is unable to estimate the monetary penalty and therefore  no reserve for the potential monetary penalty has been established in the consolidated financial statements 
the matter is currently in discovery and a hearing before the administrative law judge has been scheduled for september state insurance agency oversight in other states the insurance companies outside california are subject to the regulatory powers of the dois of the various states in which they operate 
those regulatory powers are similar to those of california enumerated above 
insurance rates in georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada require prior approval from the state doi  while insurance rates in illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan must only be filed with the respective doi before they are implemented 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the doi in each state in which the company operates conducts periodic financial examinations of the company s insurance subsidiaries domiciled within the respective state 
the georgia doi is conducting a financial examination of the company s georgia insurance subsidiaries for the period january  through december  the report for this examination is not yet available 
in addition to the financial examinations  the doi in each state conducts market conduct examinations of the company s compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating  underwriting  claims handling  billing and other practices 
the florida doi has conducted a market conduct examination of mercury select management company  inc for the period january  through december  the report for this examination  received in november  noted no deficiencies 
the virginia doi commenced a market conduct examination of mercury casualty company in january for the period of january  through june  the report for this examination is not yet available 
the operations of the company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the company 
the company retains its own legislative advocates in california 
the company made financial contributions of  and  to officeholders and candidates in and  respectively 
the company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate 
insurance assessments the california insurance guarantee association ciga was created to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which cannot be paid out of such insurers assets 
the company is subject to assessment by ciga for its pro rata share of such claims based on premiums written in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in california 
such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer 
in a particular year  the company cannot be assessed an amount greater than of its premiums written in the preceding year 
these assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
insurance subsidiaries in the other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
during  the company paid approximately million in assessments to the new jersey unsatisfied claim and judgment fund and the new jersey property liability insurance guaranty association for assessments relating to its personal automobile line of business 
in addition  the company accrued approximately million for the florida citizens property insurance corporation and paid and accrued approximately million for the florida insurance guaranty association for assessments relating to its homeowners line of business 
as permitted by state law  approximately million of the new jersey assessment and the majority of the florida assessments are recoupable through a surcharge to policyholders 
during  the company began to recoup these assessments and will continue recouping them in it is possible that there will be additional assessments in holding company act the california companies are subject to regulation by the california doi pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
certain transactions and dividends defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be effected if the california doi disapproves the transaction within days after notice 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  extraordinary dividends  management agreements  service contracts  and cost sharing arrangements  all guarantees that are not quantifiable  derivative transactions or series of derivative transactions  certain reinsurance transactions or modifications thereof in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer s liabilities equals or exceeds percent of the insurer s policyholder s surplus  as of the preceding december  sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  and investments  in the net aggregate  involving more than the lesser of of the respective california company s admitted assets or of statutory surplus as regards policyholders  as of the preceding december an extraordinary dividend is a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the california doi 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the california doi an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
each of the insurance companies is subject to holding company regulations in the states in which it is domiciled  the provisions of which are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 
assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bodily injury liability  property damage liability  medical expense and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
in  assigned risks represented of total automobile direct premiums written and of total automobile direct premium earned 
the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
many of the other states in which the company conducts business offer programs similar to that of california 
these programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states 
automobile insurance rating factor regulations california proposition requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the california doi prior to their use  and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and are adopted by regulation 
the statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the company s rate plan was approved by the california doi and operates under these rating factor regulations 
on july   the california office of administrative law approved proposed regulations by the california doi that effectively reduce the weight that insurers can place on a person s residence when establishing automobile insurance rates 
insurance companies in california are now required to file rating plans with the california doi that comply with the new regulations 
there is a two year phase in period for insurers to fully implement those plans 
as such  the company made a rate filing in august that reduced the territorial impact of its rates and requested a small overall rate increase 
additional rate filings will be required during the two year phase in period 
the doi has not yet approved the august filing  nor is there any assurance that it will 
in general  the company expects that the regulations will cause rates for urban drivers to decrease and those for non urban drivers to increase 
these rate changes are likely to increase consumer shopping for insurance which could affect the volume and the retention rates of the company s business 
it is the company s intention to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace while complying with the new regulations 
on april   new regulations governing the approval of property and casualty insurance rates will become effective in california 
these regulations generally tighten the existing proposition prior approval ratemaking regime primarily by establishing a maximum allowable rate of return of just below percent the average of short  intermediate and long term t bill rates  plus percent and a minimum allowable rate of return of negative percent of surplus 
however  the practical impact of these limitations is unclear because the california doi has yet to promulgate input values for surplus standards by line  efficiency standards  and reserve ratios 
in addition  the new regulations allow for the california doi to grant a number of variances based on service  loss prevention  business mix  service to underserved communities  and other factors 
the company anticipates the new regulations will be challenged in the courts either before their effective date or with their first application 
on january   the florida financial services commission approved new regulations requiring insurers to submit information to the florida office of insurance regulation oir regarding the use of credit reports and credit scores in establishing rules  rates or underwriting guidelines 
under the regulations  any insurer that uses credit scores or credit reports in filing a new rule  rate or underwriting guideline will be required to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that its credit scoring methodology does not disproportionately affect persons of any particular race  color  religion  marital status  age  gender  income level or place of residence 
the regulations were challenged by several insurance industry trade associations and were recently struck down by a florida administrative law judge  and hence  there is no near term compliance deadline 
it is uncertain if and how the oir intends to continue to pursue this change in the law 
the company intends to maintain its competitive position in the florida marketplace while complying with the new regulations if they are implemented 
in the january special session of the florida legislature  a bill designed to improve the availability and affordability of property insurance in florida was passed and subsequently signed by the governor 
among the significant provisions in the new law is a requirement that all companies that write private passenger automobile policies in florida also write homeowners policies in florida if they write homeowners policies in any other state 
the law also expands the availability of reinsurance through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  requires rate filings to reflect savings from the availability of such reinsurance  includes homeowners insurance under florida s existing excess profits regulations  and requires insurers to offer discounts for various deductible options and hurricane mitigation measures 
the company is closely monitoring the development of the regulations related to this new law  which are expected to become effective in the spring of the company is not able to determine the impact of any of the legal and regulatory changes described in the four paragraphs above 
however  it is possible that the impact could adversely affect the company and its results from operations 
california financial responsibility law california requires proof of insurance for new or renewal motor vehicle registration 
it also provides for substantial penalties for failure to supply proof of insurance if a driver is stopped for a traffic violation 
in addition  california provides that injured uninsured drivers are only able to recover actual  out of pocket medical expenses and lost wages and are not entitled to receive awards for general damages such as pain and suffering 
this restriction also applies to drunk drivers and fleeing felons 
the law has helped control loss costs 
california earthquake authority the california earthquake authority cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
since  the company has placed all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the cea 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most recent information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at june   was approximately million 
terrorism risk insurance act of the federal government enacted the terrorism risk insurance act of the act to establish a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from acts of terrorism  as defined within the act 
originally scheduled to expire on december   the act was extended for two additional years and amended by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of the extension act 
the terrorism insurance program the program requires commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the united states to participate 
the extension act modified the provisions of the act by providing exclusions of certain insured coverages such as commercial automobile insurance  creating a program trigger for funding of certified events occurring after march  which exceed aggregate industry losses of million in and million in the us government funding for certified events will remain at of covered losses in  decreasing to of covered losses in each insurance company is subject to a deductible based upon a percentage of the previous year s direct earned premium  with the percentage increasing each year 
the program  as amended  runs through december  the company writes a limited number of commercial property policies generally not considered to be targets of terrorist activities such as airports  hotels  large office structures  amusement parks  landmark defined structures or other public facilities 
in addition  the company does not insure a high concentration of commercial policies in any one area where increased exposure to terrorist threats exists 
consequently  the company believes its exposure relating to acts of terrorism is low

risk factors the company s business involves various risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed in this section 
the information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and the other documents and materials filed by the company with the sec  as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company  or that it currently believes to be immaterial  may also adversely affect the company s business 
any of the following risks or uncertainties that develop into actual events could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the company and its business the company is a holding company that relies on regulated subsidiaries for cash to satisfy its obligations 
as a holding company  the company maintains no operations that generate revenue to pay operating expenses  shareholders dividends or principal or interest on its indebtedness 
consequently  the company relies on the ability of its insurance subsidiaries  and particularly its california insurance subsidiaries  to pay dividends for the company to meet its debt payment obligations and pay other expenses 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is regulated by state insurance laws  which limit the amount of  and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of  cash dividends 
generally  these insurance regulations permit the payment of dividends only out of earned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the inability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate  its business and financial position could be harmed 
the process of establishing property and liability loss reserves is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors  including underwriting quality  the frequency and amount of covered losses  variations in claims settlement practices  the costs and uncertainty of litigation  and expanding theories of liability 
while the company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating loss reserves  the company s methods may prove to be inadequate 
if any of these contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  results in loss reserves that are not sufficient to cover its actual losses  its results of operations  liquidity and financial position may be materially adversely affected 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations depend on the company s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result  price accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation availability of sufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  the company s ability to successfully innovate with new pricing strategies  the company s ability to forecast renewals of existing policies accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices  changing driving patterns  extra contractual liability arising from bad faith claims  weather catastrophes  unexpected medical inflation  and unanticipated inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could underprice risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the company s business are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the company s business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after the company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under the company s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
the company s private passenger insurance rates are subject to prior approval by the departments of insurance in most of the states in which the company operates  and to political influences 
in most of the states in which the company operates  it must obtain prior approval from the state department of insurance of the private passenger insurance rates charged to its customers  including any increases in those rates 
if the company is unable to receive approval of the rate increases it requests  the company s ability to operate its business in a profitable manner may be limited and its liquidity  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs  in the opinion of the company s management 
the homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure  particularly as regulators in catastrophe prone states seek an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
in addition  various insurance underwriting and pricing criteria regularly come under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation or regulations that would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company remains highly dependent upon california and several other key states to produce revenues and operating profits 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in california  in florida and in new jersey 
the company s financial results are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions in these states and changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
in  operations in california produced operating profits whereas operations in florida and new jersey produced operating losses 
if the company cannot maintain its am best ratings  it may not be able to maintain premium volume in its insurance operations sufficient to attain the company s financial performance goals 
the company s ability to retain its existing business or to attract new business in its insurance operations is affected by its rating by am best company 
am best company currently rates all of the company s insurance subsidiaries with sufficient operating history to be rated as either a superior or a excellent 
if the company is unable to maintain its am best ratings  the company may not be able to grow its premium volume sufficiently to attain its financial performance goals  and if am best were to downgrade the company s rating  the company could lose significant premium volume 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements  and any failure to meet these requirements could subject the company s insurance subsidiaries to regulatory action 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of their state of domicile 
the risk based capital standards  based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  require the company s insurance company subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the naic 
if any of the company s insurance subsidiaries fails to meet these standards and requirements  the department of insurance regulating such subsidiary may require specified actions by the subsidiary 
there is uncertainty involved in the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables 
the company reinsures a portion of its potential losses on the policies it issues to mitigate the volatility of the losses on its financial condition and results of operations 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases prevented  insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the company s risk through reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  as is customary  the company initially pays all claims and seeks to recover the reinsured losses from its reinsurers 
although the company reports as assets the amount of claims paid which the company expects to recover from reinsurers  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to collect from its reinsurers 
if the amounts actually recoverable under the company s reinsurance treaties are ultimately determined to be less than the amount it has reported as recoverable  the company may incur a loss during the period in which that determination is made 
the company depends on independent agents who may discontinue sales of its policies at any time 
the company sells its insurance policies through more than  independent brokers and agents 
the company must compete with other insurance carriers for these brokers and agents business 
some competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage  higher commissions  or more attractive non cash incentives 
to maintain its relationship with these independent agents  the company must pay competitive commissions  be able to respond to their needs quickly and adequately  and create a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 
if these independent agents find it preferable to do business with the company s competitors  it would be difficult to renew the company s existing business or attract new business 
state regulations may also limit the manner in which the company s producers are compensated or incentivized 
such developments could negatively impact the company s relationship with these parties and ultimately reduce revenues 
one independent broker of the company is responsible for a significant amount of the company s revenues  and the loss of business provided by that broker could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company markets its insurance policies primarily through independent agents and brokers 
one broker provided of the company s direct written premiums in the year ended december  loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by this broker could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in market interest rates or defaults may have an adverse effect on the company s investment portfolio  which may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s results are affected  in part  by the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments  such as municipal and corporate bonds 
increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities 
declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the company s investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than the company s investments have historically generated 
defaults in the company s investment portfolio may produce operating losses and reduce the company s capital and surplus 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
although the company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
the company s mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
despite its mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s book value 
the company s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events  particularly hurricanes  earthquakes  hail storms  explosions  tropical storms  fires  war  acts of terrorism  severe winter weather and other natural and man made disasters 
because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations  and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in the company s financial condition or results of operations from period to period 
although the company attempts to manage its exposure to such events  the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid 
the company s expansion plans may adversely affect its future profitability 
the company is currently expanding and intends to further expand its operations in several of the states in which the company has operations and into states in which it has not yet begun operations 
the intended expansion will necessitate increased expenditures 
the company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flow from operations 
the expansion may not occur  or if it does occur may not be successful in providing increased revenues or profitability 
if the company s cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover the increased costs of the expansion  or if the expansion does not provide the benefits anticipated  the company s financial condition and results of operations and ability to grow its business may be harmed 
the company may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
the company s future capital requirements depends on many factors  including its ability to write new business successfully  its ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses and the success of its current expansion plans 
the company may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce its assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to the company s shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
if the company cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and to maintain its policyholder data 
the company is developing and deploying new information technology systems that are designed to manage many of these functions across all of the states in which it operates and all of the lines of insurance it offers 
see item technology 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or any delay or failure in the full deployment of the company s new information technology systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power loss  unauthorized access  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
it is possible that a system failure  accident or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
following implementation of its new information technology systems  the company may from time to time install new or upgraded business management systems 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  the company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s results and financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if the company s auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on its stock price 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
as the company expands its operations  it must hire and train new employees  and retain current employees to handle the resulting increase in new inquiries  policies  customers and claims 
the failure of the company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could result in the company having to slow the growth of its business in some jurisdictions 
it could also affect the company s ability to develop and deploy information technology systems that are important to the success of the company 
in addition  the failure to adequately staff its claims and underwriting departments could result in decreased quality of the company s claims and underwriting operations 
the company s success also depends heavily upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces litigation risks which  if decided adversely to the company  could impact its financial results 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits 
these lawsuits are described more fully in item legal proceedings 
litigation  by its very nature  is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain 
the precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits is uncertain and may  if these lawsuits are determined adversely to the company  negatively impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and its results of operations  which could materially increase the company s costs and expenses 
in addition  potential litigation involving new claim  coverage and business practice issues could adversely affect the company s business by changing the way policies are priced  extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or increasing the size of claims 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim  coverage and business practice issues could negatively impact the company s revenues or its methods of doing business 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods employed by the company could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
various provisions of the company s policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which are intended to limit the company s risks  may not be enforceable in the manner the company intends 
in addition  the company s policies contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims and the company s right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition 
while the company s insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the company s loss exposure and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks  it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely effect the company s loss experience  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the company s industry the private passenger insurance business is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to compete effectively against larger  better capitalized companies 
the company competes with many property and casualty insurance companies selling private passenger automobile insurance in the states in which the company operates  many of which are better capitalized than the company and have higher am best ratings 
the superior capitalization of many of the company s competitors may enable them to offer lower rates  to withstand larger losses  and to take advantage more effectively of new marketing opportunities 
the company s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate 
the company s ability to compete against these larger  better capitalized competitors depends importantly on its ability to deliver superior service and its strong relationships with independent agents 
the company may from time to time undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth 
if the company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the company s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers  the company s competitive position may be harmed  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in a highly competitive industry such as the automobile insurance industry  some of the company s competitors may fail from time to time 
in the event of a failure of a major insurance company  the company could be adversely affected  as the company and other insurance companies would likely be required by state law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer  and as the company would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer s former policyholders 
the company may be adversely affected by changes in the personal automobile insurance business 
approximately of the company s direct written premiums for the year ended december  were generated from personal automobile insurance policies 
adverse developments in the market for personal automobile insurance  or the personal automobile insurance industry in general  whether related to changes in competition  pricing or regulations  could cause the company s results of operations to suffer 
this industry is also exposed to the risks of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms  hail and ice storms  hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes and  to a lesser degree  explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
the automobile insurance business is also affected by cost trends that impact profitability 
factors which negatively affect cost trends include inflation in automobile repair costs  automobile parts costs  used car prices and medical care 
increased litigation of claims  particularly those involving allegations of bad faith or seeking extra contractual and punitive damages  may also adversely affect loss costs 
the insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation  which may affect the company s ability to execute its business plan and grow its business 
the company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which its insurance subsidiaries is domiciled  as well as in the states where its insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products  issue policies and handle claims 
some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to operate  innovate  obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow its business profitably 
these regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders 
the company s ability to comply with these laws and regulations  and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner  is and will continue to be critical to its success 
some of these regulations include required licensing 
the company operates under licenses issued by the departments of insurance in the states in which the company sells insurance 
if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license  the company s ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
transactions between the company s insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates including the company generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior approval of the applicable regulator generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated 
state regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of some transactions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which the company conducts business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
if  as permitted in some states  the company begins using new rates before they are approved  it may be required to issue refunds or credits to the company s policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator 
accordingly  the company s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
most of the states in which the company operates have laws and regulations that limit its ability to exit a market 
for example  these states may limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies or they may prohibit the company from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received from the state insurance department 
in some states  these regulations extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
laws and regulations that limit the company s ability to cancel and non renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict the company s ability to exit unprofitable markets  which may harm its business and results of operations 
other regulations 
the company must also comply with regulations involving  among other things the use of non public consumer information and related privacy issues  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating  limitations on the ability to charge policy fees  limitations on types and amounts of investments  the payment of dividends  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  involuntary assignments of high risk policies  participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations  assessments and other governmental charges  reporting with respect to financial condition  periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners  and the other regulations discussed in this annual report on form k 
compliance with laws and regulations addressing these and other issues often will result in increased administrative costs 
in addition  these laws and regulations may limit the company s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately  prevent it from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and may restrict its ability to discontinue unprofitable relationships or exit unprofitable markets 
these results  in turn  may adversely affect the company s profitability or its ability or desire to grow its business in certain jurisdictions  which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the company s common stock 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in actions by regulators  fines and penalties  and in extreme cases  revocation of the company s ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  the company may face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 
regulation may become more extensive in the future  which may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that states will not make existing insurance related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws 
new or more restrictive regulation in any state in which the company conducts business could make it more expensive for it to continue to conduct business in these states  restrict the premiums the company is able to charge or otherwise change the way the company does business 
in such events  the company may seek to reduce its writings in  or to withdraw entirely from  these states 
in addition  from time to time  the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
the company cannot predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted  the timing of any such adoption and what effects  if any  they may have on the company s operations  profitability and financial condition 
assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds  second injury funds  catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce the company s profitability 
virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
many states also have laws that established second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury which are funded by either assessments based on paid losses or premium surcharge mechanisms 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states  the insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements  which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory shared market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce the company s profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow its business 
loss or significant restriction of the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal lines products could reduce the company s future profitability 
the company uses credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law 
some consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against people with low incomes  minority groups and the elderly and are calling for the prohibition or restriction on the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing 
laws or regulations that significantly curtail the use of credit scoring  if enacted in a large number of states  could reduce the company s future profitability 
risks related to the company s stock the company is controlled by a few large shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including change of control transactions 
george joseph and gloria joseph collectively own more than of the company s common stock 
accordingly  george joseph and gloria joseph have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the company may take in the future  including change of control transactions 
this concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the company s shareholders and the holders of its debt securities 
future sales of common stock may affect the market price of the company s common stock and the future exercise of options and warrants will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company may raise capital in the future through the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  such future sales will have on the market price of its common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the company s outstanding common stock  and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell common stock at a time and price that the shareholder deems appropriate 
in addition  the company has issued options to purchase shares of its common stock 
in the event that any options to purchase common stock are exercised  shareholders will suffer dilution in their investment 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of the company or the sale of any of its insurance subsidiaries 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company or any holding company of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the doi of the state where the insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of the insurer or holding company  the state doi will consider a number of factors relating to the acquiror and the transaction 
these laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company or the sale by the company of any of its insurance subsidiaries  including transactions that some or all of the company s shareholders might consider to be desirable 
although the company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past  it may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
the company has paid cash dividends on a consistent basis since the public offering of its common stock in november however  future cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors  including the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to make distributions to the company  which may be restricted by financial  regulatory or tax constraints 
also  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution

item legal proceedings the company is  from time to time  named as a defendant in various lawsuits incidental to its insurance business 
in most of these actions  plaintiffs assert claims for punitive damages  which are not insurable under judicial decisions 
the company has established reserves for lawsuits in cases where the company is able to estimate its potential exposure and it is probable that the court will rule against the company 
the company vigorously defends actions against it  unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate 
an unfavorable ruling against the company in the actions currently pending may have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the period of such ruling  however  it is not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
sam donabedian  individually and on behalf of those similarly situated v 
mercury insurance company  et al  was originally filed on april  in the los angeles superior court  asserting  among other things  a claim that the company s calculation of persistency discounts to determine premiums is an unfair business practice  a violation of the california consumer legal remedies act clra and a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the company originally prevailed on a demurrer to the complaint and the case was dismissed  however  the california court of appeal reversed the trial court s ruling  deciding that the california insurance commissioner does not have the exclusive right to review the calculation of insurance rates premiums 
after filing two additional pleadings  on june   the plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint asserting claims for violation of california business professions code section and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing the clra claim previously had been dismissed with prejudice 
plaintiff again sought injunctive relief  unspecified restitution and monetary damages as well as punitive damages and attorneys fees and costs 
without leave of court  the plaintiff also attempted to state claims for breach of contract and fraud 
the company filed a demurrer and motion to strike certain portions of the plaintiff s fourth amended complaint 
following a hearing on september   the court took the matter under submission 
while the motions were under submission  counsel for the plaintiff asked mercury to engage in settlement discussions 
the court agreed to stay the matter and counsel for the plaintiff and the company met on several occasions to seek resolution  but none was reached 
additionally  over the company s objection  on may   the trial court permitted the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights ftcr to file a complaint in intervention to allege that the company s calculation of persistency discounts constitutes a violation of insurance code section a and c 
following a ruling by the court of appeal in another case which found that there is no private right of action to allege violations of section  the company brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings to have ftcr s complaint in intervention dismissed 
that motion was heard on april  subsequent to the hearing  ftcr filed an amended complaint in intervention  and mercury again filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings  which the court denied at a hearing on july  in view of the then on going settlement discussions with the plaintiff  the company did not seek further appellate review of the court s ruling  but is now contemplating whether to challenge ftcr s participation in the case since the class settlement was not approved 
during the fall of  counsel for the plaintiff and the company met on several occasions in an effort to resolve the case 
ftcr was not invited to participate in these discussions 
when plaintiff and the company were not able to reach a resolution  the court ordered the parties to a settlement conference before another judge 
on august   following three settlement conferences  the company and the plaintiff reached a preliminary settlement which was subject to completion of the class approval process and was also subject to objections and review by the court 
prior to the hearing scheduled for october   the ftcr filed objections to the proposed settlement 
also  shortly before the hearing  the california doi filed a letter with the court contending that the terms of the settlement  which provided for a coupon to class members to be used toward the purchase of new  not renewal business  constituted a discount of insurance rates and thus would be subject to the california doi s approval 
following several delays and further briefing by the parties  at a hearing on february   the court declined to give preliminary approval to the proposed settlement 
accordingly  upon the company s request  the tentative ruling on the company s demurrer and motion to strike was unsealed 
the court sustained the company s demurrer to all but the section claim  as well as a claim for alleged violation of insurance code section which plaintiff s counsel now has indicated will be voluntarily dismissed 
the court also granted the company s request to strike the punitive damage claim 
it is expected that the court will establish a schedule for discovery and briefing on the issue of administrative estoppel that is whether the company s conduct was protected and or reasonable since the persistency discount was part of a rate filing plan approved by the california doi 
the parties have agreed to litigate this issue first 
while the ultimate outcome of this case cannot be anticipated at this time  the company will continue to vigorously defend this case 
in marissa goodman  on her own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated v 
mercury insurance company los angeles superior court  filed june   the plaintiff is challenging the company s use of certain automated database vendors to assist in valuing claims for medical payments 
the plaintiff filed a motion seeking class action certification to include all of the company s insureds from to the present who presented a medical payments claim  had the claim reduced using the computer program and whose claim did not reach the policy limits for medical payments 
on january   the court certified the requested class and scheduled a case management conference to discuss notifying class members 
the plaintiff alleges that these automated databases systematically undervalue medical payment claims to the detriment of insureds 
the plaintiff is seeking unspecified actual and punitive damages 
similar lawsuits have been filed against other insurance carriers in the industry 
the case has been coordinated with two other similar cases  and also with ten other cases relating to total loss claims 
the court denied the company s motion for summary judgment holding that there is an issue of fact as to whether ms 
goodman sustained any damages as a result of the company s handling of her medical payments claim 
the original trial date has been vacated by the court and not rescheduled 
the company is not able to evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or to estimate a range of potential loss in the event of an unfavorable outcome at the present time 
the company intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit jointly with the other defendants in the coordinated proceedings 
robert dolan  et al 
v 
mercury insurance company  et al  is a collective action claim filed in april of  in the united states district court for the middle district of florida 
the plaintiffs  former automobile policy field adjusters  claim that they and the members of the class they seek to represent were denied overtime compensation in violation of the federal fair labor standards act 
the plaintiffs are seeking certification of a nationwide class of field adjusters for a period of three years preceding the filing of the action  and recovery of allegedly unpaid overtime compensation  liquidated damages  and attorneys fees and costs 
the court has granted conditional certification for notice purposes 
in february  the company and the plaintiff reached a preliminary settlement which is subject to review and approval by the court 
the ultimate outcome of this case cannot be anticipated at this time and the company cannot determine if the settlement will be approved by the court or the potential impact of the settlement or the case  if the settlement is not approved  on the company s financial results

on february   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  the common stock dividend rate has increased at least once each year since dividends were initiated in january  for financial statement purposes  the company records dividends on the declaration date 
the company expects to continue the payment of quarterly dividends  however  the continued payment and amount of cash dividends will depend upon  among other factors  the company s operating results  overall financial condition  capital requirements and general business conditions 
as a holding company  mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its shareholders 
these subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict their ability to distribute dividends 
for example  california state laws permit a casualty insurance company to pay dividends and advances within any month period  without any prior regulatory approval  in an amount up to the greater of of statutory earned surplus at the preceding december  or statutory net income for the calendar year preceding the date the dividend is paid 
under the state restrictions  the direct insurance subsidiaries of the company may pay dividends to mercury general during of up to approximately million without prior regulatory approval

the company also offers homeowners insurance  mechanical breakdown insurance  commercial and dwelling fire insurance  umbrella insurance  commercial automobile and commercial property insurance 
private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for approximately of the billion of the company s direct premiums written in  with approximately of the private passenger automobile premiums written in california 
this overview discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company s performance  prospects and risks 
it is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management s discussion and analysis  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and all other items contained within this annual report on form k 
economic and industry wide factors regulatory uncertainty the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
the company has a successful track record of working with difficult regulations and new insurance commissioners 
however  there is no certainty that current or future regulations  and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the company 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers are losses which include medical costs  replacement automobile parts and labor repair costs 
there has recently been significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates are higher or lower than anticipated 
the company currently estimates low to mid single digit inflation rates on bodily injury coverages for its major california personal automobile lines for the accident year 
the inflation rate for this accident year is the most difficult to estimate because there remain many open claims 
should actual inflation be higher  the company could be under reserved for its losses and profit margins would be lower 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risks insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry  which has benefited the industry as a whole 
however  it is unknown if loss frequency in the future will continue to decline  remain flat or increase 
underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the company has historically seen premium growth in excess of during hard markets  whereas premium growth rates during soft markets have historically been in the single digits 
many of the company s major competitors reported very good operating results in through this typically signals a softening in the market  and consequently  the company experienced a decline in the rate of premium growth during revenues  income and cash generation the company generates its revenues through the sale of insurance policies  primarily covering personal automobiles and homeowners 
these policies are sold through independent agents and brokers who receive a commission on average of of net premiums written for selling and servicing the policies 
the company believes that it has a thorough underwriting process that gives the company an advantage over its competitors 
the company views its agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower prices yet realize better margins than many of its competitors 
the company also generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which was approximately billion at the end of this investment portfolio generated approximately million in pre tax investment income during the portfolio is managed by company personnel with a view towards maximizing after tax yields and limiting interest rate and credit risk 
the company s operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was approximately million in the company s cash flow from operations has exceeded million every year since and has been positive for over years 
cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and to help support growth 
opportunities  challenges and risks the company currently underwrites personal automobile insurance in thirteen states arizona  california  florida  georgia  illinois  michigan  nevada  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  pennsylvania  texas and virginia 
the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective of achieving greater geographic diversification  so that non california premiums eventually account for as much as half of the company s total premiums 
there are  however  challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company does not expect to enter into any new states until its nextgen computer system is successfully implemented in the majority of its existing states  which is expected to occur in see technology 
the company is also subject to risks inherent in its business  which include but are not limited to the following see also item a 
risk factors a catastrophe  such as a major wildfire  earthquake or hurricane  can cause a significant amount of loss to the company in a very short period of time 
a major regulatory change could make it more difficult for the company to generate new business or reduce the profitability of the company s existing business 
a sharp upward increase in market interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could cause a significant loss in the value of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent it is within the company s control  the company seeks to manage these risks in order to mitigate the effect that major events would have on the company s financial position 
technology the company is currently implementing a next generation nextgen computer system to replace its existing underwriting  billings  claims and commissions legacy systems that currently reside on hewlett packard mainframe computers 
the nextgen system is designed to be a multi state  multi line system that is expected to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as respond to legislative and regulatory changes more easily than the company s current systems 
the nextgen system is initially being deployed for the personal automobile line of business and has been successfully implemented in virginia  new york  and florida 
the company expects to implement nextgen in california in and the majority of its other states by the end of during  the company embarked on another major information technology project  internet business strategy ibs 
ibs is mainly comprised of three key areas agent facing applications  service oriented architecture  and customer facing applications 
ibs will provide the company s agents and brokers with an improved ability to access documents and forms and to perform transactions relevant to writing and maintaining their book of business through the agent portal  a single entry point to the company s suite of agency applications 
for customers and potential customers  ibs will provide the ability to obtain a quote and offer self services such as paying bills and reporting claims through the internet 
the service oriented architecture will allow for rapid changes and enhancements to the system to accommodate future business needs 
ibs is planned to be rolled out by phases starting in late nextgen and ibs are expected to play a key role in the company s future success 
as with any large scale technology implementation  risks associated with system implementation exist that could significantly impact the operations of the company and increase the expected costs of the project 
management has expended planning and development efforts to mitigate these risks 
general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the ability of the company to grow and retain business 
in management s view  through were periods of very good results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
as a result  the automobile insurance market is extremely competitive 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  the only state in which it operated prior to the company has since expanded its operations into the following states georgia and illinois  oklahoma and texas  florida  virginia and new york  new jersey  arizona  pennsylvania  michigan and nevada 
during  approximately of the company s total net premiums written were derived from california as compared to in the increase was the result of a decline in the volume of business written outside of california and an increase in the volume written within california 
the company has established a diversification goal to produce half of its business outside of california 
there are factors  some of which are outside of the company s control  that could prevent the company from achieving this goal 
effective july  concord insurance services  inc concord  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  engaged in agency operations in texas  sold the renewal and servicing rights of the business it serviced for mercury county mutual insurance company mcm  a mutual insurance company controlled by the company 
subsequent to the sale transaction  concord s purchasers continue to write premiums through mcm using the company s policy forms  and the premiums will continue to be reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the sale  the company recognized a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million during the quarter ended june  this impairment charge is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
the process for implementing rate changes varies by state  with california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada requiring prior approval from the doi before a rate may be implemented 
illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
during  the company had no rate increases in california and implemented automobile rate increases in only one of the twelve non california states 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing efforts  combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation make the company very competitive in california and in other states 
during  the company incurred approximately million in advertising expenses 
the california doi uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined in decreasing order of importance by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and other factors as determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
on july   the california office of administrative law approved proposed regulations by the california doi that effectively reduce the weight that insurers can place on a person s residence when establishing automobile insurance rates 
insurance companies in california are now required to file rating plans with the california doi that comply with the new regulations 
there is a two year phase in period for insurers to fully implement those plans 
as such  the company made a rate filing in august that reduced the territorial impact of its rates and requested a small overall rate increase 
additional rate filings will be required during the two year phase in period 
the doi has not yet approved the august filing  nor is there any assurance that it will 
in general  the company expects that the regulations will cause rates for urban drivers to decrease and those for non urban drivers to increase 
these rate changes are likely to increase consumer shopping for insurance which could affect the volume and the retention rates of the company s business 
it is the company s intention to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace while complying with the new regulations 
on april   new regulations governing the approval of property and casualty insurance rates will become effective in california 
these regulations generally tighten the existing proposition prior approval ratemaking regime primarily by establishing a maximum allowable rate of return of just below percent the average of short  intermediate and long term t bill rates  plus percent and a minimum allowable rate of return of negative percent of surplus 
however  the practical impact of these limitations is unclear because the california doi has yet to promulgate input values for surplus standards by line  efficiency standards  and reserve ratios 
in addition  the new regulations allow for the california doi to grant a number of variances based on service  loss prevention  business mix  service to underserved communities  and other factors 
the company anticipates the new regulations will be challenged in the courts either before their effective date or with their first application 
on january   the florida financial services commission approved new regulations requiring insurers to submit information to the florida office of insurance regulation oir regarding the use of credit reports and credit scores in establishing rules  rates or underwriting guidelines 
under the regulations  any insurer that uses credit scores or credit reports in filing a new rule  rate or underwriting guideline will be required to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that its credit scoring methodology does not disproportionately affect persons of any particular race  color  religion  marital status  age  gender  income level or place of residence 
the regulations were challenged by several insurance industry trade associations and were recently struck down by a florida administrative law judge  and hence  there is no near term compliance deadline 
it is uncertain if and how the oir intends to continue to pursue this change in the law 
the company intends to maintain its competitive position in the florida marketplace while complying with the new regulations if they are implemented 
in the january special session of the florida legislature  a bill designed to improve the availability and affordability of property insurance in florida was passed and subsequently signed by the governor 
among the significant provisions in the new law is a requirement that all companies that write private passenger automobile policies in florida also write homeowners policies in florida if they write homeowners policies in any other state 
the law also expands the availability of reinsurance through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  requires rate filings to reflect savings from the availability of such reinsurance  includes homeowners insurance under florida s existing excess profits regulations  and requires insurers to offer discounts for various deductible options and hurricane mitigation measures 
the company is closely monitoring the development of the regulations related to this new law  which are expected to become effective in the spring of the company is not able to determine the impact of any of the legal and regulatory changes described in the four paragraphs above 
however  it is possible that the impact could adversely affect the company and its results from operations 
on march   the california state board of equalization sbe upheld notices of proposed assessments issued against the company for tax years through in which the franchise tax board ftb disallowed a portion of the company s expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries on grounds that such expenses were allocable to the company s tax deductible dividends from such subsidiaries 
the sbe decision resulted in a smaller disallowance of the company s interest expense deductions than was proposed by the ftb in those years 
as a result of this ruling  the company recorded an income tax charge including penalties and interest of approximately million  after federal tax benefit  in the first quarter of the company believes that the deduction of the expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries is appropriate and intends to challenge the sbe decision in superior court 
the california ftb has audited the through tax returns and accepted the through returns to be correct as filed 
the company has not received examination results for the tax return 
for the   and tax returns  the ftb has taken exception to the state apportionment factors used by the company 
specifically  the ftb has asserted that payroll and property factors from mercury insurance services  llc  a subsidiary of mercury casualty company  that are excluded from the mercury general california franchise tax return  should be included in the california apportionment factors 
in addition  for the tax return  the ftb has asserted that a portion of management fee expenses paid by mercury insurance services  llc should be disallowed 
based on these assertions  the ftb issued notices of proposed tax assessments during for the  and tax years totaling approximately million 
the company strongly disagrees with the position taken by the ftb and plans to formally appeal the assessments before the sbe 
an unfavorable ruling against the company may have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the period of such ruling 
management believes that the issue will ultimately be resolved in favor of the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail on this matter 
the company is also involved in proceedings incidental to its insurance business 
see item legal proceedings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies reserves the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
 and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is required 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates  among other factors  can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of a claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
inflation is estimated and reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
the company performs its own loss reserve analysis and also engages the services of consulting actuaries to assist in the estimation of loss reserves 
the company and the actuaries do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates but rather calculate a point estimate 
as with any actuarial estimates  there is uncertainty in the company s estimates of ultimate losses 
this uncertainty comes from many factors which may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  uncertainty over inflation rates and uncertainty for unknown items 
the company does not make specific provisions for these uncertainties  rather it considers them in establishing its reserve by looking at historical patterns and trends and projecting these out to current reserves 
the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data and other relevant information 
at december   the company recorded its point estimate of approximately  million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which includes approximately million of incurred but not reported ibnr loss reserves 
ibnr includes estimates  based upon past experience  of ultimate developed costs which may differ from case estimates  unreported claims which occurred on or prior to december  and estimated future payments for reopened claims reserves 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provision 
the company analyzes loss reserves quarterly primarily using the incurred loss development  average severity and claim count development methods described below 
the company also uses the paid loss development method to analyze loss adjustment expense reserves and industry claims data as part of its reserve analysis 
when deciding which method to use in estimating its reserves  the company and its actuaries evaluate the credibility of each method based on the maturity of the data available and the claims settlement practices for each particular line of business or coverage within a line of business 
when establishing the reserve  the company will generally analyze the results from all of the methods used rather than relying on one method 
while these methods are designed to determine the ultimate losses on claims under the company s policies  there is inherent uncertainty in all actuarial models since they use historical data to project outcomes 
the company believes that the techniques it uses provide a reasonable basis in estimating loss reserves 
the incurred loss development method analyzes historical incurred case loss case reserves plus paid losses development to estimate ultimate losses 
the company applies development factors against current case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate expected losses 
the company believes that the incurred loss development method provides a reasonable basis for evaluating ultimate losses  particularly in the company s larger  more established lines of business which have a long operating history 
the claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count development for current claims 
the company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts 
the average severity method analyzes historical loss payments and or incurred losses divided by closed claims and or total claims to calculate an estimated average cost per claim 
from this  the expected ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated 
the average severity method coupled with the claim count development method provide meaningful information regarding inflation and frequency trends that the company believes is useful in establishing reserves 
the paid loss development method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid 
the company primarily uses this method for loss adjustment expenses because specific case reserves are generally not established for loss adjustment expenses 
in states with little operating history where there are insufficient claims data to prepare a reserve analysis relying solely on company historical data  the company generally projects ultimate losses using industry average loss data or expected loss ratios 
as the company develops an operating history in these states  the company will rely increasingly on the incurred loss development and average severity and claim count development methods 
the company analyzes hurricane catastrophe losses separately from non catastrophe losses 
for these losses  the company determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous storms and applies an average expected loss per claim based on reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous storms 
the company s consulting actuaries perform a quarterly analysis for the company s california  florida and new jersey automobile insurance lines of business comprising approximately of the company s business  a semi annual analysis for mechanical breakdown  homeowners and texas  georgia and illinois automobile insurance comprising approximately of the company s business  and an annual analysis for all other lines of business 
the company s consulting actuaries use multiple estimation methods for most of the company s lines of business  depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated 
the company considers the analysis performed by the consulting actuaries when establishing its reserves 
for the company s california automobile lines of business  the bodily injury bi reserves make up approximately of the total reserve  material damage  including collision  comprehensive  and property damage md reserves make up approximately of the total reserve  and loss adjustment expense reserves make up approximately of the total reserve 
the bi reserves account for such a large portion of the total because bi claims tend to close much slower than md claims 
the majority of the loss adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated costs to defend bi claims  so those reserves also tend to close more slowly than md claims 
loss development on md reserves is generally insignificant because md claims are closed quickly 
bi loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than most of the company s other coverages 
the company s bi policy covers injuries sustained by any person other than the insured  except in the case of uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist bi coverage  which covers damages to the insured for bi caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists 
bi payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages 
the following table represents the typical closure patterns of bi claims in the california automobile insurance coverage claims closed of total dollars paid bi claims closed in the accident year reported to bi claims closed one year after the accident year reported to bi claims closed two years after the accident year reported to bi claims closed three years after the accident year reported to claims that close during the initial accident year reported are generally the smaller  less complex claims that settle  on average  for approximately  to  whereas the average settlement  once all claims are closed in a particular accident year  is approximately  the company creates incurred loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish bi reserves 
the company may from time to time adjust development factors to account for trends it sees in loss severity 
the company estimates ibnr reserves as the difference between its projection of ultimate losses and the sum of payments the company has made and case basis reserves established for those losses 
assumptions  estimates and other factors that may impact the company s ultimate losses are discussed among the company s management and its internal or consulting actuaries  as the case may be  to determine the company s best estimate of ultimate losses 
through this process  the company s best estimate of ultimate reserves is recorded 
the results of this analysis are shared quarterly with the company s board of directors and the company s independent auditors 
the company reevaluates its reserves quarterly 
when management determines that the estimated ultimate claim cost requires reduction for previously reported accident years  positive development occurs and a reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
if the estimated ultimate claim cost requires an increase for previously reported accident years  negative development occurs and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
for  the company had negative development of approximately million on the and prior accident years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which at december  totaled approximately  million 
the majority of the negative development was recognized in the second quarter of the negative development primarily relates to increases in the company s and prior accident years loss estimates for personal automobile insurance in florida and new jersey totaling approximately million and million  respectively  offset by positive development of approximately million for business written in california 
in florida  a large portion of the million in adverse loss development relates to additional reserves recorded for large losses related primarily to extra contractual claims 
extra contractual losses are fairly infrequent but can amount to millions of dollars per claim  especially if the injured party sustained a serious injury such as a loss of a limb or paralysis 
consequently  these claims can have a large impact on the company s losses 
during  the company had extra contractual losses that settled for amounts much greater than the policy limits and much greater than expected 
as a result of these settlements  the company reevaluated its exposure to extra contractual claims in florida and increased its reserve estimates for prior accident years 
typically  extra contractual claims are those that settle for more than the policy limits because the original claim was denied  thus exposing the company to losses greater than the policy limits 
claims may be denied for various reasons  including material misrepresentations made by the insured on the policy application or insureds that have violated prohibitions in the insurance contract or when there is fraud involved 
during  the company established new claims handling and review procedures in florida  as well as in other states  that are intended to reduce the risk of receiving extra contractual claims 
consequently  the company does not expect that florida extra contractual claims will continue to have a significant impact on the financial statements or reserves in the future 
however  it is possible that these procedures will not prove entirely effective and the company may continue to have material extra contractual losses 
it is also possible that the company has not identified and established a sufficient reserve for all of the extra contractual losses occurring in the older accident years  even though a comprehensive claims file review was undertaken  or that the company will experience additional development on these reserves 
new jersey is a no fault state  which means that the majority of medical costs are paid directly by a policyholder s insurance company rather than by the insurance company of the person who was at fault in the accident 
this coverage is known as personal injury protection pip and in new jersey the standard policy has a statutory limit of  per person 
in new jersey  the bi coverage provides compensation for pain and suffering that is above and beyond the normal medical costs that are provided by the pip coverage 
the pip limits are very high in new jersey and the bi cases are often more complicated and expensive than in other states  therefore they tend to take longer to settle 
consequently  establishing reserves for these coverages in new jersey tends to be more difficult than in most of the company s other states 
adding to the reserving difficulty is the fact that the company has a very short operating history in new jersey  underwriting personal automobile insurance only since the fall of at year end  due to the lack of sufficient operating history  the company relied on industry loss data to determine the ultimate losses for the bi and pip coverage s in new jersey 
during  more claims from accident year matured and closed and it became apparent that the company was experiencing loss severities that were greater than those reserved for at december  as a result  the company revised its reserve approach and now utilizes an approach that compares accident year losses to industry loss data and then extrapolates that relationship to the less developed and accident years 
as a result of this  the company increased its reserve estimates for the and accident years by approximately million during the reserve approach utilized for new jersey assumes that there will not be significantly more development on the accident year claims  due to the maturity of those claims  and that the relationship between company loss data and industry loss data in accident year and will be similar to that experienced in accident year at december   the company recorded average bi loss severities that were higher than those from the industry loss data 
for every that recorded bi loss severities are increased on the and accident years  an additional loss reserve of approximately million would be required  with the converse holding true if the loss severities recorded were reduced 
as the and accident years continue to mature  there is likely to be additional development  however it is uncertain whether this development will be positive or adverse 
in california  the positive development of approximately million included reserve redundancies occurring in the bi coverage reserves for the california automobile insurance lines of business totaling approximately million for the year ended december  the company had redundancies and deficiencies in its other coverages and lines of business offered in california which net to an immaterial amount 
bi inflation for the most recent accident years is one of the most difficult components of the company s reserves to estimate because a large portion of the claims have not yet been settled 
as time passes and more claims from an accident year are settled  the actual inflation rate becomes more certain 
since there are still a significant number of open bi claims for the and accident years  it is possible that inflation rate assumptions will change as more claims are settled in the future 
at december   the company assumed bi inflation rates of approximately on the and accident years in establishing reserves for the california automobile lines of business 
the company estimates that each percentage point change in the inflation rate assumption would impact total losses on an individual accident year by approximately million 
premiums the company complies with the sfas no 
definition of how insurance enterprises should recognize revenue on insurance policies written 
the company s insurance premiums are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the policies  that is  in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  then a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business 
investments the company carries its fixed maturity and equity investments at market value as required for securities classified as available for sale by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

in most cases  market valuations were drawn from trade data sources 
in no case were any valuations made by the company s management 
equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges or trading markets  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
the company evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines and writes them off as realized losses through the consolidated statement of income  as required by sfas no 
 when recovery of the net book value appears doubtful 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
it is possible that future information will become available about the company s current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value 
the financial statement effect would be to move the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet to realized investment losses on the consolidated statement of income 
contingent liabilities the company may have certain known and unknown potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits relating to our business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the financial statement footnotes if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  management does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated operations or financial position 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased from the corresponding period in net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts written in the premium increases were principally attributable to increased policy sales

net premiums written is a non gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any effects of reinsurance 
net premiums written is a statutory measure used to determine production levels 
net premiums earned  the most directly comparable gaap measure  represents the portion of premiums written that are recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policies 
the following is a reconciliation of total company net premiums written to net premiums earned s for the years ended december  and  respectively net premiums written increase in unearned premiums earned premiums the loss ratio gaap basis in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in negative development on prior accident years increased the loss ratio by percentage points while positive development on prior accident years reduced the loss ratio by percentage points

liquidity and capital resources mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries to pay debt service costs and to make distributions to its shareholders 
under current insurance law  the insurance companies are entitled to pay  without extraordinary approval  ordinary dividends of approximately million in extraordinary dividends  defined by the doi  require doi extraordinary approval 
actual dividends paid from the insurance companies to mercury general during was million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in fixed maturity securities  equity securities and short term cash investments that could be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for the insurance companies are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for the insurance companies are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general and the purchase of investments 
through the insurance companies  the company has generated positive cash flow from operations for over twenty consecutive years  in excess of million every year since and over million for each of the past four years 
during this same period  the company has not been required to liquidate any of its fixed maturity investments to settle claims or other liabilities 
because of the company s long track record of positive operating cash flows  it does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities 
rather  the company manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on after tax income 
combined with cash and short term investments of million at december   the company believes its cash flow from operations is adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs  including future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions 
net cash provided from operating activities in was million  a decrease of million over the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the slowdown in growth of premiums reflecting a softening market condition in personal automobile insurance coupled with an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses paid in the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities primarily to increase its investment in fixed maturity securities  the purchase and development of information technology such as the nextgen and ibs computer systems and the payment of dividends to its shareholders 
excess cash was invested in short term cash investments 
funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of fixed maturity investments of  million  were primarily reinvested by the company in high grade fixed maturity securities 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded amortized cost of  million at december  by million

holdings in the taxable sector consist principally of investment grade issues 
at december   bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million representing of total investments 
this compares to approximately million at market cost million representing of total investments at december  the following table sets forth the composition of the investment portfolio of the company as of december  amortized cost market value amounts in thousands fixed maturity securities us government bonds and agencies municipal bonds mortgage backed securities corporate bonds redeemable preferred stock equity securities common stock public utilities banks  trusts and insurance companies industrial and other non redeemable preferred stock short term cash investments the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statement of income 
the company s assessment of other than temporary impairments is security specific as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and the company s intent to hold the securities until they mature or recover their value 
the company recognized million and million in realized losses as other than temporary declines to its investment securities during and  respectively

since the inception of the program in  the company has purchased  shares of common stock at an average price of 
the purchased shares were retired 
no stock has been purchased since the naic utilizes a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements that are compared to the company s actual capital level 
the formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has calculated the risk based capital requirements of each of the insurance companies as of december  each of the insurance companies policyholders statutory surplus exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
the company has no direct investment in real estate that it does not utilize for operations

the company is implementing a next generation nextgen computer system to replace its existing underwriting  billings  claims and commissions legacy systems 
the nextgen system has been successfully implemented in virginia  new york  and florida 
the company expects to implement nextgen in california in and the majority of its other states by the end of the company has currently spent approximately million on nextgen since during  the company embarked on another information technology project  internet business strategy ibs 
ibs will provide the company s agents and brokers with an improved ability to access resources relevant to writing and maintaining their book of business 
it will also provide customers and potential customers with the ability to obtain a quote and self services through the internet 
ibs is planned to be rolled out by phases starting in late the implementation costs of these two projects are well within the company s financial capacity and are expected to provide a positive benefit to the company for an extended future period 
the company has obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years after years amounts in thousands debt including interest lease obligations losses and loss adjustment expenses total contractual obligations notes to contractual obligations table the amount of interest included in the company s debt obligations was calculated using the fixed rate of on the senior notes and libor plus basis points or at december  on its mortgage note 
the company is party to an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligations on its senior notes for a floating rate of six month libor plus basis points 
using the effective annual interest rate of in  the total contractual obligations on debt would be million with million due within year  million due between and years  and million due in years and the company s outstanding debt contains various terms  conditions and covenants which  if violated by the company  would result in a default and could result in the acceleration of the company s payment obligations thereunder 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expenses do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the insurance companies of  million at december   and net premiums written of  million  the ratio of premium writings to surplus was to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised approximately of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities account for approximately of total investments at market value 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases and vice versa 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio is years at december  compared to years and years at december  and  respectively 
given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million 
at december   the company s strategy for common equity investments is an active strategy whose primary objective is current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation 
the market value of the equity investment consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to us treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  with all other factors remaining constant 
the common equity portfolio  representing approximately of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility and energy sector common stocks 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on its million fixed rate senior notes for a floating rate 
the interest rate swap has the effect of hedging the fair value of the senior notes
