bank holding companies are required to comply with the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ have adopted risk based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision are subject 
the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
old national s affiliate bank met all risk based capital requirements of the fdic and occ as of december  for old national s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of december   see note to the consolidated financial statements

risk factors old national s business could be harmed by any of the risks noted below 
in analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in old national  investors should consider  among other factors  the following risks related to old national s business old national operates in an extremely competitive market  and old national s business will suffer if old national is unable to compete effectively 
in old national s market area  the company encounters significant competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries 
the company s competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than old national does and may offer services that old national does not or cannot provide 
old national s profitability depends upon old national s continued ability to compete successfully in old national s market area 

table of contents we face risks with respect to future expansion 
we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and we may engage in de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying potential new markets  as well as acquisition and merger targets  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
the loss of key members of old national s senior management team could adversely affect old national s business 
old national believes that old national s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of old national s senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit old national 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of old national s key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect old national s business 
old national s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
the bank originates commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  agricultural real estate loans  agricultural loans  consumer loans  and residential real estate loans primarily within old national s market areas 
commercial real estate  commercial  consumer  and agricultural loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
commercial loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either the bank or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates 

table of contents if old national s actual loan losses exceed old national s allowance for loan losses  old national s net income will decrease 
old national makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of old national s loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of old national s borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of old national s loans 
despite old national s underwriting and monitoring practices  old national s borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms  and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
as a result  old national may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on old national s operating results 
since old national must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy  old national s current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
old national may need to significantly increase old national s provision for losses on loans if one or more of old national s larger loans or credit relationships becomes delinquent or if old national expands its commercial real estate and commercial lending 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review old national s allowance for loan losses and may require old national to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge offs 
material additions to old national s allowance would materially decrease old national s net income 
there can be no assurance that old national s monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that old national s allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses 
if old national forecloses on collateral property  old national may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
old national may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect old national s investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case old national will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that old national  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of old national s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes  insurance  and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate 
therefore  the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property  and old national may have to advance funds in order to protect old national s investment  or old national may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect old national s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 
a breach of information security or compliance breach by one of our agents or vendors could negatively affect old national s reputation and business 
old national relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing  communication and information exchange 
despite the safeguards instituted by old national  such systems are susceptible to a breach of security 
in addition  old national relies on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet old national s data processing and communication needs 
if confidential information is compromised  financial losses  costs and or other damages could occur 
such costs and or losses could materially affect old national s earnings 
fiduciary activity risk factor old national is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to old national s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to old national they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of old national and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the old national s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the old national s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks related to the banking industry changes in economic and political conditions could adversely affect old national s earnings  as old national s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing old national s loans decline 
old national s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic and political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  money supply and other factors beyond old national s control may adversely affect its asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the old national s earnings 
because old national has a significant amount of real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of old national s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
in addition  substantially all of old national s loans are to individuals and businesses in old national s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in old national s primary market areas which include indiana  kentucky and illinois could have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect old national s results of operations and financial condition 
old national s earnings depend substantially on old national s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates old national earns on loans  securities and other earning assets and ii the interest rates old national pays on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond old national s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
if market interest rates rise  old national will have competitive pressures to increase the rates old national pays on deposits  which could result in a decrease of old national s net interest income 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which old national is subject may adversely affect old national s results of operations 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of comptroller of the currency occ  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve and the state of indiana 
see business supervision and regulation herein 
applicable laws and regulations may change  and such changes may adversely affect old national s business 
such regulation and supervision of the activities in which an institution may engage is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing institutions  could have a material impact on old national and its operations 
changes in technology could be costly 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  old national needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  can be high in both absolute and relative terms 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that old national s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of old national 
risks related to old national s stock old national s charter documents and federal regulations may inhibit a takeover  prevent a transaction that may favor or otherwise limit old national s growth opportunities  which could cause the market price of old national s common stock to decline 

table of contents certain provisions of old national s charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of old national 
in addition  old national must obtain approval from regulatory authorities before acquiring control of any other company 
the price of old national s common stock may be volatile  which may result in losses for investors 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of old national s common stock 
the following factors may cause the market price for shares of old national s common stock to fluctuate announcements of developments related to old national s business  fluctuations in old national s results of operations  sales or purchases of substantial amounts of old national s securities in the marketplace  general conditions in old national s banking niche or the worldwide economy  a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and old national s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects 
we may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice 
old national has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to stockholders 
the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
any payment of dividends in the future will depend  in large part  on old national s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by old national s board of directors

general overview old national bancorp is a financial holding company incorporated in the state of indiana and maintains its principal executive offices in evansville  indiana

corporate developments in fiscal old national continues to focus on its key strategic initiatives strengthen the risk profile  enhance management discipline  and achieve consistent quality earnings 
credit quality trends remained favorable in nonperforming loans decreased approximately million during the year 
nonperforming loans were of total loans at december   down from at december  the allowance for loan losses equaled of nonperforming loans at december  compared to at december  net charge offs were of average loans in compared to in the commercial and consumer loan portfolio declined year over year due to the challenging midwest market environment and the company s desire to lower future potential credit risk 
commercial loans increased almost year over year  but were offset by declines in commercial and residential real estate 
contributing to this decrease in was old national s sale of its financial center located in o fallon  illinois  selling approximately million of commercial and consumer loans and the company s bulk sale of primarily commercial real estate loans in the amount of million 
core deposit growth was also challenged  decreasing slightly year over year 
the sale of o fallon included the assignment of million in deposits 
during the fourth quarter of  old national sold its three main office buildings in downtown evansville  but plans to continue operating out of these offices under long term operating leases 
the sale of these non earning assets has allowed old national to reduce its long term borrowings which will positively impact the company s margin going forward 
occupancy expense will increase in and future years as a result of leasing these buildings  negatively effecting the efficiency ratio  however  the overall transaction should be slightly accretive to earnings 
subsequent to year end  the company closed on its purchase of st 
joseph capital corporation 
management believes this acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in northern indiana 
in addition  old national continues to expand in indianapolis  indiana  and louisville  kentucky  markets which have stronger economic growth than other markets in which the company operates 

table of contents business outlook the company s near term challenges include improving its net interest rate margin  increasing loan and deposit growth  and containing expenses 
the company will focus on balance sheet restructuring early in in an effort to successfully integrate st 
joseph and to improve the margin by eliminating lower spread business

net interest income and net interest margin in the following discussion are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which adjusts tax exempt interest income to an amount that would be comparable to interest subject to income taxes 
net income is unaffected by these taxable equivalent adjustments as an offsetting increase of the same amount is made in the income tax section 
net interest income included taxable equivalent adjustments of million for and million for net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources and interest rate fluctuations 
other factors include accelerated prepayments of mortgage related assets and the maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities 
funding from client deposits generally cost less than wholesale funding sources 
factors  such as general economic activity  federal reserve board monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments  can also exert significant influence on old national s ability to optimize its mix of assets and funding and its net interest income and margin 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million in  a decrease from the million reported in the net interest margin was for  a six basis point increase compared to the reported in average earning assets declined by million  which consisted of decreased investment securities of million and decreased loans of million partially offset by an increase in federal funds sold and money market investments of million 
the yield on average earning assets increased basis points from to 
average interest bearing liabilities declined by million or  which included decreased borrowings of million and decreased interest bearing deposits of million 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to 
noninterest bearing deposits declined by million 
the increase in interest rates which began during the second half of and has continued through has had a notable effect on the volume  mix and yield of average earning assets

table of contents investment securities old national classifies investment securities primarily as available for sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed  based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in the company s funding requirements 
however  old national also has some and year fixed rate mortgage pass through securities in its held to maturity investment portfolio 
at december   old national does not believe any individual unrealized loss on available for sale securities represents other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates 
old national has both the intent and ability to hold the securities for a time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
at december   the investment securities portfolio was billion compared to billion at december   a decrease of 
investment securities represented of earning assets at december   compared to at december  during and continuing through  old national decreased the size of the investment portfolio and used the cash flows generated by the declining investment portfolio to reduce borrowed funds 
stronger commercial loan demand would likely result in increased investments in loans and a continued reduction in the investment securities portfolio 
investment securities available for sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of million at december   compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  these unrealized losses are driven by interest rate conditions 
the decrease was primarily the result of the smaller portfolio of securities available for sale and the shorter duration at december   compared to december  also  old national realized pre tax net gains on sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio of million during and million during as a result of a planned reduction  the investment portfolio had an effective duration of years at december   compared to years at december  the weighted average yields on available for sale investment securities were in and in the average yields on the held to maturity portfolio were in and in at december   old national had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values million by indiana  which represented of shareholders equity

allowance for loan losses to provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit  old national maintains an allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is based upon the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and includes an assessment of individual problem loans  actual loss experience  current economic events and regulatory guidance 
additional information about old national s allowance for loan losses is included in the risk management credit risk section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  a decrease of million compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans  the allowance decreased to at december   from at december  during  the provision for loan losses amounted to million  a decrease of million from the amount recorded in the lower provision in is attributable to a decrease in net charge offs combined with a decrease in nonaccrual loans over the last twelve months 
also considered is the company s migration loss rates which are declining as credits issued under the company s enhanced credit administration and underwriting functions  begun in  become more representative of the existing portfolio 
for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the reserve decreased by million at december   compared to december  the reserve as a percentage of that portfolio decreased to at december   from at december  nonaccrual loans decreased million  or  since december  
table of contents net charge offs as a percent of average loans were for the year ended december   the lowest level since the reserve for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio decreased to at december   from at december  this decrease was reflective of a lower residential real estate loan loss rate used to calculate reserve need for december  compared to the same period for the reserve for consumer loans decreased to at december   from at december  the higher rate in was reflective of the increased losses experienced in this portfolio due  in part  to the change in consumer bankruptcy laws in late allowance for losses on unfunded commitments old national maintains an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements 
the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses  modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment 
this allowance is reported as a liability on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities  while the corresponding provision for these loan losses is recorded as a component of other expense 
as of december  and  the allowance for losses on unfunded commitments was million and million  respectively 
residential loans held for sale residential loans held for sale were million at december   compared to million at december  residential loans held for sale are loans that are closed  but not yet purchased by investors 
the amount of residential loans held for sale on the balance sheet varies depending on the amount of originations and timing of loan sales to the secondary market 
the decrease in residential loans held for sale from december   is primarily attributable to the bulk sale of approximately million of loans during the first quarter of  lower loan production in and the timing of loan sales to the secondary market 
prior to september   these loans were sold with loan servicing retained 
in the fourth quarter of  in an effort to reduce the overall volatility in the company s earnings stream  old national started selling loans with servicing released 
premises and equipment premises and equipment  a large component of the company s non earning assets  totaled million at december   a decrease of million or since december  the primary reason for this decrease was the sale and leaseback of old national s three main buildings in downtown evansville  indiana in the fourth quarter of the assets involved in the sale and leaseback had a carrying value of approximately million 
during  premises and equipment decreased million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of five financial centers in clarksville  tennessee in funding total average funding  comprised of deposits and wholesale borrowings  was billion at december   a decrease of from billion at december  average deposits decreased in compared to a decrease of in total deposits were billion  including billion in transaction accounts and billion in time deposits at december  total deposits decreased or million compared to december   which includes the sale of million in deposits associated with the o fallon  illinois financial center

table of contents risk management overview old national management  with the oversight of the board of directors  has in place company wide structures  processes  and controls for managing and mitigating risk 
the following discussion addresses the three major risks facing old national credit  market  and liquidity 
credit risk credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms 
old national s primary credit risk results from the company s lending activities 
community based lending personnel  along with region based independent underwriting and analytic support staff  extend credit under guidelines established and administered by old national s risk and credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  includes members from both the holding company and the bank  as well as outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  credit exposures  peer comparisons  problem loans and charge offs and reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
old national lends primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
as measured by old national at december   the company had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of its portfolio and has no exposure to foreign borrowers or lesser developed countries 
four measured industry categories  lessors of residential buildings and dwellings  lessors of nonresidential buildings  crop farming and durable goods did exceed internal guidelines which set out recommended maximum limits of loan commitments as a percent of capital 
management will continue to monitor these industry categories 
old national s policy is to concentrate its lending activity in the geographic market areas it serves  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky 
old national continues to be affected by weakness in the economy of its principal markets  particularly in its home state of indiana 
management expects that trends in under performing  criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens 

table of contents the following table presents the components of under performing assets for the years ended december asset quality dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans renegotiated loans past due loans still accruing days or more commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total past due loans foreclosed properties total under performing assets classified loans includes nonaccrual  renegotiated  past due days and other problem loans criticized loans total criticized and classified loans asset quality ratios non performing loans total loans under performing assets total loans and foreclosed properties under performing assets total assets allowance for loan losses under performing assets loans include residential loans held for sale 
non performing loans include nonaccrual and renegotiated loans 
under performing assets are closely monitored by old national management and consist of nonaccrual loans where the ultimate collectibility of interest or principal is uncertain  loans renegotiated in some manner  primarily to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments because the borrower s financial condition deteriorated  loans with principal or interest past due ninety days or more  and foreclosed properties 
under performing assets totaled million at december  and million at december  as a percent of total loans and foreclosed properties  under performing assets at december were for and for the nonaccrual category of under performing loans was million at december   a decrease of million since december  at december   the allowance for loan losses to under performing assets ratio stood at compared to at december  classified loans  including nonaccrual  renegotiated  past due days and other problem loans  were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  of this total  other problem loans  which are loans reviewed for the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  criticized loans  or special mention loans  were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  management believes it has taken a prudent approach to the evaluation of under performing  criticized and classified loans  and the loan portfolio in general both in acknowledging the portfolio s general condition and in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
loan officers and credit underwriters jointly grade the larger commercial and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio periodically as determined by loan policy requirements or determined by specific guidelines based on loan characteristics as set by management and banking regulation 
periodically  these loan grades are reviewed independently by the loan review department 
for impaired loans  an assessment is conducted as to whether there is likely loss in the event of default 
if such a loss is determined to be likely  the loss is quantified and a specific reserve is assigned to the loan 
for the balance of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  loan 
table of contents grade migration analysis coupled with historic loss experience within the respective grades is used to develop reserve requirement ranges 
these reserve requirement ranges are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans

net charge offs include write downs on loans transferred to held for sale 
management believes that it has appropriately identified and reserved for its loan losses at december  management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non performing loans and will consider the possibility of additional sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional write downs to the allowance for loan losses 
interest income of approximately million and million would have been recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans outstanding at december  and  respectively if such loans had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms

interest rate risk is old national s primary market risk and results from timing differences in the re pricing of assets and liabilities  changes in the slope of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
old national manages interest rate risk within an overall asset and liability management framework that includes attention to credit risk  liquidity risk and capitalization 
a principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
asset and liability management activity is governed by a policy reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors has delegated the administration of this policy to the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  and the executive balance sheet management committee  a committee comprised of senior executive management 
the funds management committee meets quarterly and oversees adherence to policy and recommends policy changes to the board 
the executive balance sheet management committee meets quarterly 
this committee determines balance sheet management strategies and initiatives for the company 
a group comprised of corporate and line management meets monthly to implement strategies and initiatives determined by the executive balance sheet management committee 
old national uses two modeling techniques to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company  net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
net interest income at risk is used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the impact of changing rates over a two year horizon 
economic value of equity is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
these models simulate the likely behavior of the company s net interest income and the likely change in the company s economic value due to changes in interest rates under various possible interest rate scenarios 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the company s net interest income and value  old national recognizes that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for this reason  old national models many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 

table of contents policy guidelines  in addition to december  and results  are as follows net interest income month policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone red zone n a net interest income month cumulative policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone red zone n a economic value of equity policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone red zone n a red zone policy limits represent old national s absolute interest rate risk exposure compliance limit 
policy limits defined as green zone represent the range of potential interest rate risk exposures that the funds management committee believes to be normal and acceptable operating behavior 
yellow zone policy limits represent a range of interest rate risk exposures falling below the bank s maximum allowable exposure red zone but above its normally acceptable interest rate risk levels green zone 
at december   modeling indicated old national was within the green zone policy limits for all net interest income at risk and economic value of equity scenarios 
old national s green zone is considered the normal and acceptable interest rate risk level 
old national uses derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  as one method to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
the company s derivatives had an estimated fair value loss of million at december   compared to an estimated fair value loss of million at december  in addition  the notional amount of derivatives decreased by million 
the increase in market value is primarily due to the reduction in the notional amount of the derivatives in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and  along with the balance sheet management 
table of contents committee  monitors liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure old national has the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts 
the company maintains strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 
old national s ability to raise funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of the company s credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
standard and poor s  moody s investor service and dominion bond rating services have each issued a stable outlook in conjunction with their ratings as of december  fitch rating services issued a negative outlook in conjunction with their ratings as of december  the senior debt ratings of old national bancorp and old national bank at december   are shown in the following table

critical accounting policies and estimates old national s accounting policies are contained in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 
certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates  which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgement and assumptions  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance in the near future 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
old national s policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 

table of contents old national monitors the quality of its loan portfolio on an on going basis and uses a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining its allowance for loan losses 
old national records provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for the company s highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect old national s borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
old national has a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews and regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
old national uses migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for non retail loans that are not impaired 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
old national calculates migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of allowance for consumer and residential real estate loans 
management s analysis of probable losses in the portfolio at december   resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million with the potential effect to net income ranging from a decrease of million to an increase of million 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
goodwill and intangibles 
for acquisitions  old national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives for which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset with subsequent reversal of the impairment loss being prohibited 
the determination of fair values is based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
changes in these factors  as well as downturns in economic or business conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangible assets and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 
derivative financial instruments 
as part of the company s overall interest rate risk management  old national uses derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are significantly offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the company no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment  all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  resulting in greater volatility in our earnings 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation 
table of contents of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments used by the company have active markets and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis
