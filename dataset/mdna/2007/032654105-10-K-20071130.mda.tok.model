in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business and related support operations  or baseband chipset business  to mediatek inc we have reflected the financial results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for all years presented 
the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of november  and october  unless otherwise noted  this management s discussion and analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations 
results of operations overview fiscal year total revenue gross margin net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations as a of total revenue diluted eps from continuing operations diluted eps the year to year revenue changes by end market and product category is more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product 
revenue trends by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product  the sold to customer information  the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated 
as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve  the categorization of products by end market can vary over time 
when this occurs  we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each end market 

table of contents of of of total total total product product product revenue revenue y y revenue revenue revenue revenue industrial communications consumer computer total product revenue revenue from one time ip license total revenue industrial the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market 
these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers 
the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was a result of a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market 
communications the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of an increase in sales to customers in the wireless basestation and analog wireless handset end markets 
the increase in sales in these end markets was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers 
the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of an increase in sales of our products sold to customers in the wireless basestation end market and to a lesser extent  an increase in sales of our products sold into optical applications 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers as a result of the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line  which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal consumer the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications  advanced television systems and digital home applications 
the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and advanced television systems and to a lesser extent in a broad array of audio and video applications 
computer the year to year decreases in each of the last two fiscal years was the result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers 
revenue from one time ip license during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded revenue of million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party 
revenue trends by product the following table summarizes revenue by product categories 
the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products  the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications 
the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time 
in instances where products move between 
table of contents product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each product category

sales of products in the power management and reference product category were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers 
the year to year declines from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to fiscal  in the dsp product category were primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose dsp products 
revenue trends by geographic region the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last three years is as follows fiscal year region united states europe japan china rest of asia the predominant countries comprising rest of asia are taiwan and korea 
there was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents gross margin fiscal year gross margin gross margin gross margin in fiscal decreased by basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics  which currently earn relatively lower gross margins than our average gross margin 
this decrease was partially offset by the million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 
fiscal year cost of sales also included approximately million of restructuring related expenses  of which million was accelerated depreciation 
gross margin in fiscal decreased by basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal this decrease was the result of recognizing million of stock based compensation expense  restructuring related and acquisition related expenses in cost of sales in fiscal the restructuring expense primarily related to accelerated depreciation of million 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by an increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal as compared to fiscal stock based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal  on october   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions 
one of the key assumptions is expected volatility 
for options granted prior to fiscal  we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options 
we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility 
this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook  which included consultations with several third party advisors 
we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market s current expectations of future volatility 
historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines 
we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas r under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirement of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that were unvested on the effective date 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas r 
we used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
upon adoption of sfas r on october   we switched to the straight line attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after october  the expense associated with the unvested portion of the pre adoption grants continues to be expensed using the graded attribution method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r on october   we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after december  that had exercise prices of per share or greater 
the vesting of options issued to our corporate officers and directors was not accelerated 
unvested options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
because the exercise 
table of contents price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification  no stock based compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with apb opinion no 
the primary purpose for modifying the terms of these out of the money stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  because the approximately million million net of tax of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification 
our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal  are million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal were and lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion we expect that stock based compensation related to our adoption of sfas r will reduce diluted eps by approximately in the first quarter of fiscal our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal  were million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal were and lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion as of november   the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately million before tax consideration  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
research and development r d fiscal year r d expenses r d expenses as a of product revenue r d expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal the increase in r d expense was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense during fiscal as compared to fiscal r d expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal the increase in r d expense in fiscal was primarily the result of recognizing million of stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r and an increase in employee bonus expense 
these increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal r d expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products  and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 

table of contents selling  marketing  general and administrative smg a fiscal year smg a expenses smg a expenses as a of product revenue smg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  from the levels recorded in fiscal the increase in smg a expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense and an extra week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense and million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in the second quarter of fiscal smg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  from the levels recorded in fiscal the increase in smg a expenses was primarily the result of recording million of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r and higher employee salary  benefit and bonus expenses 
these increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal purchased in process research and development fiscal year ttpcom limited integrant audioasics total purchased in process r d we incurred charges totaling million for the write off of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal there were no charges for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal or see acquisitions below for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
special charges closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or sfas  under our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees and general and administrative employees 
the severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service  and employees had to continue to be employed until they were involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
we completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal in addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional expense during fiscal  which consisted of million of non cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and million for stay on bonuses 
we reversed approximately million of our severance accrual during fiscal because some employees voluntarily left the company  other employees found alternative employment within the company  and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments  normally paid as income continuance  were paid in lump sum payments  which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments 
we have terminated the employment of all of the remaining employees included in this action 

table of contents we ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on november  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional expense  in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which consisted of million for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge  in accordance with sfas  which included million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal also included in this special charge was million for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred 
the clean up activity was completed during the second quarter of fiscal  and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action 
the closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately million per year beginning in fiscal these annual savings include approximately million in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings  and approximately million in smg a expenses 
at current demand levels  if this facility were still in operation  the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities 
reorganization of product development and support programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal and the write off of property  plant and equipment and other items at this facility 
the remaining million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million of this charge was for contract termination costs 
the remaining million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
the remaining million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed approximately million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company  and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments 
the employment of all employees included in this action has been terminated 
we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action 
these organizational changes  which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal  are expected to result in savings of approximately million per year 
these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately million in r d expenses  approximately million in smg a expenses and approximately million in cost of sales 
a portion of these savings associated with these charges is reflected in our fiscal results 

table of contents fourth quarter of fiscal special charges consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to focus the wafer fabrication capacity at our limerick facility on eight inch technology 
certain manufacturing processes and products produced on our six inch production line will transition to our existing eight inch production line in limerick while others will transition to external foundries 
the charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees 
production is expected to cease in the six inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of  and the affected employees will be terminated 
these employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal year of approximately million related to cleanup and closure costs 
in accordance with sfas  these costs will be expensed as incurred 
the closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately million per year  expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal these annual savings will be in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings 
reduction of overhead infrastructure costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth 
in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business 
as a result of these decisions  we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing  engineering and smg a to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure 
consequently  we recorded a special charge of million  of which million is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
the remaining million is for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use 
as of november   of the employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us 
these employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
these cost reduction actions are expected to result in savings of approximately million per year once substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately million in r d expenses  approximately million in smg a expenses and approximately million in cost of sales 
operating income from continuing operations fiscal year operating income from continuing operations operating income from continuing operations as a of total revenue operating income increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was the result of a million increase in revenue  which was offset by a reduction in gross margin percentage and a million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling  marketing  general and administrative  special charges and purchased in process research and development 
the million  or  increase in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of a increase in revenue 
this increase was partially offset by million of stock based operating expenses associated with the adoption of sfas r and the million write off of purchased in process research and development as a result of our fiscal acquisitions 
in addition  the special charges in fiscal were lower by million than the special charges recorded in fiscal 
table of contents nonoperating income expense fiscal year interest expense interest income other  net total nonoperating income the million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease in interest income was partially offset by a million gain from the sale of an investment and a million settlement we received in fiscal in fiscal  we also recognized a million gain on the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line 
nonoperating income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher interest income  which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal nonoperating income for fiscal also included a million gain on the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal provision for income taxes fiscal year provision for income taxes effective income tax rate our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was higher by basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of million associated with the completion of an internal revenue service  or irs  examination during fiscal  including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit 
the increase was also attributable to the following fiscal transactions  which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the one time receipt of million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party  the gain on the sale of an investment of million and the million received from the settlement of litigation 
in addition  we recorded an additional million of taxes and penalties in fiscal for proposed adjustments related to the irs examination of fiscal and fiscal and a million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal acquisition 
these items were partially offset by a tax benefit of million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in fiscal and a million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal results 
the tax rate was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of million associated with the completion of an irs examination during fiscal  including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit 
in addition  the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below 
on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
during fiscal  we repatriated  million of accumulated foreign earnings  taking the benefit of current tax law allowing for earnings repatriated prior to october  to be taxed at a reduced effective tax rate 
in connection with the repatriation of earnings  we recorded additional income tax expense of million in fiscal 
table of contents we had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the m limitation of the internal revenue code would not withdraw their balances from the analog devices  inc deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan  while they were still subject to the m limitation  and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal  generally upon their retirement 
due to changes in tax law during that were enacted as part of the ajca  the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans changed 
in fiscal three executive officers who were subject to the m limitation withdrew  or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan 
as a result  we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal of million due to the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan 
net income from continuing operations fiscal year net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations as a of total revenue diluted eps from continuing operations net income from continuing operations was lower in fiscal than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal  partially offset by the million increase in operating income from continuing operations 
net income from continuing operations increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of the increase in revenue  the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense 
this increase in net income was partially offset by a year to year increase in operating expenses of million  primarily as a result of million of stock based operating expenses related to the adoption of sfas r and million of operating expenses related to our acquisitions during fiscal these operating expense increases were partially offset by a million decrease in special charges in fiscal as compared to fiscal the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
discontinued operations fiscal year net loss income from discontinued operations diluted loss earnings per share from discontinued operations we entered into a definitive agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal to sell our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc accordingly  these operations have been presented as a discontinued operation within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

the anticipated closure of the sale of our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and the anticipated closure of the sale of our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to on semiconductor 
table of contents corporation are expected to generate approximately million to million of cash in fiscal after the payment of all applicable taxes 
fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory days cost of sales in inventory we use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory 
accounts receivable at the end of fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount at the end of fiscal this increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of fiscal as compared to the last month of fiscal inventories at the end of fiscal decreased by million  or  from the amount at the end of fiscal and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal decreased by days from the amount at the end of fiscal the decrease in inventory is a result of our continued effort to balance production  demand and inventory levels as well as the sale of inventory valued at approximately million at october  which had been built during fiscal in anticipation of the closure of the sunnyvale  california wafer fabrication facility 
current liabilities increased to million at november   an increase of million  or  from million at the end of fiscal net additions to property  plant and equipment including that related to our baseband chipset business  which is reflected as a discontinued operation  were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of million in fiscal the payment of future dividends  if any  will be based on several factors including our financial performance  outlook and liquidity 
after the end of the fiscal year  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend is payable on december  to shareholders of record on december  and is expected to total approximately million 
on may   our board of directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our board of directors on august  from million to billion 
on march   our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional billion of our common stock  increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from billion to billion of our common stock 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional billion of our common stock  increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from billion to billion 
on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional billion of our common stock  increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from billion to billion 
under the repurchase program  we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors  the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  million of our common stock under this plan 
as of november   we had million of authorized repurchases remaining under our repurchase program 
we plan to continue to repurchase shares during fiscal the timing and number of shares repurchased can not be reasonably estimated at this time  however  from the end of fiscal year through november   we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million 

table of contents the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  payment due by period less than more than thousands total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases a deferred compensation plan b pension funding c total a certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses 
these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation 
prior to january   participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before july  the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment 
since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the more than years column of the table 
all other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability 
c our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
at november   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet financing as of november   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
unless specifically mentioned  these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  divestitures  or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report 
these statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by the company 
upon entering into the definitive agreement to sell our cpu voltage regulator and pc thermal monitoring 
table of contents business on november   the assets of this business met the held for sale criteria  and will therefore be reclassified as discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal this business generated approximately million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal therefore  once we reclassify the million of revenue to discontinued operations  our fourth quarter revenue will be million 
on this basis  we expect product sales from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal to be approximately million to million 
gross margin percentage is planned to be up slightly in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal diluted eps is planned to be approximately to for the first quarter of fiscal as previously announced  we also expect to close on the sales of two businesses in the first quarter of fiscal the estimated gains on these sales are not reflected in the estimates above 
we expect to realize a gain  net of tax  of between approximately million and million related to the sale of our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc we also expect to recognize a gain  net of taxes of between approximately million and million related to the sale of our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business 
the gains on both of these sales will be included in income from discontinued operations 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   which is our fiscal year that begins on november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal year that begins on november  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for prior year misstatements in september  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
the adoption of sab in the first quarter of fiscal did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur 
it also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers fiscal year 
sfas was effective for us at the end of fiscal  except for the change in measurement date  which is effective for us in fiscal the adoption of sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fin may have on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory 
while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 

table of contents long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
at november   we had gross deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents stock based compensation the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal required that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
for options granted prior to fiscal  we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options 
we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted for fiscal and thereafter from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility 
this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook  which included consultations with several third party advisors 
historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time when our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines 
we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior  and as such  we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market s current expectations of future volatility 
in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that options in the company s common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges  the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options  the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options  and the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes grant date valuation 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
in general  the longer the expected term used in the black scholes valuation model  the higher the grant date fair value of the option 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option 
until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter s cash dividend  the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption 
cash dividends are not paid on options  restricted stock or restricted stock units 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of november  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent 
table of contents liability should be recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of november  and october   our annual interest income would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at november  and october  would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months 
the fair values of these instruments were approximately million at november  and were insignificant at october  currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro  primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november  and october   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
for contracts outstanding at november   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our fiscal year end would increase the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments by approximately million and a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would decrease their fair value by approximately million 
as at october   a movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our fiscal year end would not expose us to significant gains or losses in the contracts fair values 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
